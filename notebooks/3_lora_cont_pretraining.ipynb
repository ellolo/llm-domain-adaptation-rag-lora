        "This notebook performs [Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09673) of `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` and `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` on a domain-specific raw text dataset using [Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685). The goal is to obtain a fine-tuned model that answers user questions on that domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this noebook, I use the Chtulhu game as the target domain, and the Chtulhu Rulebook as textual fine-tuning dataset. The idea is to use the fine-tuned model while playing the Game of Chtulhu, to answer players' questions regarding the rules of the game.\n",

        "## Continued Pretraining vs. Instruction (QA) fine-tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "The typical approach to adapt a base model to answer questions related to a target domain is to perform Question Answering fine-tuning, or, more boradly Instruction Fine Tuning (IFT, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09673) for a survey): the base model is fed a dataset of Question Answering pairs related to the domain, thus learning to answer similar questions. In addition, in order to spare memory, this fine-tuning is performed using Lora. I have implemented this approach in `2_lora_qa_finetuning.ipynb`.\n",
        "\n",
        "A different approach, presented in this Notebook, is to feed the base model with raw text documents that enclose the domain knowledge. The advantage is here that the domain knolwedge is explicitly and naturally described in the text, instead of being artifically summarized in a dataset of QA pairs, as done in IFT. This should lead the model to better learn the domain. However, there is a risk that after this additional training phase (which does not contain QA pairs),the model has 'forgot' how to answer questions.\n",

        "3. Setup and configure the Lora model. This means that we create low-dimensional Lora adapters on top of specific layers of the base model, and fine-tune the weights of these adapters, leaving the weights of the original base model untouched, thus saving time and VRAM. I add Lora adapeters to all linear layers of the Llama models (both attention and FFN layers) including the head and the initial embedding. I set Lora rank to 64, Lora α to 32, and always activate rLora.\n",
        "4. Prepare the dataset for training. The dataset consists of **chunks** of 256 tokens extracted from the Chtulhu Rulebook. More details are provided in the following sections.\n",
        "5. Fine-tune the Lora model. I track the training loss as the main metric. I also track and store VRAM snapshots to monitor the memory usage."

        "# 4. Prepare textual dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "We perform continuous pretraining on the text of the [Chtulhu Rulebook](https://archive.org/details/call-of-cthulhu-core-rulebook-by-chaosium-inc.-z-lib.org). The text (located at `data/output`) is converted from the original PDF (located at `data/pdf`) as described in `1_synt_dataset_generation.ipynb`. The text consists of 466,075 tokens, for a total of 1,690,260 characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The text is then split into **chunks** of 256 tokens. Each chunk constitue a training example. Chunks have a high overlap, in order to ensure that all the semantic content of the Rulebook is considered during training. More details on how chunking is performed are reported below.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, I do the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Load the text of the Rulebook. Since we are doing continued pretraining, we do not need to split into training and test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Tokenize the text [4, 5, 6] and peform **chunking** (see details below). Each chunk constitutes a training example for the Lora model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Initialize the Data Collator that will generate batches during fine-tuning. This is done exactly as in `2_lora_qa_finetuning.ipynb`. \\\\\n",
        " I use the `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` which performs the following for each batch (see [7] for a complete guide):\n",
        " - **Padding**: finds the example in the batch with the longest 'input_ids'  token sequence _n_. Pads the 'input_ids' token sequence of the other examples in the batch up to _n_, using the tokenizer's pad token. This results in all token sequences in the batch to have the same length.\n",
        " - **Labels**: create a new 'label sequence' for each example in the batch. This is the field used by the Trainer to compute the loss. The label sequence is created as follows. First, it copies the token ids from the 'input_ids' sequence into the label sequence. Then, it replaces pad token ids with -100 so that pad tokens are not used for loss computation. \\\\\n",
        "Note that the label for token $u_i$ should be token $u_i+1$ since we want to predict the _next_ token $u_i+1$ from the context $u_0...u_i$. Therefore we we would expect the Data Collator to not simply 'copy' the input_ids into the label sequence, but to shift the label of one position. In Hugging Face this shifting is actualy done by the trainer itself [8], therefore just copying is ok.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How chunking is done\n",
        "\n",
        "I construct the dataset for continuous pretraining with a procedure that is very similar to that used by big LLM players to pretrain fundational model (e.g. GPT or Llama).\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, I take the raw text of the Rulebook, tokenize it, and split it into chunks [15, 16, 17, 18]. Each chunk has a fixed number of tokens (`CONTEXT_LENGTH`, which I set empirically to 256). Each chunk starts a fixed number of tokens after the start of the previous chunk (`STRIDE` which I treat as a hyperparameter). In practice:\n",
        "  - first chunk => start at token index `1`, ends at token `CONTEXT_LENGTH`\n",
        "  - second chunk => start at token index `STRIDE`, ends at token `CONTEXT_LENGTH + STIRED`\n",
        "  - third chunk => start at token index `2*STRIDE`, ends at token `2*STRIDE + CONTEXT_LENGTH`\n",
        "  - k chunk  => start at token index `K*STRIDE`, ends at token `K*STRIDE + CONTEXT_LENGTH`\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that when we use a `STRIDE` of 1, we extract a total of `N-CONTEXT_LENGTH`, chunks, where N is the total number of tokens in the dataset.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "TOKENS = [\"the\", \"book\", \"is\", \"on\", \"the\", \"table\", \"and\", \"is\", \"red\"]\n",
        "CONTEXT_LENGHT = 5\n",
        "STRIDE = 1\n",
        "Chunks are:\n",
        "    [\"the\", \"book\", \"is\", \"on\", \"the\",]\n",
        "    [\"book\", \"is\", \"on\", \"the\", \"table\"]\n",
        "    [\"is\", \"on\", \"the\", \"table\", \"and\"]\n",
        "    [\"on\", \"the\", \"table\", \"and\", \"is\"]\n",
        "    [\"the\", \"table\", \"and\", \"is\", \"red\"]\n",
        "```\n",
        "This allows every token in the dataset to be predicted with full context.\n",
        "For example, if we had instead used `STRIDE=5` we would have had:\n",
        "```\n",
        "    [\"the\", \"book\", \"is\", \"on\", \"the\"]\n",
        "    [\"table\", \"and\", \"is\", \"red\"]\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this case, the token \"table\" would never had a chance to be predicted,since it never has a context. Therefore we want `STRIDE` to be always smaller than `CONTEXT_LENGTH`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Note about Pad token in Llama.\n",
        "\n",
        "`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` requires the Tokenizer to have a pad token, or it fails. Since Llama does not have a pad token, I set it manually to one of the unused 'reserved tokens' (see file tokenizer_config.json in Hugging Face). Specificially I used the aptly named `<|finetune_right_pad_id|>` [10].\n",
        "I could have alternaitely used the `eos_token` or a brand new token, but these have the following disadvantages:\n",
        "-  eos_token: this would result in the collator to 'mask' the eos_token (i.e.\n",
        "set all the occurrences of eos_token, also those that actually mean 'end of sentence') to -100. This may result in the model never to emit eos_token, end therefore endlessly generate [11, 12].\n",
        "- new token: this would change the token vocabulary size. We would therefore need to resize the embedding layers, which is inconvenient and may not work with quantized models [13, 14].\n",
