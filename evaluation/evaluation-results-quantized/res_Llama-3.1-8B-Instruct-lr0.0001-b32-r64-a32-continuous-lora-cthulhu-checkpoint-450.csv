Who wrote the Necronomicon chapter?,Keith Herber,1,"The Necronomicon was written by many authors, as it is a 
compendium of magical and horrific lore. The main sections 
were written by Abdul Al-hazred, an Arab wizard and poet of 
the 12th century. However, the Necronomicon is a translation, 
and the original works must have been far more extensive. 

Abdul Al-hazred was born in Damascus and lived in Yemen 
and Carthage, traveling throughout black Africa as a merchant. 
He was a student of magic, astrology, and the occult, as well 
as a poet and philosopher. He is also known as Al-Hazrad. 

Surviving manuscripts of Al-Hazred’s works include the 
Necronomicon, the Book of Eibon, and the Revelations of Gla'aki. 
He is also mentioned in the Malleus Maleficarum, the Cultes des 
Goules of Comte d'Erlette, and the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of 
Otto von Bismarck (a mistaken identity – see Von Junzt).

What is the role of the Keeper in the Call of Cthulhu?,"The Keeper runs the story, set the scene for the investigators, tells them what they can do and what the effect of their actions is",1,"In Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper is the game moderator, taking the role of 
referee, presenter, and co-player all in one. The Keeper is the game 
moderator, ensuring that the rules are applied fairly and evenly to 
all players, and that the game runs smoothly. The Keeper should 
foster a fun and scary game with atmospheric presentation, and 
above all, be a good listener. 

The Keeper is the host and presenter of the game, and as such 
he or she is in charge of preparing the scenario and running the 
game. The Keeper should have a thorough understanding of the 
rules and be familiar with the materials presented in this book, 
as well as being familiar with his or her players.

Many  roleplaying  games  present  a  conflict  between  the 
Keeper’s  role  as  story  presenter  and  game  moderator.  The 
Keeper is the only game moderator in Call of Cthulhu; the other

What dices are needed to play Call of Cthulhu?,"The following dices are needed: a percentile dice (called D100), a four-sided dice (called D4), a six-sided dice (called D6), an eight-sided dice (called D8), and a twenty-sided die (called D20)",1,"To play Call of Cthulhu, you’ll need the following dice:

1.  Four  six-sided  dice  (D6)  (usually  abbreviated  as  ""D6""  and 
sometimes called ""pips""). Most of the rolling in Call of Cthulhu 
is  done  with  six-sided  dice.  You  can  find  these  in  most  toy 
stores  that  sell  board  games.  Two  of  these  make  a  ""pair""  or 
""pair of tens"". If you have four of these, you have a ""pair of pairs"" 
or ""quarter"". 

1D6 reads ""one D-six"".

2.  One  eight-sided  die  (D8);  used  by  the  Keeper  for  some 
monster attacks, if required.

3.  One  ten-sided  die  (D10);  used  by  the  Keeper  for  some 
monster attacks, if required.

4.  One  percentile  die  (D100);  this  is  usually  a  10-sided  die

How many dices are needed at a minimum to play the game?,5,1,"I'm assuming you are referring to a dice game, likely a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG). The most popular RPGs require at least two people and two dice. 

The game that comes to mind is the classic 1977 game ""Traveller"" by 
Chaosium, however the minimum number of dice required for that 
game is 4 (2 six-sided and 2 percentile dice). 

The  game  with  the  minimum  number  of  dice  is  likely 
to be Call of Cthulhu, also by Chaosium, which requires only 
one six-sided die and one percentile die.

The  game  that  comes  to  mind  for  a  game  using  the 
maximum number of dice would be a home-made or custom 
game, but a good example is the 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu

What are the steps to create an investigator?,"There are five steps to create an investigator, namely: generate characteristics, determine occupation, decide skills and allocate Skill Points, create a backstory, equip the investigator",3,"To create an investigator in the 1920s, follow these steps:

Step 1: Generate Characteristics
Find a dice and roll 3D6 (3 six-sided dice) to generate five 
characteristic values, then multiply each by 5. These are the 
investigator's characteristics (see page 32).

Step 2: Determine Occupation
Choose an occupation (pages 68-69) that fits your idea for 
the investigator. Each occupation has its own list of skills, 
and some occupations require specific skill combinations or 
specific skill values. Some occupations are only suitable to 
certain types of stories and campaigns.

Step 3: Decide Characteristics
All  investigators  have  the  following  characteristics:  APP 
(appearance),  EDU  (education),  IDE  (ideology/beliefs), 
INT (intelligence), POW (power), and DEX (dexterity). 

Other characteristics such as STR, CON, and SIZ are factored 
into the seven ""core"" characteristics. See Characteristics, page 
32, for a full explanation.

Step 4: Decide Occupation Skills and 
Allocate Skill Points

What modifiers should a player apply for a character that is 70 year old?,"The player should add 4 improvement checks for EDU and deduct 40 points among STR, CON or DEX, and reduce APP by 20",3,"In the ""Physical Characteristics"" section of the investigator sheet, there is a ""Damage Bonus and Build"" table. 

Age does not have any effect on damage bonus or build, however it does affect Movement rate (see Speed roll, below).

Movement Rate (MV): 
A  character’s  movement  rate  is  their  MOV,  which  is  their  fig-
ure  on  the  DEX  and  STR  rolls  made  during  investigator  creation. 
There is no adjustment for age in the 7th Edition Investigator 
Handbook;  however,  as  a  rough  guide,  one  might  reduce  MOV 
by  1  for  every  50  points  of  damage  bonus  that  have  been  lost 
during the investigator’s lifetime. Thus a 20-year-old with 3D6 
damage  bonus  would  have  1  point  of  movement  restriction,

How can a player increase weapons skills?,A player can increase weapons skills by spending available Personal Interest or occupational skill points,3,"In the game, weapon skills can be increased through use and practice. When an investigator uses a weapon in a successful attack, the user gains a degree of experience with the weapon. 

There is a good old-fashioned skill called ""Fighting"" that em-
braces  a  wide  variety  of  unarmed  and  simple  weapons.  If  a 
character  is  using  a  more  complex  weapon  (such  as  a  rifle) 
with which they are unfamiliar, they must use the ""Firearms"" 
skill.  If  they  are  using  a  weapon  with  which  they  are  less 
familiar, they may use the ""Fighting"" skill. For example, if an 
investigator were to use an axe (a weapon with which most 
people are not familiar), it would require a ""Fighting (Axe)"" 
skill. If the weapon is one that the investigator is not familiar 
with, they may have to use the ""Fighting (Brawl)"" skill—this

What is the hypnosis skill?,"It is the ability to induce another person in a trancelike state, which allows the person to relax and recall memories that were forgotten. The limits of the skill during the game are decided by the Keeper, for example if the player is able to use the skill on an unwilling target.",4,"The Hypnosis skill is a mental manipulation technique that can be used to influence the actions of another being. It is most commonly used on 
an  individual  who  is  fully  awake  and  aware,  although  it  can  also  be  used  on  a  person  who  is  asleep  or  otherwise  partially  immobile. 

Hypnosis can be used to make people do your bidding, but only for a short time. It is up to the Keeper whether the use of hypnosis 
constitutes a maneuver and if so, if it can be used as a fighting maneuver or a maneuver of its own. Hypnosis might also be used as a 
combat maneuver if the target is being held at gunpoint or otherwise has a strong reason to obey.

Those that are resistant to suggestion, such as the insane, young children or those 
who have an Idea roll (see Ideas and Intuition, page 35), may ignore the hypnosis,

Who decides the difficulty level of a skill roll?,The Keeper,5,"In Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper decides the difficulty level of a skill roll. 

There are three levels of difficulty in Call of Cthulhu: Regular, Hard, and Extreme. 

Regular difficulty level: an average example of what would challenge a competent person. The player needs to roll equal to or below their full skill or characteristic in order to succeed. 

Hard difficulty level: this task would challenge a professional. The player needs to roll equal to or below a half of their skill or characteristic in order to succeed. 

Extreme  difficulty  level:  this  task  would  challenge  an  expert;  it  is  on  the 
border of what is humanly possible. The player needs to roll equal to or 
below a fifth of their skill or characteristic in order to succeed.

If the difficulty level of a task is set to Hard or Extreme and the roll is failed, 
the Keeper may choose to inflict damage or some other form of harm as a 
consequence of failure. This takes the form of one penalty die (for a Hard 
difficulty level) or two penalty dice (for an Extreme difficulty level). This 
rule does not apply to ranged and melee attacks, where the difficulty level 
cannot be pushed",You are a helpful AI assistant.

What happens when a player must use more than one skill?,"The Keeper decides if the player must roll a dice for each skill, or roll the dice only once. In the latter case, player makes only one dice roll and then applies the result to each of the skills",5,"When  a  player  is  attempting  something  that  utilizes  more 
than  one  skill,  the  player  should  use  their  highest  level  of 
success. In the case of an opposed roll, the opponent’s highest 
level of success is used to oppose the player’s highest level of 
success. If the skill or characteristic called for is not listed on 
the investigator sheet, the Keeper should decide whether to allow 
its use or not, depending on the situation and the setting. 

The  Keeper  will  specify  whether  a  difficulty  level  is 
Regular, Hard, or Extreme, and the player will indicate whether 
they have a skill or characteristic that is above the difficulty 
level.  If  the  investigator’s  chosen  skill  or  characteristic 
exceeds  the  difficulty  level  set  by  the  Keeper,  the  player 
deals  the  damage  or  achieves  the  desired  outcome  with  a

What is a Combat Round?,It is a unit of time in which each player can perform at least one action during combat.,6,"In a combat round, all characters and monsters involved in the 
combat get a chance to act. The number of actions that can 
be made is equal to the number of movement actions that the 
character is able to make. 

In 6th Edition, the combat round is not a fixed unit of 
time and should be played dramatically. A combat round is 
a combat round. The duration of a combat is not measured 
in rounds; rather, the Keeper determines when a combat is 
over. The combat will end when the Keeper judges it to be 
so, usually when one side has been defeated. 

Dexterity and the Order of Attack 
The  question  of  who  gets  the  first  opportunity  to  attack 
can be an important issue in a fight. Determine the order 
of attack by ranking the combatants' DEX from highest to 
lowest. In the case of a draw, the side with the higher combat 
skill goes first.

Actions in a Combat Round
On  their  turn  in  the  DEX  order  (highest  to  lowest)  each 
character may use their action:

T  To initiate an attack using the Fighting, Firearms, or 

Throw skills.

In case of draw, the combatant with highest combat skill",6,"In a melee (a fight in a confined or crowded area), characters and monsters that are able to act are arranged in order of their DEX (Speed) from highest to lowest. 

Characters and monsters that are unable to act because they are restrained or physically unable to move are at the end of the order and do not act unless someone fails a pushed Locksmith or Mechanical Repair roll to free them.

On a draw, the character with the highest DEX acts first, followed by those with a lower DEX score. If two characters have the same DEX, the one with the higher STR acts first, and so on for CON, and then INT. 

If two characters are deadlocked for initiative, you can allow both to act in the DEX order round. If there is still a problem, you can use a Luck roll to decide who goes first.

Once the order of combat has been determined, stick with it until everyone has had their turn.

In which situation is a character allowed to escape a close combat?,The character must have no physical restrains and have an escape route,6,"In  a  fight  back  and  forth  between  two  opponents,  either 
combatant may use an attack to hit the other. If there is a third 
participant in the combat, such as a third person arriving to 
join in, this changes the dynamics and creates a fight in which 
more than two people are involved. When two or more charac-
ters are fighting, the rules for combat are resolved one on one. 
The  Keeper  should  rank  the  combatants  according  to  their 
Dodge and Fighting (or Throw, as appropriate) skills from highest 
to lowest and then resolve the combat in order of priority. 

Once the order of attack has been determined, the attacker 
may choose their target from among those that are within range 
and have not yet acted. The attacker gains a bonus die if their 
opponent is dodging. The Keeper should be aware of the range 
between the combatants and make a skill roll difficult when 
characters are shuffling around one another, ceasing to be in 
range of some opponents and coming into range of others.

How is a firearm attack resolved?,A firearm attack is resolved with a 1D100 roll and compare the result with the Firearm skill of the attacking character. The difficulty level of the roll is determined by the range and other factors,6,"In combat, a firearm attack is a skill roll. The roll is 
made against the shooter's Firearms skill. The type of firearm 
used is factored into the difficulty level. 

Firearms are categorized as either Handguns, Rifles, or 
Shotguns, each having different levels of difficulty. The base 
range for each category is written in brackets after the skill. 
The user of the firearm does not need a skill if using it at 
its base range, however for each additional range increment the 
user must make a difficulty level of roll. If the attack is made 
on  the  character’s  own  turn  in  the  order  of  combat,  any 
ranges  over  the  base  range  are  simply  applied  to  the 
difficulty  level.  If  the  attack  is  made  as  a  surprise  or 
on an ally’s turn in the order of combat, the range is not 
factored into the difficulty level.

from such wounds by natural means (see Page 123).

chapter 6: combatEven with the best of medicine, no person can consistently 
regenerate from more than a few hit points of damage per 
day. The only way to regain hit points equal to the character’s 
maximum hit point total is through the use of magic (see Lec-
thanians, page 248, for an exception). 

When the damage from a Major Wound is healed, the Major 
Wound box should be ticked. When all damage has been healed, 
the character recovers consciousness if unconscious, and any dying 
checks are recovered from. 

Recovering from a Major Wound takes at least a week, and 
typically requires a full week of rest in a hospital or other medi-
cal facility. The use of a hospital will speed recovery (see Dying 
and  Recovery,  page  124).  A  Major  Wound  Recovery  roll

Can you provide a short description of how a Chase takes place?,"A chase take place when the participants have an escape route. The Keeper positions the participants, decided the order of play and how many movements each participant can make in each turn. At the beginning each participant makes a CON roll to adjust their MOV rating. Then, at each round of the chase the participants act in DEX order, and move a number of locations based on their MOV rating. In some cases attacks can also be performed. The Keeper can add hazards and barriers to the chase as well.",7,"In a Chase, characters and vehicles are ranked in order of their MOV (Movement Rate). The slowest participant goes first, and the Keeper describes the situation, then each player in turn describes the actions their investigator is taking. 

Once everyone has said what they are doing, the Keeper makes a skill roll for each character, starting with the one with the lowest MOV, to determine who has moved the farthest. 

The process is then repeated until all characters have moved. Characters cannot move twice the distance of the slowest participant; the Keeper will judge each request to move on a case-by-case basis.

Harvey is fleeing from the police. His friend, Rodger, is helping him. There is a market in the way, with people

What is a speed roll used for during a chase?,It is used to adjust the participant MOV rating for the whole duration of the chase,7,"In a chase, speed rolls are used to establish the order in which participants move. 

First, all participants make a speed roll. Speed rolls are CON rolls. 

Once the speed roll is made, list the participants of the chase in speed order, fastest to slowest. 

The slowest participant should go first, as he or she will have the opportunity to make a skill roll first when the chase begins. 

If a character or vehicle is building up speed, they may make one additional movement action before their first attack or maneuver. 

Diving for cover requires a Dodge roll and a character that does so forfeits their next movement action.

Characters  and  vehicles  are  restricted  to  moving  in  a  straight 
line,  unless  they  make  a  maneuver.  A  maneuver  allows  for  a 
character or vehicle to change direction, to brake or to accelerate. 
The number of movement actions that a character or vehicle 
has is equal to its number of movement actions listed in its char-
acteristic  table  (see  page  33).  Most  characters  and  vehicles 
have  one  movement  action  by  default.  Some  have  more, ",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How many movements can a chase participant take per round?,"Each participant can take one movement action per round, plus the difference between his movement rating and the movement rating of the slowest chase participant",7,"In a chase, each participant can move a number of times equal to their MOV rating. The MOV rating of a character or vehicle represents how many meters or yards they can cover with one movement action. 

On  foot,  the  standard  MOV  rating  is  8,  meaning  that  a 
character can move 8 meters with one movement action. If a character has a MOV rating of 9, for example, he or she can move 9 
meters with one movement action, and so on.

In a given round, a character or vehicle can move a number 
of yards or meters equal to its MOV rating multiplied by 10. 
Thus,  a  character  with  MOV  8  can  move  80  yards  in  one 
round. The Keeper should measure the distance in yards or me-
ters, depending on the situation. 

Once a character or vehicle has moved, it must remain where 
it is until its next turn, unless it chooses to move again. If a 
character or vehicle is in a place where it is vulnerable to attack, 
such as being on the floor or in the water, its player may choose 
to move it on a later turn,",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What methods can the Keeper use to create obstacles and hazards during a chase?,"The Keeper can decide using his own imagination, or do that randomly using a 1D100 roll.",7,"When  presenting  a  chase,  you  should  create  a  string  of  such 
obstacles, breaking the chase into sections, each with its own die-
roll. The distance between obstacles is always the same for everyone; 
however, some participants may spend more time covering that dis-
tance than others. The Keeper should track each character’s mov-
ment and position with respect to the hazards.

G  If  the  fleeing  character’s  speed  (MOV)  is  higher  than 
that of the pursuer,  the  pursuer  should  have  at  least  a

location or perhaps 1 location behind, depending on the situ-
ation. If the pursuer’s speed is equal to or less than that of the

How are vehicle damages computed after a collision?,By rolling a 1D6 to compute build damage. A delay of the vehicle can also be computed costing a 1D3 movement action,7,"In 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu, vehicle damage is resolved using a comparison of the build values of the two vehicles involved in a collision. 

If the damage is less than the build of the vehicle that 
inflicted it, the vehicle takes half of the damage it inflicted 
and suffers the other half itself.

If the damage is more than the build of the vehicle that 
inflicted it, the vehicle is wrecked. It may explode, burn, roll 
or suffer some combination thereof. Those within the vehicle 
suffer an additional 1D10 damage.

A vehicle is also damaged when it is used to inflict an 
impaling or piercing injury on another vehicle or on an in-
animate object such as a tree or lamp post. The amount of 
damage is the same as for a similar attack using a natural 
weapon, such as a fist or a knife. If a vehicle is used to inflict

an  investigator  is  completely  insane  and  is  out  of  play  for 
an  extended  period,  during  which  the  player  may  not  take

How is it decided how many hours temporary insanity lasts?,By rolling a 1D10. The results of the roll provides the number of hours of insanity,8,"In Call of Cthulhu, the duration of temporary insanity is 
determined by the player. When going insane, the player 
chooses one, two, or three (rolling 1D3) hours of real time 
over which the investigator loses 1D10 Sanity points.

Alternatively,  the  Keeper  may  decide  on  the  duration 
of  insanity  if  time  is  important  in  the  developing  plot, 
or if you wish to make the situation more dramatic.

Temporary Insanity 
and the Cthulhu Mythos 

If  the  Sanity  point  loss  for  a  particular  spell  or  entity  is 
more  than  one-fifth  of  the  caster’s  current  Sanity  points, 
the caster’s mind is overwhelmed and the temporary insanity 
lasts for 1D10 hours. The effects of the spell or encounter 
with the entity are still present at the end of this period or 
when the caster’s Sanity points are reduced to zero, whiche-
ver  comes  first.  In  addition,  the  caster  must  then  make 
a Sanity roll for the cumulative effect of the spell",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is the best way to recover from Indefinite Insanity?,The best way to recover is through private care or home care,8,"Recovery from indefinite insanity can take a while. 

Recovery from temporary indefinite insanity can happen in one of two ways.

First, the player can choose to have their investigator make 

an Intelligence (INT) roll to regain full mental capacity.

Second,  any  non-player  characters  or  other  players’ 
investigator  helpers  can  make  a  Sanity  roll  to  help  their 
comrade recover. If the Sanity roll is successful, the investigator 
immediately recovers from their insanity. 

If the roll is unsuccessful, the process of recovery begins. 
The  investigator  is  then  treated  as  a  new  patient  and  the 
process of treatment begins anew. This may involve a return to 
the asylum, in which case the player will have to make further 
Sanity rolls for the duration of the investigator’s stay. Alterna-
tively, the investigator might be treated successfully in private, 
in which case the recovery phase is over and the game can pro-
ceed with the player’s next investigator development phase.

Treatment with private institutions and by private practitioners 
may be lacking in some respect, but it is generally available 
and effective enough to justify the use of the “",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How many language skill ticks should be awarded when an investigator conducts a full study of a tome in that language?,One,9,"When  an  investigator  fully  studies  a  tome,  they  should  check 
the  book’s  Mythos  rating  and  increase  their  Cthulhu  Myh-
os  skill  by  the  full  rating.  There  is  no  increase  in  language

Harvey Walters finds a tome in English, and after finish-
ing reading it, his player rolls 87 against Harvey’s Cthulhu 
Mythos knowledge. This is below the book’s Mythos rating 
of  30%,  so  Harvey  gains  no  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  points 
and his player does not add any points to any skills. 

A  week  or  so  later,  Harvey  visits  a  used  bookshop 
and finds an ancient Necronomicon. The shopkeeper, a fraz-

How can a character learn a spell?,"There are three main ways to learn a spell: from a Mythos book, from another player, or from a Mythos entity",9,"In the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, learning a spell can occur in three main ways: 

Reading a Mythos book.

Learning from another person (either a fellow investigator or 
somebody a little too familiar with the Cthulhu Mythos).

Through personal experience (usually encountering a Mythos 
entity or being exposed to Mythos energy).

The investigator is the player’s portal to the world of the game. 
Everything in the game is experienced through the investiga-
tor. The truth is known through the investigator. When some-
one  says  something  the  player  wishes  to  know,  they  should 
ask the question “What?” rather than “Do you know?” Players 
should avoid asking for dice rolls unless their investigators have 
actually  encountered  the  thing  they  wish  to  fight,  as  the 
advice in this chapter is aimed at providing Keepers with advice 
on how to run such encounters. 

Winning the Idea Roll
The Keeper has more freedom to alter the outcome of an idea 
roll than he or she does with a skill roll. If the players have 
identified a clue, they have done their job; it is now up to the 
Keeper",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What type of roll must a player do to cast a spell?,A Hard POW roll,9,"In most cases, to cast a spell the player must make a successful POW roll.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What happens when a spell casting roll fails?,"The caster must pay Magic points, Sanity Points and/or POW, multiplied by 1D6",9,"When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  pushed  and  failed,  the  caster 
should  consider  themselves  fortunate  if  they  are  no  more 
than 5 miles away from the target when the spell fails. If this was 
a spell which affected an individual, the target is harmed rather 
than benefited by the spell. The Keeper should determine the nature 
of  the  harm  (physical  injury,  sanity  loss,  madness,  etc.)  and 
amount (rolling 1D6 and dividing by 10, rounding down, and then 
multiplying by 5). The Keeper should describe some manner in 
which  the  caster  has  somehow  corrupted  or  perverted  the 
original spell. Alternatively, the Keeper may choose a spell which 
is very similar to the one that was cast, but with a significant 
difference (a ‘corrupted version’).

If the roll is fumbled, the caster and any other participants 
suffer 1D10 damage each from the sudden, uncontrolled out-
burst of magical energy. Everyone within 10 yards takes 1D10

What information is advised that the Keeper gives to the players before they create their investigators?,"The date and location of the player scenario, a basic description of the beginning of the scenario, professions suitable for the scenario, and suggestions on how the investigator know each other",10,"Before the players create their investigators, it is advised that the Keeper provides the players with some basic information regarding what sort of game you intend to run. This will give the players the opportunity to create investigators that will 
fit in with the theme of your campaign. 

If your campaign is set in the modern day, the players may be able to 
create investigators who are all in their twenties, all be friends and 
all investigators of the same profession—no problem. However, if 
you are switching from a modern-day setting to a historical one, or 
vice versa, then some care is required. 

When switching from a modern-day setting to a historical one, 
the change will most often be from 0 to 100 years back in time. 
The Keeper may wish to create an Amber Scenario, where the 
investigators are from the present day and are trapped in a situ-
ation where they are forced to deal with the horror of the Cthul-
hu Mythos in a more modern-day setting. This may be the case 
in a particular neighborhood, town, or region where the ancient 
practices and secrets have survived in secret and are still practiced 
today. In such a situation the investigators will have to deal with

What are NPCs?,NPCs are Non-player characters that are controlled by the Keeper,10,"NPC stands for Non-Player Character. An NPC is a term used in 
role-playing games, most commonly in role-playing games of the 
fantasy genre, such as Call of Cthulhu. An NPC is any person 
(or being) in the game who is not a player character. Essentially 
they are the “extras” in a film, a population of people for the 
investigators to interact with. The Keeper can call upon these 
“extras” as and when required. 

The  Keeper  may  be  required  to  figure  the  statistics  for 
some  NPCs  (though  often  their  stats  will  be  provided  in 
published scenarios), as well as decide their motivation and 
role in the scenario. The Keeper may also decide what skills 
the non-player characters understand and are proficient in. 

While  playing,  the  Keeper  will  be  describing  most 
non-player characters and will thus be “in character” and 
speaking “in role” as the Keeper is for non-player characters 
and monsters. As with everything else in the game, you are 
encouraged to use your imagination and describe the char-
acter’s appearance and manner when you",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is an Idea Roll?,"It is a roll that allows players to get a clue, and that decides how they get this clue",10,"In some roleplaying games, especially those in the Horror genre, 
the Idea Roll is used. This is rolled when a player lacks ideas how 
to proceed. An Idea Roll is a 1D100 roll. 

First, the player makes an Idea Roll to see if the investigators 
get a clue. If this is successful, the Keeper provides the players 
with a new clue. If this fails, the players are at a loss for what 
to do and the Keeper can press the advantage that this gives the 
investigators’  adversaries  and  give  the  players  a  strong  hint 
or  clear  direction  on  where  the  game  is  going  next  (note 
the use of the word “strong” here—this is not a guarantee, but 
a likely event). 

If the players have reached a point where they are stuck, the 
Keeper can offer them a “hint” in the form of a “strong rec-
ommendation” that they may wish to follow. This is not a roll, 
but may involve a significant risk for the investigators. 

If the players have a sound reason for not taking the hint, 
the Keeper should not push the issue. The players",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What are the Mythos Tomes,"They are books of arcane wisdom, secret and magic",11,"A  great  question!  In  the  stories  of  H.P.  Lovecraft,  certain 
books  contained  truths  and  secrets  about  the  universe  that 
mankind  was  not  meant  to  know.  These  books,  sometimes 
referred to as tomes of eldritch lore or forbidden knowledge, 
were often described as being written by madmen, sorcerers, 
and  alien  gods.  The  sheer  diversity  of  subjects  and  ideas 
presented in these books can be daunting. 

Keepers  are  encouraged  to  use  these  books  as  a  guide 
in  creating  new  Mythos  entities,  spells,  and  artifacts.  The 
Mythos is organic and protean, and no one—Lovecraft incl-
uded—ever truly owned it.

First Spell: A first spell can be any spell the Keeper wishes, 
but it must be a spell from the standard spells of the same school 
as the tome. The Keeper is encouraged to choose a lesser-known 
spell for the first spell, to maintain mystery and surprise.

Mythos Hardened: Investigators who have 20 or more points 
of Cthulhu Mythos skill are no longer susceptible to the effects 
of mythonium poisoning.

Poisons  requiring  a  roll  for  damage  are  treated  as  a  new 
form of poison. The Keeper should determine the appropriate 
effect and duration of the poison, and whether a Medicine roll 
is allowed to treat it.

The Keeper should add a poison to a monster’s attack if it 
makes sense to do so. Many monsters are capable of injecting, 
seeping, or being eaten by their victims, and many have venom 
in their bites and stings.

Which spell can a cultist use to get in touch with alien races?,The Contact Spell,12,"A cultist is most likely to know the Contact Deity spells, 
which  allow  communication  with  a  deity  or  major  god. 
Contact  spells  can  be  used  to  contact  a  god  or  major 
god  directly,  or  to  contact  a  servant,  messenger,  or  an 
avatar of a god. Contact spells do not require the caster to 
be in physical contact with the deity or the creature contacted. 
The caster must know the deity or the creature contacted.

Contact  spells  do  not  give  the  caster  any  special 
powers or knowledge, but provide a way for a deity or a crea-
ture to contact him or her. A Contact spell may also enable the 
caster to see or talk to a deity or a creature, or to receive infor-
mation from one. A Contact spell cannot harm or affect anyone.
