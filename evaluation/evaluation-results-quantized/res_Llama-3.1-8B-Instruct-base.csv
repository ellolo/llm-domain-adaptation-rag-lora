How is it decided how many hours temporary insanity lasts?,By rolling a 1D10. The results of the roll provides the number of hours of insanity,8,"The concept of temporary insanity, also known as the ""insanity defense,"" is a legal doctrine that allows a defendant to argue that they were not responsible for their actions due to a mental disorder or defect at the time of the crime. The duration of temporary insanity is not strictly defined and can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case.

In the United States, the Model Penal Code, which is a widely adopted code that provides a framework for criminal law, defines the insanity defense as follows:

""A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of a mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.""

The duration of temporary insanity is not explicitly stated in the Model Penal Code, but courts have developed various standards to determine when a defendant's mental state was sufficiently impaired to justify an insanity defense.

Some factors that courts consider when determining the duration of temporary insanity include:

1. **The nature and severity of the mental disorder**: The more severe the disorder, the longer the duration of temporary insanity may be considered.
2. **The defendant's behavior and actions**: If the defendant's behavior was consistent with a mental disorder,",You are a helpful AI assistant.
