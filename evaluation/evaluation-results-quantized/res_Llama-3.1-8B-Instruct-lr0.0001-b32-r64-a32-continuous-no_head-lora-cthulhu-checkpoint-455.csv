Who wrote the Necronomicon chapter?,Keith Herber,1,"The Necronomicon is a fictional book created by H.P. Lovecraft. 
The  preface  was  written  by  Dr.  John  Dee  and  the  forward 
by Theodoras Philetas. The main body of the text is said to be 
the translation of Dr. Marsham (a reference to the real-life Dr. 
John Dee and his translation of the Greek Necronomicon, as well 
as the translation by Dr. Dee’s secretary, the fictional Ludwig 
Prinn, are dropped). The 1673 edition was printed in Cologne, 
Germany, as a folio. 

An English translation, said to be faithful to the original Latin, 
was made by Baron Frederic, a French nobleman, and printed 
in  1597  in  Hamburg,  Germany.  A  copy  of  the  Latin  edition 
is held by the British Museum and another by the Union The-

What is the role of the Keeper in the Call of Cthulhu?,"The Keeper runs the story, set the scene for the investigators, tells them what they can do and what the effect of their actions is",1,"The Keeper is the game moderator, responsible for running the game and ensuring that everyone has an enjoyable experience. 

The Keeper is the final arbiter of the rules and should make judgments about how rules apply to specific situations. 

The Keeper is the main source of information about the mysteries of the story, and is responsible for pacing the revelation of 
information to the players. The Keeper should be familiar with the story of the scenario and be able to adapt it to suit his or her 
players. The Keeper is the game's ""game moderator"" and is also referred to as the “Keeper of the Cthulhu Mythos”.

The Keeper’s role is that of game moderator, arbitrator, and story presenter. You decide the setting, the story, the 
non-player characters, and the course of events. You will also be responsible for the time it takes for events to unfold, and 
for  deciding  whether  the  players’  investigators  succeed  or  fail  at  any  given  time.  In  essence,  you  are  in  control  of  the 
non-player characters and of the world; the players are in control of their investigators.

What dices are needed to play Call of Cthulhu?,"The following dices are needed: a percentile dice (called D100), a four-sided dice (called D4), a six-sided dice (called D6), an eight-sided dice (called D8), and a twenty-sided die (called D20)",1,"To  play  Call  of  Cthulhu,  you  will  need  a  set  of  roleplaying 
dice,  specifically  the  following:  four  six-sided  dice  (D6),  one 
eight-sided  die  (D8),  one  ten-sided  die  (D10),  one  twenty-
sided  die  (D20),  and  a  percentile  die  (D100).  If  you  don’t 
have these, you can substitute with a combination of smaller dice 
and a little math (see following page).

People new to roleplaying may never have seen dice with 
more than six sides. The 4, 8, 10, 12, percent, and double dice 
are not standard table-dice. If you cannot get hold of a dice 
set containing these, use the following substitutions:

Use the d4 (four-sided die): It is the same as a 1D4.
Use two d6 (six-sided dice) rolled and added together for 
a 1D6+1 (or simply use a d8).

How many dices are needed at a minimum to play the game?,5,1,"The  minimum  number  of  players  needed  to  play  is  three:  two 
players  can  play  as  investigator  and  one  can  play  as  the  Keeper. 
In fact, the ideal number of players is four: three investigators and 
one Keeper. With this number, everyone has a say in the game and 
everyone has a character to control. If more players turn up, they 
may be able to play non-player characters. 

Investigators can be played as cooperators or competitors. 

You may wish to begin with a shorter scenario, one that can be 
completed in one session. A published scenario has guidelines 
for experienced investigators, as well as a more difficult level 
for novices. As Keeper, you may wish to start with the diffi-
cult level for your group and adjust it from there. 

If  you  are  new  to  both  roleplaying  and  Call  of  Cthulhu, 
we recommend that you start with a beginner scenario, such as

What are the steps to create an investigator?,"There are five steps to create an investigator, namely: generate characteristics, determine occupation, decide skills and allocate Skill Points, create a backstory, equip the investigator",3,"To create an investigator, follow these steps:

Step 1: Decide on a Theme
Choose a theme for your investigator: 1920s Film Star, Female Disciple of 
Hastur, and so on. Look to Lovecraft’s stories for inspiration or com-
pose your own. Having a theme helps to build a backstory and de-
termine where to position your investigator within the Cthulhu 
Mythos. Your investigator’s occupation should be linked to your 
chosen theme. Your player's choice of theme does not have to be 
purely Lovecraftian—modern-day settings and themes are avail-
able as alternatives or additions.

Step 2: Decide on an Occupation
An  occupation  binds  the  investigator  to  a  particular  field  of 
study or vocation.  Each  occupation  has  a  list  of  skills  and

alty  dice  for  the  2  movement  actions  that  are  lost  due  to 
aging, and a reduction in both STR and DEX by 2D10.

Also,  the  investigator  would  be  reduced  in  the  EDU 
characteristic by 2D10, and their number of personal inter-
ests should be reduced by 2D10 (see Personal Interests page

"Given a specific skill, what is the range of skill points for an investigator at the Amateur level?",between 20% and 49%,4,"In  Call  of  Cthulhu,  each  skill  has  a  range  of  skill 
points  assigned  to  it,  depending  on  its  own  skill  level. 
These ranges indicate the number of skill points that should be 
allocated to the skill during investigator creation. 

The  ranges  are  divided  by  two  skill  levels:  Base  and 
Advanced. As a guide, an investigator with an occupation 
that begins at 50% or over may spend skill points to raise 
one or more of those skills to 50%, and/or 90%, or even 
100%. An occupation that begins at 25% may have skills 
raised to 25% and/or 50%. 

Some  occupations  begin  at  5%.  These  are  often

Who decides the difficulty level of a skill roll?,The Keeper,5,"The difficulty level of a skill roll is set by the Keeper. 

When  the  player  requests  a  skill  roll,  the  Keeper  should 
determine  whether  the  difficulty  level  is  Regular,  Hard,  or 
Extreme. 

Regular difficulty level: an average example of what would 
challenge a competent person in the skill. The player only needs 
to roll equal to or below his or her full skill or characteristic 
in order to succeed.

Hard difficulty level: this task would challenge a profession-
al. The player must roll equal to or below a half of his or her 
skill or characteristic in order to succeed.

Extreme  difficulty  level:  this  task  would  challenge  an  ex-
pert;  it  is  on  the  border  of  what  is  humanly  possible.  The 
player must roll equal to or below a fifth of his or her skill or

the  pushed  roll.  By  and  large  the  consequences  of  a  failed 
pushed roll will be the opposite of those of a successful pushed 
roll.  If  the  goal  of  a  suggested  consequence  of  a  failed  roll 
is not appropriate, you should think up something else that is.

A  pushed  roll  requests  a  re-roll  and  allows  the  player  to 
alter  or  change  some  aspect  of  the  situation  in  the  hope  of

act. This usually means that everyone rolls dice to determine 
what actions their investigator takes. The options for what can 
be rolled are decided by the Keeper and player. 

A  combat  round  does  not  have  to  be  a  second,  but  it 
usually is.  Time  moves  at  the  Keeper’s  discretion,  but  for 
this to be the case the Keeper must be clear about what a round 
represents in the story. A combat round could be 1 minute, but 
it could also be 30 seconds, 10 seconds, or even 1 second—what 
it represents is relative to the story. 

The  duration  of  a  combat  round  should  not  be  set  at

What is a speed roll used for during a chase?,It is used to adjust the participant MOV rating for the whole duration of the chase,7,"In a chase, speed rolls are used to establish the order of 
play and to determine the number of movement actions each

A chase is made up of a string of locations. The number 
of  locations  between  each  participant  is  determined  by 
their  difference  in  MOV  speeds.  Every  10  speed  points 
of  difference  (from  fastest  to  slowest)  equals  one  loca-
tion.  If  there  is  a  gap  of  3  speed  points  between  two

What state of insanity exist in the game?,"There are three states of insanity: temporary, indefinite and permanent.",8,"In the game, there are three distinct states of insanity. 

First is temporary insanity, also known as a bout of madness, which lasts for 1D10 rounds (minutes). During this time the investigator acts as if under the control of their irrational personality. 

Second is indefinite insanity, also known as an insanity attack, which lasts for 1D10 hours. During this time the investigator is completely incapable of action, as if in a trance or under anesthesia. 

Third is permanent insanity, which is inflicted when the Sanity loss for a single event exceeds 5 points. 

Note: in 7th Edition and earlier, the three states of insanity were known as temporary, indefinite, and permanent; 
in  Call  of  Cthulhu  6th  Edition  and  later,  these  have  been  reworded  as  bout  of  madness,  under  the  doctor’s  care, 
and in the care of a sanitarium, respectively. 

Indefinite insanity now lasts until the character is released or until 
they have fully recovered (usually at the Keeper’s discretion, but 
this can be nominal if it is agreed that recovery will take a game 
month, or two game",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How many Sanity points must an investigator loose to become temporary insane?,Five or more,8,"6 points of Sanity loss results in temporary insanity. 

If the Sanity loss is between 17 and 30 points, the investigator is indefinitely insane.

If the Sanity loss is 31 points or more, the investigator is permanently insane. 

In each case, the Keeper should describe the onset of insanity as a turning point in the story, marking a significant event in the investigator’s 
life. A bout of madness should come to an end, the investigator emerging somewhat changed, at a point that seems appropriate to the 
Keeper, but at least 1D10 hours after it began. The Keeper may call for a Sanity roll to test the investigator’s Sanity points after recover-
ing from insanity. If the roll fails, the investigator has lost further Sanity points as a result of the bout of madness. The Keeper may add 
other sanctions as a result of the bout of madness, in common with those for permanent insanity (at the Keeper’s discretion).

How is it decided how many hours temporary insanity lasts?,By rolling a 1D10. The results of the roll provides the number of hours of insanity,8,"In Call of Cthulhu, the duration of temporary insanity is determined by rolling 1D10. This roll may yield one of three results: 
1 or 2 = 1 hour; 3-10 = 24 hours; 11-20 = 1 week; 21-30 = 1 month; 31-40 = 6 months; 41-50 = 1 year; 51-60 = 2 years;

Note that this is an average; as Keeper you have the freedom to adjust the rate of aging as you wish. 

When a character ages 99 points to become an old character (or if age is reduced to zero), the Keeper should consider how to mod-
ify that character. The Keeper may choose to make an “experience check” roll to see how the investigator’s life has played out. A success 
indicates a happy and successful life, with a high Credit Rating",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is the best way to recover from Indefinite Insanity?,The best way to recover is through private care or home care,8,"In Call of Cthulhu, recovery from indefinite insanity takes time and 
care, and three different paths are available to the investigator—private 
care, institutionalization, and self-help. 

Private Care
The best care available is at home or in some friendly place where 
personal attention can be given. This may be the home of a rela-
tive or friend, or even a sanitarium with a private ward. The 
investigator’s living standards determine the standard of such 
places. For the next 1D4 hours (or as the Keeper judges fit) the 
investigator is under the care of doctors and nurses, and has 
no need to make any rolls for food and lodging. 

The  care  provider  makes  a  dice  roll  for  Sanity  point 
recovery  as  per  the  Medic  skill  (if  a  nurse  or  doctor),  or 
Psychology (if a close friend or relative), or Intimacy (if a loved 
one), or Charm (if a sex worker). If the roll fails, the investiga-

How many language skill ticks should be awarded when an investigator conducts a full study of a tome in that language?,One,9,"When  an  investigator  completes  a  full  study  of  a  tome, 
he  or  she  should  increase  their  relevant  language  skill  by  the 
full  study  bonus  listed  in  the  table  on  the  inside  front  cover 
of the tome. 

Alternatively, if the investigator is not a native speaker of the 
language,  they  may  choose  to  increase  their  Own  Language 
skill  (if  the  language  is  part  of  their  own  culture)  or  Other 
Language  (if  the  language  is  not  part  of  their  own  culture)

How can a character learn a spell?,"There are three main ways to learn a spell: from a Mythos book, from another player, or from a Mythos entity",9,"In the Cthulhu Mythos, knowledge of the gods is gained 
through pain, fear, and a willingness to give up your mind 
and soul to the unknowable. 

Finding a tome is only the first step; the owner must also 
learn to tap into the knowledge it contains. This is the func-
tion of the study phase. The study roll is the most important 
roll for spell-crafters and occult scholars, as it determines 
whether the character gains the knowledge contained within a 
tome.

To  study  a  Mythos  tome,  the  investigator  spends  a 
number of hours equal to or less than the book’s POW rating 
perusing the text. The reader must make a Sanity roll (0/1) 
after  each  month  of  study  (see  Self-help  in  the  Skills 
chapter),  and  also  after  every  12  hours  of  actual  reading.

What type of roll must a player do to cast a spell?,A Hard POW roll,9,"In most cases, to cast a spell the player must make a 
Sanity roll (if the spell requires a Sanity point payment) or 
a  POW  roll  (if  it  does  not).  Additional  requirements 
may be set by the Keeper; for example, a roll may be required 
on the cultist’s INT or EDU. 

The  player  should  be  provided  with  a  description 
of the spell’s effect from the spell description. However, the 
actual damage, Sanity loss, or other outcome is determined 
using the rules for spells and magic in the game. 

The  caster  also  rolls  dice  to  determine  the  number 
of  magic  points  expended  and  the  number  of  Sanity 
points  sacrificed,  as  noted  on  the  chart  for  that  parti-
cular spell. The Keeper should emphasize that the caster is 
essentially  sacrificing  Sanity  points  and  magic  points, 
and  that  the  spell  will  not  work  if  sufficient  magic points 
and Sanity points are not expended. 

The Keeper should take care to describe the spell’s effect

What happens when a spell casting roll fails?,"The caster must pay Magic points, Sanity Points and/or POW, multiplied by 1D6",9,"When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  failed,  refer  to  the  Keeper’s 
notebook for the specific spell for what happens next. In general, 
one of the following occurs.

T  The spell does nothing.

T  The spell causes a fumble result (the opposite of the spell’s 
intended effect).

T  The spell causes a random result (the Keeper decides on a 
random effect, possibly related to the theme of the spell, 
and possibly worse than a fumble).

T  The spell causes a fumble result, but rather than the spell 
backfiring, the magic points spent are lost and no effect is 
produced.

If  the  caster  suffers  a  fumble  on  casting  a  spell  that 
involves the loss of hit points (such as Drain Magic Points, 
Wither Limb, or Cause Wound), the Keeper should choose a 
more severe effect. The Keeper can either use the fumble result 
as it stands or roll again and fumble again, using the second 
fumble result.

What are NPCs?,NPCs are Non-player characters that are controlled by the Keeper,10,"NPC stands for Non-Player Character.  In roleplaying games 
an  investigator  (played  by  a  player)  is  usually  the  only 
""player"" character in the game; the rest of the people play statu-
ary characters, collectively known as non-player characters. The 
Keeper (also known as the Keeper of the Rules, or simply the 
person  running  the  game)  uses  these  non-player  charac-
ters to portray everyone in the game world who is not played 
by a player. 

The  non-player  character  can  be  friendly,  neutral  or 
hostile.  The  player  does  not  have  complete  control  over 
non-player characters; the Keeper has control and may have a 
reason for the non-player character to refuse a player’s request 
or  to  act  in  a  way  that  is  contrary  to  the  wishes  of  the

relevant fact or idea, or to decide if their investigator remembers 
something from their backstory or a previously mentioned source. 
The term is used in both Call of Cthulhu and Chaosium’s H.P. 
Lovecraft roleplaying games.

An Idea roll is different from a regular Intelligence roll. An 
Idea  roll  is  more  akin  to  a  Spot  Hidden  or  Listen  roll  in 
that it is a skill roll made by the player (opposed by the Keeper

been learned in the past. An Idea roll is used in place of Spot 
Hidden or Psychology in certain circumstances (at the Keeper’s
