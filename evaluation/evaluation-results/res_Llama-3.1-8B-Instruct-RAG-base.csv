Who wrote the Necronomicon chapter?,Keith Herber,1,"The Necronomicon was written by Abdul Al-Hazred, also known as Abd al-Azrad, an Arab who lived around 700 A.D. in Sanaa, Yemen.","Surviving Copies 

Condemned  and  destroyed  by  the  Church,  only  five  copies 
of  the  Necronomicon  are  known  to  exist  today,  although 
an  unknown  number  of  copies  may  still  be  held  in  private 
collections.  Copies  that  reach  the  open  market  are  usually 
purchased  by  libraries  or  private  collectors.  The  resultant 
increase  in  value  has  driven  the  price  beyond  the  range  of 
most serious students of the occult. Few can afford to obtain 
their own copies of this dark and powerful book, and, given 
the  value  and  fragile  conditions  of  the  existing  copies,  few 
public institutions allow unrestricted access.

Physical Descriptions 

All  known  printed  editions  of  the  Necronomicon  are  fo-
lio-sized.  The  Latin  editions  printed  in  Spain  and  Germany 
measure  18  by  11-1/2  inches  and  contain  802  pages,  one 
leaf being bound in as a tabbed insert. Records suggest that 
the  Greek  version  was  several  pages  longer.  The  type  style 
is  black-letter  gothic  and  numerous  woodcuts  illustrate  the 
text. Bindings, as with all books of this period, are individual, 
reflecting the tastes of the books’ original owners. 

The  Necronomicon  found  in  the  British  Museum  is  in  a 
15th-century leather binding still in fair condition. Printed in 
Germany, the text is in good condition but lamentably lacks 

seven different leaves, each cut away and removed with great 
care.  This  volume  was  among  the  three  libraries  of  books 
bequeathed to the people of England that led to the founding 
of the British Museum in 1753.

Call of CthulhuThe Necronomicon

Every tome has its own history and the Keeper is invited to 
use this entry regarding the Necronomicon as inspiration for 
his or her own stories of other tomes or similar artifacts.

While  more  ancient  works  are  hinted  at,  in  human  lan-
guages it is the Necronomicon that best relates the reach and 
meaning of the Cthulhu Mythos.
==========
History 

The original version of the Necronomicon, known as the Kitab 
Al Azif, was written around 730 A.D. in Damascus by the Arab, 
Abdul Al-Hazred (Abd al-Azrad). A student of magic as well as 
an astronomer, poet, philosopher, and scientist, al-Azrad was 
born around 700 A.D. in Sanaa, Yemen. Before composing his 
great work he spent years visiting the ruins of Babylon, the pits 
of Memphis, and the great southern desert of Arabia.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is the role of the Keeper in the Call of Cthulhu?,"The Keeper runs the story, set the scene for the investigators, tells them what they can do and what the effect of their actions is",1,"The role of the Keeper in the Call of Cthulhu is to run the game for the rest of the players, preparing scenarios, and making the investigators' opposition smart and mean, while also making creative use of the core rule: the skill roll (Document 1, Document 2, Document 4).","Most of the play is a verbal exchange. The Keeper sets the 
scene, describing the environment, the individuals, and en-
counters to the players. The players tell the Keeper what they 
intend their investigators to do. The Keeper then tells them 
whether they can do it and, if not, what happens instead. In 
play the game takes the form of a group conversation with 
many twists and turns and fun on the way.

The game rules use dice to determine if an action suc-
ceeds or fails when a dramatic “conflict” presents itself; for 
example, whether your investigators are able to leap out of 
the way of a giant statue that is about to crash down upon 
their heads! The rules describe how to decide the outcome 
of such conflicts. 

In Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper has the responsibility of 
preparing scenarios and running the game without bias. It 
is  the  Keeper’s  duty  to  make  the  investigators’  opposition 
smart and mean.
==========
An Overview of the Game
The aim of playing Call of Cthulhu is to have fun with your 
friends as you explore and create a Lovecraftian story. One 
player takes the role of game moderator, known as the Keep-
er of Arcane Lore (“Keeper” for short), and his or her role 
within the rules is to run the game for the rest of the players. 
The rest of the players take the part of intrepid Investigators 
of  the  Unknown  (“investigators”),  attempting  to  seek  out, 
understand and eventually confront the horrors, mysteries 
and secrets of the Cthulhu Mythos.
==========
Of course, the rulebook could attempt to list a specific 
rule for every eventuality, but this leads to a game in which 
the rules must constantly be referred to and in which every-
one is restrained by a rule on every action. Call of Cthulhu is 
designed to be flexible and to encourage the Keeper to make 
creative use of the core rule: the skill roll.
==========
Presenting the Authorities
The  Keeper  should  define  the  function  and  purpose  of 
a  given  authority  in  the  context  of  the  scenario.  A  sheriff 
or a judge, for instance, can be a great help or a great ob-
struction to an investigation; perhaps by controlling access 
to evidence, the non-player character may willfully pursue 
personal theories concerning a crime rather than cheerfully 
adopting the ideas of the investigators, and may even blindly 
order the arrest of the investigators as suspects, or hold them 
as material witnesses.

Uniformly portraying authorities as sleazy opportunists, 
corrupt fools, and rigid bumpkins enforces a cliché that can 
corrode the heart of the game. Call of Cthulhu assumes that

the NPC with the investigators and to complicate the inves-
tigator’s lives.

Finally, the information presented is intended first and 
foremost as a skeleton for the Keeper to flesh out as desired, 
adding more detail as he or she wishes—all to make the best

tastes and that of the players.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What dices are needed to play Call of Cthulhu?,"The following dices are needed: a percentile dice (called D100), a four-sided dice (called D4), a six-sided dice (called D6), an eight-sided dice (called D8), and a twenty-sided die (called D20)",1,"According to Document 1, two ""units"" dice of different colors, each numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, are needed to play Call of Cthulhu.","""It will take me several weeks to translate this""

==========
Alternatively  use  two  “units”  dice  of  different  colors,

color  consistently  as  the  tens-digit  and  the  other  as  the 
units-digit: thus a result of 2 and 3 reads as 23, a result of 0 
and 1 reads as 1, and a result of 1 and 0 reads as 10. A result 
of 0 and 0 reads as 100.

Sometimes  a  dice  notation  in  the  rules  or  in  a  scenario  is 
preceded by a number; it tells the reader that more than one 
such  die  should  be  rolled  and  that  their  results  should  be 
added together. For instance, 2D6 means that two 6-sided 
dice  should  be  rolled  and  totalled  (or  roll  a  D6  twice  and 
add the scores together).

Call of CthulhuOptional Rules

Spending Luck
After the player has made a skill roll (using a skill or charac-
teristic),  Luck  points  may  be  spent  to  alter  the  result.  The 
player can use Luck points to alter a roll on a 1-for-1 basis. 
The  points  spent  are  deducted  from  the  investigator’s  Luck 
score, which will reduce the chance of passing a future Luck 
roll. 

Luck points may not be spent on Luck rolls, damage rolls, 
Sanity rolls, or rolls to determine the amount of Sanity points 
lost. A player may spend any amount of Luck points (up to 
their current Luck value) on a roll. A player may only spend 
Luck to alter one of their own dice rolls.

When  a  skill  roll  is  failed,  the  player  has  the  option  to 
push the roll OR spend luck; Luck points may not be spent to 
alter the result of a pushed roll.

Criticals, fumbles, and firearm malfunctions always apply, 

and cannot be bought off with Luck points.
==========
Regular difficulty level: an average example of what would 
challenge a competent person. The player needs to roll equal 
to or below their full skill or characteristic in order to suc-
ceed. This should be used in the vast majority of cases.

Hard difficulty level: this task would challenge a profession-
al. The player needs to roll equal to or below a half of their 
skill or characteristic in order to succeed. This should only 
be used occasionally.

Extreme  difficulty  level:  this  task  would  challenge  an  ex-
pert;  it  is  on  the  border  of  what  is  humanly  possible.  The 

82 

Call of Cthulhuplayer needs to roll equal to or below a fifth of their skill or 
characteristic in order to succeed. This should be reserved 
for extreme situations.

If you, as Keeper, feel that the task is easy then don’t ask 

for a dice roll. Save dice rolls for challenging situations.
==========
204 

Call of CthulhuLuck roll would be generous. Perhaps this is one situation in 
which you could ask for a roll against half the investigator’s 
Luck score. A custom rule might be appropriate if you want 
to simulate the feeling of gambling. You might decide to call 
for  three  Luck  rolls  over  the  course  of  the  evening  at  the 
casino and set out the possible outcomes before rolling. Let 
the player nominate the stakes they are risking. If the player 
wins all three Luck rolls, he or she wins big, multiplying the 
stake by ten. If two out of three are achieved, the player wins 
a little. If one is achieved, the player breaks even. If all three 
are lost, the player ends up deep in debt.

G  Three or four hours in which to play the game.

Roleplaying Dice
As  mentioned,  to  play  this  game  the  Keeper  and  players 
will  need  a  set  of  roleplaying  dice,  including  percentile 
dice (D100), a four-sided die (D4), a six-sided die (D6), an 
eight-sided die (D8), and a twenty-sided die (D20). Ideally, 
to  keep  things  moving  along,  players  and  Keeper  should 
each have their own set of dice. 

People new to roleplaying may never have seen dice with 
more than six sides. A variety of them can be found at most 
hobby  game  stores  and  online—probably  including  the 
place where you bought this book.

The  letter  D  stands  for  the  word  “die”  or  “dice”.  The 
number after the D stands for the range of random numbers 
sought: D8 generates the random numbers 1 through 8, for 
instance, while D100 generates the numbers 1–100.
==========
Alternatively  use  two  “units”  dice  of  different  colors, 
each numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. Read the die of one

Call of CthulhuDice Roll Variations

Sometimes  a  dice  notation  in  the  rules  or  in  a  scenario  is 
preceded by a number; it tells the reader that more than one 
such  die  should  be  rolled  and  that  their  results  should  be

dice  should  be  rolled  and  totalled  (or  roll  a  D6  twice  and 
add the scores together).
==========
The  dice  are  then  rolled,  usually  by  the  Keeper  and  the 
player simultaneously, and the results used to determine what 
maneuvers are achieved and how much damage is inflicted.

How  you  describe  the  outcome  of  the  dice  roll  is  im-
portant  to  your  story,  but  of  no  importance  to  the  game 
mechanics. One Fighting roll which inflicts 6 hit points of 

damage  may  represent  a  few  good  punches,  a  knee  to  the 
groin, a series of kicks or a head-butt—your description of 
the outcome should elaborate upon your stated intention, 
suiting the relative success achieved.

Try to use this format each round: allow each character’s 
actions in the story to suggest what rolls are required, resolve 
the dice rolls, incorporate the outcome of the rolls back into 
the  story,  then  move  onto  the  next  character.  Don’t  just 
repeatedly roll dice without any story.
==========
See Chapter 10: Playing the Game for more advice on 

setting difficulty levels.

Remember, only roll the 
dice if it’s a moment 
of tension. Dice rolls 
are not needed when 
characters undertake 
mundane and everyday 
tasks.

Rolling the 
Dice: Success 
or Failure
There  are  two  possible 
outcomes  of  a  roll: 
success or failure. The 
various  divisions  of 
skill  (fifth,  half,  full)  do 
not equate with graduations of success. The player states a goal 
and then rolls the dice. If the dice roll is equal to or below the 
required number, the goal is fully achieved. If the dice roll is 
below a half or a fifth of the specified skill, the goal will not 
necessarily  be  performed  to  a  higher  standard.  Any  further 
interpretation of the roll is at the discretion of the Keeper.
==========
Equally there’s no need to roll dice for everything. For 
example, each investigator has a Drive Auto skill,  but dice 
don’t need to be rolled every time an investigator gets in a 
car—that would be just dull! If you say your investigator is 
driving to the local historical society, unless someone takes 
issue with you, then it’s done. Simply move on with the sto-
ry. Normal day-to-day stuff that everyone ""just does"" should 
be just that—no dice needed.",You are a helpful AI assistant.

Lovecraft  died  in  near  obscurity  in  March  of  1937, 
at the age of 46, a victim of Bright’s disease and virulent 
cancer.  His  mother  had  died  in  1921  after  two  years’ 
confinement  in  the  same  institution  where  his  father 
had  died.  A  brief,  two-year  marriage  accompanied  by 
residence in New York proved disastrous, though divorce 
was never made final, and in 1926 Lovecraft had returned 
home to Providence to live out his years a bachelor, shar-
ing quarters with two aunts.

it was during this period that he produced some of his 
most  memorable  tales.  He  also  found  time  to  travel, 
visiting places that tickled his antiquarian heart: Maine, 
Philadelphia, Quebec, St. Augustine, Charlotte, New Or-
leans,  Salem,  and  Nantucket.  Traveling  by  bus,  sleeping 
in  YMCAs,  eating  crackers,  cheese,  and  canned  beans, 
Lovecraft was able to indulge his personal tastes for trav-

Pre-Generated Investigators
You can create the investigators before play and then distrib-
ute them among the players. This approach works well for 
games where play is restricted to a set time slot, such as at a 
gaming convention.

 Try to remember the following factors when designing 

investigators for other people:

Archetypes  are  quickly  accessible:  The  grizzled  ex-cop, 
curious reporter, etc.
==========
Creating your own investigator 
from scratch is great fun. 
The rules detail rolling your 
investigator’s statistics, 
choosing an occupation and 
skills and developing a personal 
history. When beginning a game 
of Call of Cthulhu, it is 
recommended that all the players 
‘roll-up’ their investigators 
together in the company of the 
person who will be taking on 
the role of Keeper—this ensures 
that everyone helps to ‘form’ 
the group, with each investigator 
taking an agreed role, ensuring 
that a balance of skills and 
occupations is found.
==========
—H. P. Lovecraft, The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward

Most of the ideas and abilities that make an investigator inter-
esting and fun to play are a matter of choice—not necessarily 
dice roll results. Think about what personal history, friends, 
enemies, and achievements could have led your investigator

There are ten categories listed on the back of the investigator

al Description, Ideology/Beliefs, Significant People, Meaningful 
Locations,  Treasured  Possessions,  and  Traits).  It’s  not  essential 
to have an entry for each category, but the more you are able to 
define, the more your investigator comes to life. Further entries 
may be added or existing ones altered during play.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What modifiers should a player apply for a character that is 70 year old?,"The player should add 4 improvement checks for EDU and deduct 40 points among STR, CON or DEX, and reduce APP by 20",3,"For a 70-year-old character, the player should deduct 80 points among STR, CON, or DEX (Document 3).","Aging
There  are  various  modifiers  applied  during  investigator 
creation to reflect the investigator’s age. In the rare instances 
that  an  investigator  ages  significantly  in  play,  modifiers 
should be applied to reflect the change in age. This is unlike-
ly to be a factor in many games, but may come in to play in a 
campaign, or when jumping decades and picking up an in-
vestigator’s story later in life. Aging may also occur suddenly 
as a result of a spell or magical gate; such aging may inflict 
the negative physical effects without the gain in education.
The  aging  effects  are  cumulative,  so  if  ageing  two  de-
cades  from  thirties  to  fifties,  apply  modifiers  for  turning 
both forty and fifty.

Turning 20: Make an improvement check for EDU. Add 5 
points among STR and SIZ.

Turning 40: Make an improvement check for EDU. Deduct 
5 points among STR, CON or DEX, and reduce APP by 5.

Luck
When creating an investigator roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 
for a Luck score. See Chapter 5: Game System for how Luck 
is used.

Age
A  player  can  choose  any  age  between  15  and  90  for  their 
investigator.  If  you  wish  to  create  an  investigator  outside 
this age range, it is up to the Keeper to adjudicate. Use the 
appropriate  modifiers  for  your  chosen  age  only  (they  are 
not cumulative).

G  15  to  19  years  old:  Deduct  5  points  among  STR 
and SIZ. Deduct 5 points from EDU. Roll twice to 
generate a Luck score (see Luck, above) and use the 
higher value.

Harvey  plays  a  few  1920s  stories,  after  which  the 
Keeper wishes to play a scenario set in the 1930s. This 
finds Harvey 10 years older (now aged 52) and so the 
aging effects are applied. A dice roll of 98 grants Harvey 
1D10 improvement to his EDU, adding 9 points for an 
EDU  of  93.  The  player  then  reduces  Harvey’s  CON 
and APP by 5 points each. Harvey is still a handsome 
fellow (APP 75). His hit points are decreased by 1 to 14 
as a result of his drop in Constitution. His MOV drops 
from 6 to 5, he’s not as fast as he used to be, but all in 
all, Harvey is aging pretty well!

How can a player increase weapons skills?,A player can increase weapons skills by spending available Personal Interest or occupational skill points,3,"According to the context, a player can increase weapons skills in the following ways:

1. Spending skill points to purchase any skill specialization (Document 1 and Document 3).
2. Using personal interest skill points for Fighting and Firearms (Document 2).
3. Using the skills listed in Table XVII: Weapons (pages 401-405) as a reference to determine the damage done by an improvised weapon (Document 4).","Whip (05%): bolas and whips.

Note: Thrown knives use the Throw skill.

Weapons  and  their  skill  categories  are  listed  in  Table 
XVII: Weapons (pages 401-405). The above specializations 
may  not  cover  all  weapons,  but  where  possible  try  to  fit 
other weapons into one of the above categories. Chainsaw is 
included as a weapon because of its use in numerous films, 
but players should note that the chance of a fumble is dou-
bled and that they risk killing their investigator (or losing a 
limb) should this happen.

Firearms (Specializations) (varies %)
Covers all manner of firearms, as well as bows and crossbows. 
You  may  spend  skill  points  to  purchase  any  skill  special-

==========
Note: as a combat skill, this cannot be pushed.

Firearms specializations:

Bow (15%): use of bows and crossbows, ranging from medi-
eval longbows to modern, high-powered compound bows. 

Handgun (20%): use for all pistol-like firearms when firing 
discrete  shots.  For  machine  pistols  (MAC-11,  Uzi  pistol, 
etc.)  in  Modern  era  games,  use  the  Submachine  Gun  skill 
when firing bursts. 

Heavy Weapons (10%): use for grenade launchers, anti-tank 
rockets, etc.

Axe (15%): use this skill for larger wood axes. A small hatch-
et can be used with the basic brawling skill. If thrown, use 
Throw skill.

Flamethrower  (10%):  weapons  projecting  a  stream  of  ig-
nited flammable liquid or gas. May either be carried by the 
operator or mounted on a vehicle.

Call of CthulhuMachine  Gun  (10%):  weapons  firing  bursts  from  a  bipod 
or tripod mounted weapon. If single shots are fired from a 
bipod, use Rifle skill. The differences between assault rifle, 
submachine gun and light machine gun are tenuous today. 

Rifle/Shotgun  (25%):  with  this  skill  any  type  of  rifle 
(whether  lever-action,  bolt-action  or  semi-automatic)  or 
scatter-gun  can  be  fired.  Since  the  load  from  a  shotgun 
expands in a spreading pattern, the user’s chance to hit does 
not decrease with range, but the damage dealt does. When 
an  assault  rifle  fires  a  single  shot  (or  multiple  singles)  use 
this skill. 

Submachine  Gun  (15%):  use  this  skill  when  firing  any 
machine pistol or submachine gun; also for assault rifles set 
on burst.

Old  Man  Birch  has  the  choice  of  picking  up  a  knife 
or a sword. With the knife, he would use his Fighting 
(Brawl) skill of 40%. A sword is trickier to use and has 
its own skill, which is not part of the Fighting (Brawl) 
skill.  Old  Man  Birch  doesn’t  have  any  skill  with  a 
sword, so would have to use it at the base skill value: 
Fighting (Sword) 20%.

Improvised Weapons
All  sorts  of  items  can  be  used  to  inflict  physical  harm: 
snooker cues, scissors, bottles, rocks and so on. Even a gram-
ophone player could be smashed over the back of someone’s 
head for a nasty injury. 

The  Keeper  should  determine  the  damage  done  by  an 
improvised  weapon  by  using  a  comparable  item  on  Table 
XVII: Weapons (pages 401-405). If the improvised weapon 
is similar to a basic melee weapon, such as a knife or club, it 
may be used with the Fighting (Brawl) skill. If it is not, the 
Keeper should decide on which Fighting skill specialization 
is appropriate.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
"Given a specific skill, what is the range of skill points for an investigator at the Amateur level?",between 20% and 49%,4,"According to Document 2, the Amateur level corresponds to a skill range of 20%–49%.","Skill percentiles are not proportions of what is hypothet-
ically  knowable.  If  they  were  able  to  stack  their  respective 
knowledge on a table like poker chips and measure the dif-
ference, a physicist of 60% in the modern day knows much 
more than a physicist of 90% skill in 1910. 

Equally, some skills would be affected by location. A Jap-
anese investigator might have a Law skill of 75% in Japan; 
however if the same investigator were tested on Spanish law 
then the Keeper would probably increase the level of diffi-
culty of the roll.

A skill level of 50% is high enough to let a character eke 
out a living from it. If an investigator rises high in a skill un-
related to their profession, player and Keeper could confer 
about changing the investigator to a new profession.

Personal Interests 
Investigators also draw upon experience, skills, and knowl-
edge  gained  from  hobbies  and  other  non-professional  ac-
tivities, called personal interests. Multiply the investigator’s 
INT × 2 and allot the points to any skills (which can include 
adding further points to occupation skills), except Cthulhu 
Mythos (unless otherwise agreed with the Keeper). 

Write down the total points for each skill on the investigator 
sheet (the points you’ve allocated plus the base chance printed 
on the investigator sheet). The sheet also has space to write in 
the half and fifth values for each skill, allowing you to reference 
them quickly in the middle of a game. A Quick Reference Chart 
for half and fifth values can be found on page 49.

06%–19%:  Neophyte:  beginner  with  a  small 
amount of knowledge.

20%–49%: Amateur: possesses some talent or rudi-
mentary training (hobby level).

50%–74%:  Professional:  allows  a  character  to  eke 
out a living from the skill. Equivalent to a bachelor’s 
degree in a specific subject.

75%–89%:  Expert:  advanced  expertise.  Corre-
sponds with a master’s degree or Ph.D.

90%+: Master: among the world’s best in the skill.

In the case of Art and Craft, Science, and Survival, these skills 
encompass  a  wide  diversity  of  specializations.  The  Keeper 
must decide on the applicability of a particular specialization 
to the situation in hand. Depending on the specific situation, 
the Keeper may allow the use of an alternate specialization at 
an increased level of difficulty if the Keeper agrees that there 
is sufficient overlap with that specialization.

What is the hypnosis skill?,"It is the ability to induce another person in a trancelike state, which allows the person to relax and recall memories that were forgotten.

The user is able to induce a trancelike state in a willing target 
who  experiences  heightened  suggestibility,  relaxation,  and 
possible  recall  of  forgotten  memories.  The  limits  of  hyp-
notism should be decided by the Keeper to fit their game; 
it  may  be  that  only  willing  subjects  can  be  hypnotized,  or 
the Keeper may allow it to be used on unwilling targets in a 
more aggressive manner.

This  skill  may  be  utilized  as  hypnotherapy  on  those 
suffering  mental  trauma,  reducing  the  effects  of  a  phobia 
or mania in a patient (successful use means that the patient 
overcomes the phobia or mania on one occasion). Note that

Fast Talk is specifically limited to verbal trickery, deception, 
and misdirection, such as bamboozling a bouncer to let you 
inside a club, getting someone to sign a form they haven’t 
read,  making  a  policeman  look  the  other  way,  and  so  on. 
The skill is opposed by Psychology or Fast Talk. After a brief 
period  (usually  after  the  fast  talker  has  left  the  scene)  the 
target will realize that they have been conned. The effect of 
Fast Talk is always temporary, though it will last longer if a 
higher level of success is achieved.

Fast Talk may be used to haggle the price of an item or 
service down. If successful, the seller momentarily thinks that 
they  have  struck  a  good  deal;  however,  if  the  buyer  returns 
and attempts to purchase another item, the seller may refuse 
further haggling and even increase the price in order to re-
coup what they lost on the previous sale!

When an investigator makes a skill roll versus a non-play-

level for the player is Regular, Hard, or Extreme. To do this, 
consider the skill or characteristic being used in opposition 
by  the  non-player  character.  As  Keeper,  you  should  make 
a swift and arbitrary decision whether a particular skill or 
characteristic is a key aspect of that character’s profession. 
If the skill or characteristic directly relates to the non-player 
character’s  profession,  then  it  would  be  rated  at  50%  or 
higher, and thus the difficulty level should be Hard. If this

Regular difficulty level: an average example of what would 
challenge a competent person. The player needs to roll equal 
to or below their full skill or characteristic in order to suc-
ceed. This should be used in the vast majority of cases.

Hard difficulty level: this task would challenge a profession-
al. The player needs to roll equal to or below a half of their 
skill or characteristic in order to succeed. This should only 
be used occasionally.

Extreme  difficulty  level:  this  task  would  challenge  an  ex-
pert;  it  is  on  the  border  of  what  is  humanly  possible.  The

What are the consequences of a successful Pushed Roll?,"The goal of the player are achieved as it would have been with the original role, without further consequences",5,"The context does not explicitly state the consequences of a successful Pushed Roll. However, it does mention that the goal of a Pushed Roll is to make the goal achievable, and that the skill and difficulty level may be modified if the situation changes.","It is important to note that a pushed roll is not simply a 
re-roll; time always passes between rolls—it may be seconds 
or hours. 

When  making  a  pushed  roll,  the  goal  must  still  be 
achievable.  The  skill  and  difficulty  level  normally  remain 
unchanged, but may be modified if the situation changes.

==========
Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll:  the  target 
takes  great  offence  and  refuses  to  have  any  more  to  do 
with  you;  your  bribe  worked  and  the  target  signed  the 
forms—however in the cold light of morning they feel they 
have  been  duped,  and  now  their  solicitor  has  employed  a 
private eye to find out what you’re up to, or is suing you for 
malpractice; the target doesn’t like your big talk and, from 
out of nowhere, they pull a knife on you; you persuaded the 
security guard to turn a blind eye to your robbery—however 
they lose their job and, wracked with guilt, they commit sui-
cide (the full implications of your actions hit you and you 
lose Sanity for causing the death of an innocent).

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, they may be 
found later on a street corner trying to convince passersby 
of their argument or bizarre point of view.
==========
Pushing  examples:  Delaying  and  taking  time  to  assess 
the  jump;  throwing  all  your  weight  and  force  behind  the 
jump—really stretching for it. In some instances a Pushed 
roll is not possible; if one leaps across an abyss one cannot 
have a second attempt. However, if one is trapped in a pit 
and jumping to escape, one could have any number of at-
tempts,  which  would  then  be  summarized  by  one  Pushed 
skill roll.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  fall  and 
suffer physical harm; achieve the jump but a valuable pos-
session (of the Keeper’s choice) is dropped in the process.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she will 

become convinced that they can fly.
==========
The  consequence  should  be  more  than  failure.  Every 
time a player loses a pushed roll, you should try to steer the 
game  towards  the  theme  of  horror.  This  may  not  always 
be possible, but have that as your goal: a pushed roll is your 
chance to push the horror.

==========
Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the current 
pulls you under and you lose consciousness, awaking on an 
unknown  beach;  you  are  pulled  under  and  are  injured  by 
being dashed against rocks; you strive for the lifeboat and, 
just as you make it, you feel something cold and slimy grab 
your ankle.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
keeps  on  swimming  and  probably  considers  dry  ground 
dangerous for some reason.

The Keeper will specify whether a success is required for both skills or if only one of the skills needs to be successful.","Specific  situations  that  arise  in  your  game  will  require 
the Keeper to make judgments about how to apply the rules 
regarding  skill  use.  Some  suggestions  on  how  to  use  the 
skills  in  specific  circumstances  are  given  under  individual 
skills. This use of suggestions is to encourage the Keeper to 
make judgments rather than referring to a host of spot rules.
Certain skills embody a wide range of knowledge, such 
as Art and Craft, Fighting, Firearms, and Science, allowing

If the cultist is a key non-player character (with 
STR 80 and SIZ 65), the Keeper may feel that it would 
be more fun to have both sides make an opposed roll. 
Harvey  rolls  57  against  his  SIZ  of  80,  giving  him  a 
Regular success. The Keeper rolls 15, which is an Ex-
treme success for the cultist’s STR. Harvey is knocked 
back, with no chance of pushing the roll.

Combined Skill Rolls
Some situations allow or demand the use of more than one 
skill. Only one dice roll is made, and the result then com-
pared with each of the skills named. The Keeper will specify 
whether a success is required for both skills (i.e. the roll is a 
success when measured against each of the skills) or if only 
one of the skills need be successful.

Note  the  importance  of  using  a  single  dice  roll  in  the

In  some  situations  the  Keeper  may  ask  for  a  roll  against 
more than one skill. Only one dice roll is made; the result 
is then compared with each of the skills named. The Keeper 
will specify whether a success is required for both skills or if 
only one of the skills need be successful.

A deranged cultist suddenly draws a gun on Harvey. 
The  Keeper  asks  for  either  a  Spot  Hidden  roll  or  a 
Psychology roll from Harvey. A success on either will 
allow Harvey to anticipate the attacker’s action, and 
perhaps give Harvey a chance to act first. A successful 
Spot  Hidden  would  allow  him  to  see  the  gun  being 
drawn  by  the  cultist,  while  a  successful  Psychology 
would allow Harvey to anticipate the cultist’s aggres-
sive intent.

cluded for how long a person can survive without food and 
water or how long it takes to hack into a computer network. 
These things can be decided by the Keeper as appropriate to 
the current scenario, using the standard rules and personal 
judgment.  However,  if  one  of  these  is  a  key  element  in  a 
particular  scenario,  then  it  might  be  appropriate  to  come 
up with custom rules that specifically focus on that aspect. 
When making a custom rule, try to keep it simple—focus 
on one skill or a limited number of skills (or characteristics) 
and decide on a method of tracking degrees of success. Try 
to  build  in  meaningful  decisions  that  can  be  taken  by  the 
players; such things might alter the difficulty level or change 
which skill is used.
==========
Spot Rules: Optional 
Rules for Combat

The  main  combat  chapter  contains  all  the  rules  you  will 
need to run fight scenes in your game and you are advised 
to stick with these until you become accustomed to them. 

What follows are a collection of optional rules from which 
you can mix and match as you please. You are not compelled 
to use them just because they are here. Some people prefer 
to  make  spontaneous  judgments  about  each  new  situation 
based  on  its  unique  merits,  while  others  prefer  to  have  a 
strongly defined set of rules to play by. You and your group 
should decide which you prefer.

Rolling for Initiative
If  you  prefer  more  variation  in  combat,  ask  everyone  to 
make  a  DEX  roll  to  determine  the  initiative  order.  Those 
who rolled an Extreme success will be first to act, followed 
by those who rolled a Hard success, then those with a Regu-
lar success, and finally those who failed the roll.
==========
Of course, the rulebook could attempt to list a specific 
rule for every eventuality, but this leads to a game in which 
the rules must constantly be referred to and in which every-
one is restrained by a rule on every action. Call of Cthulhu is 
designed to be flexible and to encourage the Keeper to make 
creative use of the core rule: the skill roll.

Obscure Clue: The Keeper may decide 
to withhold a clue if the players fail their

that  a  clue  is  essential  and  will  simply 
deliver it to a player (see page 202).

Call of CthulhuOptional Rules

Spending Luck
After the player has made a skill roll (using a skill or charac-
teristic),  Luck  points  may  be  spent  to  alter  the  result.  The 
player can use Luck points to alter a roll on a 1-for-1 basis. 
The  points  spent  are  deducted  from  the  investigator’s  Luck 
score, which will reduce the chance of passing a future Luck 
roll. 

Luck points may not be spent on Luck rolls, damage rolls, 
Sanity rolls, or rolls to determine the amount of Sanity points 
lost. A player may spend any amount of Luck points (up to 
their current Luck value) on a roll. A player may only spend 
Luck to alter one of their own dice rolls.

When  a  skill  roll  is  failed,  the  player  has  the  option  to 
push the roll OR spend luck; Luck points may not be spent to 
alter the result of a pushed roll.

Criticals, fumbles, and firearm malfunctions always apply, 

and cannot be bought off with Luck points.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is a Combat Round?,It is a unit of time in which each player can perform at least one action during combat.,6,A combat round is a deliberately elastic unit of time in which everyone wishing to act and capable of doing so has a chance to complete at least one action (Document 0).,"The Combat Round
It is confusing for everyone when multiple players act and 
speak  at  once,  so  to  maintain  order,  combat  is  structured 
into rounds, with each player taking one turn in each round. 
A  combat  round  is  a  deliberately  elastic  unit  of  time  in 
which everyone wishing to act and capable of doing so has 
a  chance  to  complete  at  least  one  action.  An  investigator’s 
equality  of  opportunity  is  much  more  important  than  the 
notion that a combat round must represent a precise amount 
of real-world time. When every investigator and other Keep-
er-controlled characters have had an opportunity to act, that 
combat round is over and the next round can begin.
==========
Movement During Combat
Combat  is  usually  described  narratively,  so  the  distance 
between combatants is rarely measured precisely. It is more 
often  expressed  in  approximate  and  subjective  terms  such 
as ""arm’s reach,"" ""close,"" ""across the room,"" ""away down the 
alley,"" etc. If it seems that distance should be an issue in a 
particular fight, the following rules should be used.

The  maximum  distance  a  character  can  move  in  one 
combat round is equal to their MOV rating multiplied by 
5, in yards. 

In the case of melee attacks, the attacker must get into 

melee range before attacking. 

T  A  character  can  move  a  number  of  yards  equal  to 

their MOV rate and attack normally.

T  If the attacker moves up to their MOV rate multi-
plied by 5, they may make one melee attack at the 
end of the round.

In the case of firearms, shots can be taken by a moving 

character at any time in the round.

G  Firing into melee: one penalty die.

Aiming: Must be declared on the character’s turn in the order 
of combat. The shot is taken on the same turn in the order of 
combat on the following round. If the aiming character takes 
damage or moves while aiming, the advantage of aiming is lost. 

Firing  into  melee  combat:  A  fumble  indicates  an  ally  has 
been hit. If multiple allies are in the line of fire, the one with 
the lowest Luck score is hit.

Movement
All  distances  are  approximate  and  based  on  narrative 
description,  so  accurate  measurement  will  rarely  be  an 
issue. Should you wish to gauge distances then, as a rough 
guide,  a  character  can  cautiously  travel  one  meter  or  yard 
per movement point (MOV) in one combat round; thus an 
average human can travel 8 meters in one combat round. If 
sprinting, a character might cover five times that distance, 
but would soon tire.",You are a helpful AI assistant.

The Keeper may inflict damage on those engaged 
in a maneuver if it is appropriate to the events in the 
story—clearly  someone  falling  from  a  second  story 
window is going to take damage unless they land in a 
safety net or similar.

Striking the First Blow (Surprise)
Something must happen to start a combat; someone 
must strike the first blow. Opponents may square up 
to  each  other  like  two  boxers  in  the  ring,  knowing 
they are engaged in a fight even before the first punch 
is thrown. If this is the case, the Keeper should start 
a combat round. 

Alternatively the attack may be a complete sur-
prise;  a  sudden  knee  to  the  groin  or  punch  to  the 
jaw, for example. When someone states that they are 
making  a  sudden,  unexpected  attack,  they  should

6. Determine who was successful. 

a)  Attacking  a  target  that  is  fighting  back:  The  side  with 
the  better  level  of  success  avoids  being  harmed,  and  inflicts 
damage on the opponent. In a draw the character initiating the 
attack beats the character that is fighting back. If both fail, no 
damage is inflicted.

b) Attacking a target that is dodging: If the attacker gains a 
higher level of success, the attack is successful and the attacker 
inflicts  damage  on  the  loser.  Otherwise  the  attack  is  dodged 
and no damage is dealt. In a draw the character dodging wins 
and evades the attack. If both fail, no damage is inflicted.

Combat rolls cannot be pushed.

7.  Roll  damage  for  successful  attacks  (see  Table  XVII: 
Weapons, page 401-406, or 1D3 for unarmed human attack).

Resolving a Fighting Attack Made 
Against a Target That is Fighting Back
Both sides roll percentile dice and compare the results with 
their  own  Fighting  skill.  The  side  with  the  better  level  of 
success avoids being harmed, and inflicts damage on their 
opponent (see Determining Damage, nearby). If both sides 
achieve  the  same  level  of  success,  the  character  initiating 
the attack hits the character that is fighting back, inflicting 
damage. 

T  If the attacker achieves a higher level of success, they 

deal damage to their target.
==========
If  more  than  one  character  achieves  the  same  level  of 
success, give priority to those with the higher DEX value. If 
characters are still tied, use combat skill value to prioritize. 
Those  that  roll  01  (critical)  on  their  DEX  roll  should 
gain a tactical advantage or bonus die on their first attack. 
Those that roll a fumble should forgo their first attack, per-
haps dropping their weapon or tripping.

Once the initiative order has been determined, stick with 

it for the duration of that combat.

Note  down  each  combatant  in  order,  along  with  their 
level of success (for example ""Brian, Fail""). That way if ad-
ditional combatants join, they can make a DEX roll and be 
placed in the existing initiative order. This will also be useful 
if characters draw guns, as this will affect the timing of their 
action in the combat round.",You are a helpful AI assistant.

Tracking Damage
The number of hit points of damage inflicted by an attack 
can  be  used  to  differentiate  between  regular  damage  and 
major  wounds.  Someone  beaten  unconscious  by  punches 
(each  doing  a  small  amount  of  damage)  may  awaken  the 
next  day  battered  and  bruised  but  able  to  act.  However, 
someone  who  takes  the  same  total  amount  of  harm  in  a 
single attack, such as a gunshot, might be out of action for 
a week or more before the slow healing process even begins. 
A  punch  is  likely  to  result  in  regular  damage,  whereas  a 
gunshot is more likely to inflict a major wound.

If the damage from a single attack is:
T  Less than half the character’s maximum hit points, 

it is regular damage.

T  Equal to or more than half the character’s maximum 

hit points, it is a Major Wound.

permanent limp, blindness in one eye, missing fingers, loss 
of a limb, scarred face, etc.) and make an entry in the inves-

In  another  incident,  Harvey  (who  has  a  total  of 
15  hit  points)  takes  4  damage,  then  6,  then  7.  He 
has taken a total of 17 damage, but as negative hit 
points  are  not  recorded  his  current  hit  points  now 
equal zero. He has only taken regular damage (none 
of the attacks, in themselves, cost more than half of

covers one hit point per day and is back to full health

are reduced to zero.

damage in a single attack), he is now dying; his play-
er checks the “dying” box and marks hit points as “0”. 
The following round a companion attempts First Aid 
and fails. Harvey’s CON roll is successful and he sur-
vives another round. The companion attempts First 
Aid again, this time he is successful. Harvey gains 1 
hit point and is stabilized (only requiring a CON roll 
per  hour)  and  is  taken  quickly  to  a  hospital  where 
he receives professional medical assistance. The dying 
tick is removed and Harvey gains 2 hit points (1D3 
from Medicine skill roll). After a week of rest Harvey 
makes a recovery roll (see below).",You are a helpful AI assistant.
Can you provide a short description of how a Chase takes place?,"A chase take place when the participants have an escape route. The Keeper positions the participants, decided the order of play and how many movements each participant can make in each turn. At the beginning each participant makes a CON roll to adjust their MOV rating. Then, at each round of the chase the participants act in DEX order, and move a number of locations based on their MOV rating. In some cases attacks can also be performed. The Keeper can add hazards and barriers to the chase as well.",7,"A chase takes place in rounds, with the Keeper describing the situation and the investigator determining their actions for that round. The Keeper then determines the required dice rolls and incorporates the outcome into the story, changing the situation for the next player.","A chase is made up of a string of locations. The Keeper 
should  keep  careful  track  of  which  character  is  at  which 
location.  Depending  on  their  speed,  characters  may  move 
1 or more locations each round. Hazards and barriers (see 
following) are positioned between locations and may slow a 
character’s progress. 

Harvey flees from the farmer.

Keeping Track of the Chase
When  running  a  chase  scene  you  may  find  the  following 
method useful for tracking the various characters.

Take a blank sheet of paper or whiteboard. Draw a line 
of dots half an inch apart. Each dot represents one location. 
Label  the  first  dot  with  a  letter  representing  the  pursuer. 
Then  write  a  letter  for  the  fleeing  character  two  dots  on 
from the pursuer, depending on the opening range (see Cut 
to  the  Chase).  As  characters  move,  simply  cross  out  their 
marker and draw it on its new position.

Summary: Five Steps to 
Setting Up a Chase
To sum up, there are five steps for the Keeper to 
perform when setting up a chase:

G  Place the pursuer.
G  Place the fleeing character.
G  Position hazards and barriers.
G  Allocate  each  participant  a  number  of  move-

ment actions.
G  Determine DEX order.
==========
Locations
""Location"" is a term used to denote a position in the chase. 
The  locations  do  not  need  to  be  equally  spaced;  a  locked 
door or a flight of stairs might separate two locations, while 
another might be a point on a stretch of open road. Loca-
tions  divide  the  chase  into  narrative  chunks,  rather  than 
being a set physical distance. For example, a hotel might be 
divided  into  multiple  locations:  revolving  door,  crowded 
foyer, stairs, lifts, corridors, restaurant, kitchens, bedrooms, 
offices, and so on.

If  a  chase  takes  place  at  the  same  time  as  a  separate 
combat, the Keeper should ensure that the distance between 
locations is not excessive, otherwise you may end up with 
one group of characters running the length of a city block in 
the time it takes another investigator to smash a chair over 
a cultist’s head.
==========
Parts  1  to  4  have  covered  all  of  the  essential  chase  rules. 
This  final  part  includes  optional  rules  that  can  be  used  to 
embellish and further develop chases. 

Choosing a Route
It  is  the  nature  of  a  chase  that  the  character  being  chased 
(the quarry) wants nothing other than to escape and must 
make split-second decisions whether to turn left or right. If 
there is a choice of routes available, the lead character is free 
to choose and may seek a more difficult path or an easier 
one, especially if he or she feels it would be to their advan-
tage to do so. For example, a strong swimmer might opt to 
leap into the river to lose their pursuer. If the investigator 
is the one being pursued then the Keeper should regularly 
present a choice of routes.
==========
The chase is played out in rounds (much like combat). 
As each character’s turn begins, the Keeper should describe 
the situation, then ask what actions the investigator is taking 
that  round.  Only  then  should  the  Keeper  determine  what 
dice  rolls  are  required,  the  outcome  of  which  should  be 
incorporated into the story, perhaps changing the situation 
faced by the next player. 

These rules assume the fleeing character has an escape 
route. If a character is trapped then they must escape before 
a chase can ensue.

While some measure of gritty realism can be desirable, 
avoid becoming overly preoccupied with it. Always bear in 
mind that the aim is to create dramatic fiction, not to mirror 
real-world physics.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is a speed roll used for during a chase?,It is used to adjust the participant MOV rating for the whole duration of the chase,7,"A speed roll is used to adjust each participant's MOV (movement) rating for the duration of the chase. It is made by the participants to test their physical condition and endurance (for characters on foot or other self-propelled mode) or their handling of the vehicle (for drivers). The roll determines the MOV rating for the duration of the chase, with success resulting in no change, extreme success resulting in a +1 to MOV, and failure resulting in a -1 to MOV.","G  The pursuer is fast enough to catch the fleeing char-
acter. If this is the case, the game picks up the action 
at the most exciting moment—the point where the 
pursuer is closing in on the fleeing character. 

Speed Roll
This  roll  adjusts  each  participant’s  MOV  rating  for  the 
duration  of  this  chase.  Every  vehicle  and  character  has  a 
movement  rating  (MOV).  A  vehicle’s  speed  depends  on  a 
driver’s skill, while a character’s foot speed depends on their 
physical condition. 

Each participant in the chase makes a CON roll (if on 
foot or other self-propelled mode) to test his or her physical 
condition  and  endurance.  Drivers  make  a  Drive  Auto  roll 
(for vehicles) to test their handling of the vehicle.

G  On  a  success:  no  change  to  MOV  rating  for  the 

duration of this chase.

G  On  an  extreme  success:  +1  to  MOV  rating  for  the 

duration of this chase.

G  On a failure: –1 to MOV rating for the duration of 

this chase.

Chases with Multiple Characters
When running a chase with multiple characters, the only sig-
nificant difference lies in the initial phase; see Establishing the 
Chase (page 132).

First,  decide  who  is  chasing  whom  and  whether  the 
fleeing characters are staying together or splitting up. If they 
split up there will be multiple chases and each chase should 
be tracked and resolved separately.

Each  character  involved  in  a  chase  makes  a  speed  roll 
(using either Drive Auto or CON) to establish their MOV 
rate  for  the  chase  (see  Speed  roll,  page  132).  Once  this  is 
done, list the participants of the chase in speed order in their 
two groups: pursuers and fleeing characters.
Next, eliminate those not in the chase:
Any  fleeing  characters  who  are  faster  than  their  fastest 

pursuer may escape the chase entirely if they wish to.
==========
The increase in speed must be announced prior to mov-
ing.  Just  as  in  real  life,  driving  at  speed  is  less  risky  if  one 
has a good view of what lies on the road ahead. How far a 
driver can see at any time is wholly dependent on the situ-
ation and environment in which the chase is taking place. 
In a crowded city, one might only be able to see a couple of 
locations ahead (1D3 if you wish to determine it randomly); 
in the suburbs one can see several locations ahead (1D6 if 
you wish to determine it randomly), and in the country, on 
a straight road, one might see a considerable distance (1D10 
locations if you wish to determine it randomly). The Keeper

chapter 16: APPENDICESSummary of  
Chase Rules

Establishing the Chase

Decide  whether  fleeing  characters/vehicles  are  heading  in 
same  direction  or  splitting  up.  If  splitting  up,  decide  which 
pursuers  are  chasing  which  characters/vehicles.  If  you  have 
multiple groups, treat each one as a separate chase.

Speed roll: All participants make a skill roll: CON (if on foot 
or other self-propelled mode) or Drive Auto (for vehicles). 

G If passed: MOV remains unchanged. 
G If an Extreme success: MOV +1. 
G If failed: MOV –1.

Order each group separately in order of MOV.
Fleeing characters/vehicles with a speed greater than any 

of their pursuers may escape completely. 

Pursuers with a speed that is lower than the slowest flee-

ing character are completely out of the chase. 

Cut to the Chase 

Place the pursuers: Place pursuers in order, slowest at the 
rear, others a number of locations ahead equal to their differ-
ence in MOV.
==========
may  not  have  determined  what  these  upcoming  locations 
are, and should do so as required.

Once a decision has been made to accelerate and travel 
a number of locations on one movement action, it cannot 
be retracted; the vehicle will travel the full distance (2, 3, 4 
or 5 locations) or until it fails a hazard roll. If a hazard roll 
is  failed,  the  outcome  is  resolved,  after  which  any  further 
movement must be paid for and started afresh.

Any  penalty  dice  for  acceleration  should  be  applied  to 
hazards, but usually not when breaking through barriers, for 
which increased speed can be beneficial.

This increased speed can be used multiple times in one 
chase round. By putting the pedal to the metal, a car with 4 
movement  actions  could  potentially  move  20  locations  in 
one chase round.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How many movements can a chase participant take per round?,"Each participant can take one movement action per round, plus the difference between his movement rating and the movement rating of the slowest chase participant",7,"Each character gets one movement action by default, plus one movement action for each point by which their MOV rate exceeds that of the new slowest participant in the chase.","If a character joining a chase as a fleeing character has a 
MOV rate that is slower than the previously slowest member of 
the chase, some adjustment is required: the number of move-
ment actions that everyone in the chase has should be recal-
culated. Every character gets one movement action by default, 
plus one movement action for each point by which their MOV 
rate exceeds that of the new slowest participant in the chase. 

There  is  no  need  to  recalculate  speeds  or  movement 

actions when a character leaves a chase.

lowest.  In  the  case  of  a  draw,  use  an  opposed  DEX  roll  to 
decide who goes first.

Movement Actions
Each  character  gets  a  number  of  movement  actions  per 
round.  Movement  actions  are  used  to  move  from  one  lo-
cation  to  the  next.  Faster  characters  get  more  movement 
actions each round than slower characters.

Every  character  and  vehicle  gets  one  movement  action 
by  default.  To  this  is  added  the  difference  between  their 
movement  rating  (MOV)  and  the  movement  rating  of  the 
slowest participant in the chase. Thus the slowest participant 
will always have one movement action; someone with a MOV 
that is 1 above the slowest participant will have 2 movement 
actions,  someone  with  a  MOV  that  is  2  above  the  slowest 
participant will have 3 movement actions, and so on.

Compare Speeds
The  fleeing  character  escapes  if  their  adjusted  MOV  is 
higher  than  their  pursuer.  The  Keeper  is  free  to  narrate  a 
brief explanation of how this occurs, or to ask the players for 
suggestions. The chase is over and the Keeper should move 
the game on.

If the pursuer’s adjusted MOV rating is equal to or great-
er than that of the fleeing character, a chase is established, 
and the chase rules are bought into play. Proceed with Part 
2: Cut to the chase.

==========
First, these rules will address a simple one-on-one chase. 
Later in this chapter, chases with multiple participants will 
be explored. These rules are intended for characters involved 
in any type of chase, whether running, swimming or flying, 
and for vehicles of any kind. 

The rules for chases are presented in five parts. 

Part 1: Establishing the chase: A method for gauging wheth-
er  or  not  a  chase  needs  to  be  played  out  in  full.  In  cases 
where the fleeing character is determined to be fast enough 
to get away, the chase will go no further than Part 1.

Part 2: Cut to the chase: Provides the Keeper with a system 
for  laying  out  a  chase,  positioning  all  of  the  participants, 
and deciding the order of play and number of actions each 
participant can make.

Part  3:  Movement:  This  part  covers  the  essential  rules  for 
movement  and  for  dealing  with  the  various  hazards  and 
barriers that might be encountered.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What methods can the Keeper use to create obstacles and hazards during a chase?,"The Keeper can decide using his own imagination, or do that randomly using a 1D100 roll.",7,"According to the provided documents, the Keeper can use the following methods to create obstacles and hazards during a chase:

1. Positioning hazards and barriers between locations (Document 1).
2. Using a variety of hazards such as hairpin bends, slippery steps, thorny bushes, thick mud, etc. (Document 2).
3. Presenting the hazard and allowing each character to decide how to deal with it, taking into account their skill and movement rating (Document 2).
4. Making a skill roll to move through a hazard, with the Keeper inflicting damage and delay if the roll is failed (Document 3).
5. Allowing characters to take a cautious approach to hazards, spending movement actions to buy bonus dice for the skill roll (Document 3).

Additionally, the Keeper can use Table VI: Vehicular Collisions to determine the damage caused by a collision (Document 4).","tion trucks.

perform when setting up a chase:

==========
A chase is made up of a string of locations. The Keeper 
should  keep  careful  track  of  which  character  is  at  which 
location.  Depending  on  their  speed,  characters  may  move 
1 or more locations each round. Hazards and barriers (see 
following) are positioned between locations and may slow a 
character’s progress. 

Harvey flees from the farmer.

Keeping Track of the Chase
When  running  a  chase  scene  you  may  find  the  following 
method useful for tracking the various characters.

Take a blank sheet of paper or whiteboard. Draw a line 
of dots half an inch apart. Each dot represents one location. 
Label  the  first  dot  with  a  letter  representing  the  pursuer. 
Then  write  a  letter  for  the  fleeing  character  two  dots  on 
from the pursuer, depending on the opening range (see Cut 
to  the  Chase).  As  characters  move,  simply  cross  out  their 
marker and draw it on its new position.

Hazards add spice to a chase scene: hairpin bends, slip-
pery  steps,  thorny  bushes,  thick  mud,  and  so  on.  Hazards 
typically  slow  characters  and  vehicles  down,  and  if  badly 
handled, can also cause harm. 

The  Keeper  should  present  the  hazard  and  allow  each 
character  to  decide  how  they  deal  with  it.  Skill  is  always 
factor, and sometimes taking a cautious approach, slowing 
down in order to make a more considered attempt, can help. 
Other times, a reckless approach might be taken to use brute 
force and speed, such as when breaking down a locked door 
or taking corners at speed.
==========
Place  the  fleeing  characters:  Place  the  fleeing  characters/
vehicles in order, slowest at the rear (2 locations ahead of the 
lead  pursuer),  others  a  number  of  locations  ahead  equal  to 
their difference in MOV.

Position hazards and barriers.

Allocate  each  participant  a  number  of  movement  ac-
tions: Every character and vehicle gets one movement action 
by  default.  To  this  is  added  the  difference  between  their 
movement  rating  (MOV)  and  the  movement  rating  of  the 
slowest participant in the chase.

Determine DEX order

Hazards: Make a skill roll to move through a hazard. If the 
skill roll is failed, the Keeper may inflict damage (see Table III: 
Other Forms of Damage, page 124, or Table VI: Vehicular 
Collisions, page 147) and delay (1D3 movement actions).

Cautious  approach  to  hazards:  1  or  2  movement  actions 
may  be  spent  to  buy  1  or  2  bonus  dice  for  the  skill  roll  to 
negotiate a hazard.
==========
Fleeing the Scene
You may have a scene in which you wish to gauge how far 
the investigators manage to flee in a limited time. The chase 
rules can be used for this, counting the number of locations 
moved within a specified number of rounds. 

Vehicular Collisions
When a skill roll to negotiate a hazard is failed, the Keeper 
must consider the cause and the likely damage, and rate it 
against the left-hand column on Table VI: Vehicular Colli-
sions. If unsure, simply use the defaults of “minor incident” 
for  a  Regular  difficulty  level  hazard,  “moderate  incident” 
for  a  Hard  difficulty  level  hazard,  or “severe  incident”  for 
Extreme difficulty level hazards. 

The damage should also be rolled for each occupant of 
a vehicle involved in a collision, substituting “hit points” in 
place of “build”. Thus, a car that is in a moderate incident 
suffers  1D6  build  damage  and  each  occupant  of  the  car 
suffers 1D6 hit points of damage.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How are vehicle damages computed after a collision?,By rolling a 1D6 to compute build damage. A delay of the vehicle can also be computed costing a 1D3 movement action,7,"According to Document 2, vehicle damages are computed as follows:

- The vehicle inflicts 1D10 damage per point of build.
- Each full 10 hit points of damage decreases a vehicle's build by one point (round down).
- Any remaining damage below 10 points is ignored.
- Whenever a vehicle is used to inflict damage, it also suffers an amount of damage equal to half (round down) of that which it delivers, but never enough to cause it to lose a greater amount of build points than the target which it hit originally possessed.","If a vehicle takes damage equal to its full build value in one 
incident,  the  vehicle  is  completely  wrecked  in  an  impressive 
manner. It may explode, burn, roll or suffer some combination 
thereof. All occupants of the vehicle are likely to die. Whether or 
not investigators have a chance of survival is up to the Keeper: 
Luck rolls may be allowed. Those who are fortunate get thrown 
free, though it is recommended they take at least 2D10 damage. 
If a vehicle’s build is otherwise reduced to zero by cumu-
lative  damage  (i.e.  in  increments  of  less  than  the  vehicle’s 
starting build value), it becomes undrivable, grinding to a halt. 
Depending on the situation (and perhaps a Luck roll) this may 
lead to an accident resulting in 1D10 damage for the driver and 
each passenger. 

Armor for people: The armor rating is for the passengers and 
driver,  reflecting  the  number  of  points  of  armor  the  vehicle 
provides against external attacks.

==========
Vehicles may engage in combat using the regular combat 
rules,  substituting  Drive  Auto  skill  for  both  Fighting  and 
Dodge skills. Treat the vehicle as a weapon that inflicts 1D10 
damage per point of build. Each full 10 hit points of damage 
decreases a vehicle’s build by one point (round down); any 
remaining damage below 10 points is ignored. Whenever a 
vehicle is used to inflict damage, it also suffers an amount of 
damage equal to half (round down) of that which it delivers, 
but  never  enough  to  cause  it  to  lose  a  greater  amount  of 
build points than the target which it hit originally possessed. 

A car might do 50 (5D10) points of damage to a light 
motorcycle,  and  therefore  the  car  would  suffer  25 
points of damage itself (enough to cause a damage of 
2 Build points), but a light motorcycle only has Build 
1, so the damage to the car is limited to 1 build point.
==========
A  passenger  in  another  vehicle  fires  a  handgun  at 
Harvey. A Regular success is rolled for the firearms at-
tack. 1D10 damage is rolled, resulting in 10 damage. 
Harvey’s vehicle armor reduces this by 2, so Harvey 
takes 8 hit points damage. This is a major wound for 
Harvey,  who  wins  a  CON  roll  to  remain  conscious. 
He must now make a Drive Auto roll to keep control 
of  his  vehicle.  He  fails  the  roll.  The  Keeper  refers  to 
Table VI: Vehicular Collisions and chooses “moder-
ate incident” (it being a Hard difficulty level hazard), 
rolling 1 (1D6) point of build damage and a loss of 3 
(1D3) movement actions. This also results in 2 (1D6) 
hit  points  damage  for  Harvey.  The  Keeper  describes 
the  outcome;  Harvey  loses  control  of  his  car,  which 
glances off the side of an oncoming car, sending Har-
vey’s car spinning out of control. It takes him a while 
to  recover  control  and  rejoin  the  chase.  His  location 
remains unaltered.

Sanity  points  (even  a  single  point)  will  result  in  another 
bout of madness. This mental fragility remains for the full 

Fleeing in panic during a Bout of Madness.
==========
Indefinite Insanity 
On  losing  a  fifth  or  more  of  current  Sanity  points  in  one 
game “day,” the investigator becomes indefinitely insane. No 
investigator is simply able to shrug off this amount of san-
ity drain. A “day” in this instance is defined by the Keeper, 
usually lasting until the investigator reaches a place of safety 
in  which  they  can  rest  and  recover  their  wits.  Depending 
on the situation, it may mean surviving until dawn, sitting 
down for a nice cup of tea, or having a good night’s sleep. In-
definite insanity lasts until the character is cured or recovers 
(see Recovery from Indefinite Insanity, page 164).

Permanent Insanity 
When Sanity points are reduced to zero the investigator is 
permanently and incurably insane and ceases to be a player 
character. In the real world, all insanity is indefinite insanity, 
since  no  one  in  real  life  can  hope  to  predict  the  future  as 
accurately as a Call of Cthulhu Keeper can.
==========
Insanity Phase 1: A Bout of Madness
Also known as “the red mist,” “frenzy,” “freak out,”  
and “panic attack.”
On becoming insane, the investigator experiences a bout of 
madness. While experiencing a bout of madness, the inves-
tigator loses all self-control. In game terms this means that 
control of the investigator is handed from the player to the 
Keeper (for a short amount of real-world time). It is up to 
the Keeper whether this control takes the form of dictating 
specific actions or if it means giving the player guidelines on 
how to play out the madness for however long it may last.
==========
Insanity,  Indefinite:  Occurs  when  an 
investigator  loses  one-fifth  or  more  of 
current  Sanity  points  in  one  game  day 
and lasts until the character is cured or 
recovers (see page 156).

Insanity, Permanent: If current Sanity 
points  reach  zero,  the  investigator  is 
completely insane (perhaps permanent-
ly  institutionalized)  and  is  removed 
from play (see page 156).

Insanity, Temporary: When losing 5 or 
more  Sanity  points  because  of  a  single 
Sanity roll, the investigator has suffered 
emotional trauma. With a successful Idea 
roll,  the  investigator  fully  comprehends 
what has been seen and goes insane for 
1D10 hours (see page 155).

Fifth:  One-fifth  of  a  character’s  skill 
or  characteristic  on  1D100.  Used  for 
Extreme difficulty level.

Hazard:  A  location  in  a  chase  that  is 
likely to cause damage or delay, requir-
ing a skill roll.
==========
Note  that  while  suffering  a  bout  of  madness  the 
investigator is immune to further Sanity point loss and 
need not make a Sanity roll for seeing the monster. If 
the monster (delusion or not) is still present at the end 
of  the  bout  of  madness,  the  player  will  then  have  to 
make the appropriate Sanity roll for seeing the monster.

Treatment and 
Recovery from Insanity

Temporary insanity ends quickly enough that schedules of 
treatment  are  not  realistic.  On  the  other  hand,  treatment 
of  permanent  insanity  mostly  has  no  meaning,  since  by 
definition  the  character  will  never  recover,  no  matter  how 
good the facility (the character should be retired from play).

definite, it will consist of three distinct game phases:

First: the insanity begins with a brief “bout of madness,” during 
which the player’s control of their investigator is compromised 
(see Insanity Phase 1: A Bout of Madness, page 156). 

Second:  the  bout  of  madness  is  followed  by  a  period  of 
underlying  insanity,  during  which  the  player  retains  full 
control  of  their  investigator;  however,  the  investigator  is 
prone to delusions, phobias, and further bouts of madness 
(see Insanity Phase 2: Underlying Insanity, page 158). 

Third: the final phase is recovery (see Treatment and Re-
covery from Insanity, page 164).

Temporary Insanity 
If an investigator loses 5 or more Sanity points as the result 
of  one  Sanity  roll,  sufficient  emotional  trauma  has  been 
suffered that the Keeper must test the investigator’s sanity.

Each investigator has Sanity points that can rise and fall 
during play. Sanity is used to determine whether the inves-
tigator  can  withstand  the  horrors  of  the  Cthulhu  Mythos, 
as  well  as  stand  up  to  fear-inducing  situations  without 
turning  tail  and  running  away.  Loss  of  Sanity  points  can 
lead to insanity. When Sanity points are reduced to zero, an 
investigator is permanently and incurably insane, and ceases 
to be a player character.

Indefinite Insanity 
On  losing  a  fifth  or  more  of  current  Sanity  points  in  one 
game “day,” the investigator becomes indefinitely insane. No 
investigator is simply able to shrug off this amount of san-
ity drain. A “day” in this instance is defined by the Keeper, 
usually lasting until the investigator reaches a place of safety

How is it decided how many hours temporary insanity lasts?,By rolling a 1D10. The results of the roll provides the number of hours of insanity,8,"According to Document 0, temporary insanity lasts for 1D10 hours.","—H. P. Lovecraft, The Hound

Both temporary and indefinite insanity take the investigator 
through two distinct phases of insanity. First, the investiga-
tor experiences a short bout of madness (phase one). This 
is then followed by a longer period of underlying insanity 
(phase two), which lasts until the investigator has fully re-
covered (hours in the case of temporary insanity, months in 
the case of indefinite insanity).

What is the best way to recover from Indefinite Insanity?,The best way to recover is through private care or home care,8,"According to Document 2, the best way to recover from Indefinite Insanity is through treatment, which involves rolling a dice at the end of each month of treatment.","Recovery from  
Temporary Insanity
Temporary  insanity  lasts  1D10  hours.  Alternatively,  the 
investigator will recover after a good night’s sleep in a safe 
place.  If  the  investigators  are  in  a  state  of  heightened  ten-
sion  (for  example,  standing  watch  at  night  due  to  fear  of 
imminent attack), the Keeper may deem that sanity cannot 
be recovered.

Recovery from 
Indefinite Insanity
After  each  month  of  treatment  of  an  indefinitely  insane 
character, safe from further trauma, the player makes a dice 
roll. Two sorts of care might help to get the character to this 
point: private care or institutionalization. In choosing, the 
Keeper and player should consider the character’s resources, 
friends and relatives, and past behavior.

Alternatively,  at  the  Keeper’s  discretion,  indefinite  in-
sanity lasts until the next Investigator Development Phase 
at the end of the present game chapter (in a campaign) or 
scenario.

penalty die on skill rolls.

for delusions:

Failure: lose 1 Sanity point (and undergo a bout of  
madness if insane).
Success: dismiss delusions.

Mythos  skill  with  first  bout  of  madness  inspired  by  a 
Mythos-related event. Add 1% on subsequent occasions.

Insanity Phase 2: Underlying Insanity
Once  the  initial  bout  of  madness  is  over,  the  investigator 
enters a lower-level state of underlying insanity. Control of 
the investigator is placed firmly in the hands of the player, 
who may freely choose how to roleplay being insane. While 
the  player  is  not  compelled  to  do  so,  aspects  of  the  initial 
bout of madness might be reincorporated for the duration 
of the underlying insanity. 

While  in  the  fragile  state  of  underlying  insanity  (after 
the initial bout of madness has passed) any further loss of 
Sanity  points  (even  a  single  point)  will  result  in  another 
bout of madness. This mental fragility remains for the full

How many language skill ticks should be awarded when an investigator conducts a full study of a tome in that language?,One,9,"According to Document 0, when an investigator conducts a full study of a tome, they automatically gain a skill tick for the language in which the book is written.","Increase of Other Skills
Conducting  a  full  study  of  a  tome  may  grant  an  increase 
in other skills as well as Cthulhu Mythos. After a full study 
of a tome, the reader automatically gains a skill tick for the 
language in which the book is written, and so their skill in 
that language may improve in the usual way during the next 
investigator development phase (see page 94). The Keeper 
should also determine whether a particular tome will pro-
vide  additional  benefits  to  the  reader.  Increases  should  be 
either  limited  to  +1D6  to  +1D10  skill  points  per  skill,  or 
simply awarded as a skill tick to be rolled during the next 
investigator  development  phase.  Other  skills  that  may  be 
improved as a result of reading Mythos tomes include (but 
are not limited to) History, Archaeology, Anthropology, Oc-
cult, Astronomy, and other sciences like Chemistry, Biology, 
and Physics.
==========
Language (Own) (EDU%)
When  choosing  this  skill,  the  exact  language  must  be 
specified and written next to the skill. In infancy and early 
childhood, most humans use a single language. The tongue 
chosen by the player for the Own Language automatically 
starts  as  equal  to  the  investigator’s  EDU  characteristic; 
thereafter  the  investigator  understands,  speaks,  reads,  and 
writes at that percentage or higher (if further skill points are 
added during investigator creation).

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Normally  no  skill  roll  is  necessary  to  use  Own  Language. 
Even when technical, archaic, or esoteric terms are used, if 

both parties are sympathetic to each other and there is suf-
ficient time for conversation, most things should be covered 
without a die roll.

If  a  document  is  extremely  difficult  to  read  or  in  an 

archaic dialect, the Keeper may require a roll.

Pushing examples: see Language (Other) skill, above.

or possibly an Occult roll. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Regular conversation, perhaps with pauses for clarification 
(when speaking to a less than fluent foreign speaker) does 
not require a roll for those who are fluent.

i  Regular difficulty: conversation (perhaps at speed);

common terms.

historically archaic phrases; speaker has unusual dialect.

Skill percentiles are not proportions of what is hypothet-
ically  knowable.  If  they  were  able  to  stack  their  respective 
knowledge on a table like poker chips and measure the dif-
ference, a physicist of 60% in the modern day knows much 
more than a physicist of 90% skill in 1910. 

Equally, some skills would be affected by location. A Jap-
anese investigator might have a Law skill of 75% in Japan; 
however if the same investigator were tested on Spanish law 
then the Keeper would probably increase the level of diffi-
culty of the roll.

A skill level of 50% is high enough to let a character eke 
out a living from it. If an investigator rises high in a skill un-
related to their profession, player and Keeper could confer 
about changing the investigator to a new profession.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How can a character learn a spell?,"There are three main ways to learn a spell: from a Mythos book, from another player, or from a Mythos entity",9,"A character can learn a spell in three ways: 

1. Learning from a book (Document 2: 176-177), which can take hours, days, weeks, or months (typically 2D6 weeks).
2. One-on-one teaching by another person (Document 0), which is quicker than learning from a book and typically takes one week or less (1D8 days).
3. It is also implied that a character can learn a spell from another person through a process similar to learning from a book, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided documents.","Learning a Spell from Another Person
Having  learned  a  spell,  a  character  may  teach  it  to  others. 
One-on-one  teaching  is  quicker  than  one  person  learning 
from  a  book  and,  typically,  a  spell  can  be  learned  in  one 
week or less (1D8 days). Use the same rules as for learning 
a spell from a book, bearing in mind that the process will 
be faster.

176
==========
Knowledge of a spell can be transferred in three ways, listed 
below. Learning from a book is by far the most common method.

Magic Points (MP)
Magic points must (in most cases) be expended to cast spells, 
as  well  as  to  energize  artifacts,  power  magical  gates,  and 
so  on. An  investigator  begins  the  game  with  Magic  points 
equal to one-fifth of his or her POW; however, cultists and 
powerful  sorcerers  often  have  larger  pools  of  points  from 
which to draw. 

Once an individual is out of Magic points, any further ex-
penditure is deducted directly from hit points. Any such loss of 
hit points will manifest as physical damage in a form chosen by 
the Keeper—perhaps sores and cuts opening on the body, skin 
blistering, or blood running from the eyes or ears.
==========
To  learn  a  spell  from  a  Mythos  book  requires  that  the 
investigator has at least made an initial reading of the book. 
The investigator chooses the spell to study. Learning a spell 
can take hours, days, weeks, or months (typically 2D6 weeks, 
but at the Keeper’s discretion). Just as with reading a Mythos 
book, learning a Mythos spell may be taken up, put aside, 
and  taken  up  again,  as  convenient.  Usually  a  roll  is  called 
for at this stage; however, the Keeper may choose to grant 
automatic success, depending on the scenario.

Physical components may be necessary for particular spells. 
Such components may be reusable; for example, the great men-
hirs necessary for summoning He Who Is Not to Be Named 
(Call Hastur, see page 248). Other components may be con-
sumed during the spell, such as the drinking of space-mead.

The time required to cast a spell is variable—it may be 
instantaneous, a few seconds, a game minute, a game week, 
or longer.

The caster must know the spell and recite a sometimes 
complex  and  lengthy  chant  or  rite  in  authoritative  tones. 
Usually  the  caster  must  have  complete  freedom  of  move-
ment, since gesture can be as important as chant.

Usually  the  caster  must  have  complete  freedom  of  move-
ment, since gesture can be as important as chant.

spell) is to go back to the source and learn the spell again

casting  roll  may  be  made—this  is  a  much  more  cautious 
approach  than  pushing  the  casting  roll.  This  is  one  of  the

==========
Opposed POW Rolls
Many spells call for a POW roll to be made to test whether 
the spell affects its target. Both sides make a POW roll and 
compare their levels of success, with the higher one being 
the victor. In the case of a tie, the higher POW wins; if the 
sides are still drawn, the Keeper might decide that both are 
affected adversely in some manner that reflects the nature of 
the spell. If the difference between the caster’s POW and the 
target’s POW is 100 or more, the one with the greater POW 
automatically wins.

Spell Range
In the game, spell range is usually one of three options: touch, 
100 yards, or sight with the unaided eye. These general choic-
es  are  easy  to  visualize  and  understand.  Greater  ranges  can 
become engineering problems, not examples of horror. 

Casting Time and Spells in 
Combat
Some spells are useful in combat situations. Each spell has a 
casting time listed in its description: instantaneous, 1 round, 
and so on.
==========
Failing a Pushed 
Casting Roll
The caster must pay the cost of the spell (Magic points, San-
ity points, and/or POW) multiplied by 1D6. Any overspend 
of Magic points is deducted from hit points—this can cause 
major wounds or death when pushing powerful spells. 

The  Keeper  should  add  one  or  more  of  the  following 
side  effects  for  less  powerful  spells  (choose  or  roll  1D8). 
Note that both the caster and others nearby can be affected.

1:  Blurred vision or temporary blindness.
2:  Disembodied screaming, voices, or other noises.
3:  Strong winds or other atmospheric effects.
4:  Bleeding—from  the  caster,  others  present,  or  the 

environment (e.g. the walls).
5:  Strange visions and hallucinations.
6:  Small animals in the vicinity explode.
7:  Foul smell of brimstone.

cost POW for example), the side effects can be worse:",You are a helpful AI assistant.

Disrupted Spell Casting
The  casting  of  a  spell  will  be  disrupted  if  the  caster  is  sig-
nificantly distracted (physically struck or shot, for example) 
during its casting.. The Keeper may consult the charts for the 
consequences  of  failing  a  pushed  casting  roll  (see  previous 
page) for inspiration on what might happen. The caster of a 
failed spell casting must still pay the Sanity point and Magic 
point costs.

Becoming a Believer

Leng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not 
a region I would care to be in or near, nor did I relish the 
proximity of a world that had ever bred such ambiguous and 
Archaean monstrosities as those Lake had just mentioned. 
At the moment I felt sorry that I had ever read the abhorred 
Necronomicon, or talked so much with that unpleasantly 
erudite folklorist Wilmarth at the university.

==========
Failure
The player stated a goal and has failed to achieve it, but exactly 
how  the  player’s  investigator  has  failed  is  entirely  up  to  the 
Keeper (though of course the players may throw in suggestions). 
Initial failure at a skill roll should not usually inflict damage 
or Sanity loss, but this depends on the circumstances. A failed 
roll could represent failure to act rather than a failed attempt. 
Worse things may happen if the player chooses to push the roll 
and fails a second time (see Pushing the Roll). Save ""what’s the 
worst that could happen?"" style consequences for pushed rolls.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What information is advised that the Keeper gives to the players before they create their investigators?,"The date and location of the player scenario, a basic description of the beginning of the scenario, professions suitable for the scenario, and suggestions on how the investigator know each other",10,"According to Document 1, the Keeper should consider the players' occupation and skill set in relation to the other players and the scenario, and discuss their ideas with the other players to build the most appropriate group of investigators.","“thick  of  things.”  The  Keeper  should  consider  the  clue  on 
offer and try to come up with the worst situation in which 
the investigators might realize it. The Keeper starts the game 
again in medias res and the players must deal with the situa-
tion in which they find themselves.
==========
Also,  you  might  want  to  consider  your  investiga-
tor’s  occupation  and  skill  set  in  relation  to  the  other 
players  and  what  kind  of  investigators  they  will  be 
playing. Creating a balance of occupations means that 
the group has a good mix of skills that will benefit ev-
eryone. Depending on the style of game and scenario 
you  will  be  playing,  your  Keeper  might  have  certain 
occupations in mind for you to play. Discuss your ideas 
with the other players in order to build the most appro-
priate group of investigators for your game. After all, it 
will be somewhat strange for everyone to turn up with 
musicians when the scenario is set in the Antarctic! 

Remember,  it’s  not  what  your  investigator  can  or 
can’t do, it’s how you decide to ‘play’ your character 
that is really important, and that, above all, will often 
determine your enjoyment of the game!
==========
The  Keeper  should  never  be  afraid  of  adverse  conse-
quences  to  the  investigators’  actions  (up  to  the  point  of 
simply  destroying  them  out  of  hand  of  course,  which  is 
largely  unsatisfactory  for  everybody  in  the  game!),  when 
they  are  merited  and  logical  within  the  story  and  plot  of 

the scenario. The wrong question in the wrong ear, public 
displays of force or general heavy-handedness in conducting 
their business may tip the thief to the investigator’s actions 
and paint them as a threat to be dealt with, by fair means 
or foul. This might turn the tables on the player characters, 
who themselves might then become subject to investigation, 
pursuit, pressure, and even attack, all of which can make for 
a richer and more thrilling game.
==========
Running With What the Players 
Throw at You
Your players may well take an approach to the story that you 
have not thought of or planned for. Many Keepers will be 
tempted to block the players’ progress, simply saying no and 
steering the players back towards the story that the Keeper 
has prepared. Instead of that, where possible, try to incor-
porate  the  players’  suggestions,  especially  if  you  can  add 
complications of your own to their contribution. Wherever 
possible you should try to have an attitude of “Yes, and…” 
or “Yes, but…” rather than a flat “No”.

An investigator decides to make a telephone call to the 
local police. The Keeper has three options:

No: The Keeper could tell the players that they are 
the investigators and that it is not in the spirit of the 
game for them to call the police. This is clearly not a 
pleasing option for anyone.

Before  reading  this  chapter  make  sure  you  have  read 

chapters 4-10. 

New Keepers
When you act as Keeper you become the game moderator. 
Whether you are using a published scenario or creating one 
of your own, you alone know the story plot and the likely 
outcomes and solutions. Your job is to present the mystery 
and story during play, incidentally playing the roles of mon-
sters and sinister or ordinary people that the investigators 
meet. You have the responsibility for preparing and running 
the scenario without bias. Above all else, you should listen to 
your players and react to what they say and do.",You are a helpful AI assistant.

Non-Player Characters 
(NPCs)
The players control their investigators; the Keeper controls 
everyone else in the world, known as non-player characters. 
These can come into the game in a number of ways.

You may find that players suggest ideas for non-player 
characters  when  making  their 
investigators:  relatives, 
colleagues,  friends,  or  enemies.  Refer  to  the  investigators’ 
backstories for these and take careful note of any details for 
later incorporation into the scenario.

Investigators  may  establish  contacts  during  the  game 

(see Contacts, page 97).

Your plot will include some key non-player characters—

the villains!
==========
Playing Within the Limits of  
Character Knowledge
When  roleplaying  non-player  characters,  remember  that 
they  don’t  know  everything  that  you  know  as  Keeper.  It’s 
easy to make non-player characters infallible, but it can be 
a lot more fun to play up their flaws. Non-player characters 
can make mistakes, misunderstand, and fail just as readily as 
the investigators. Cultists are only human, so let them make 
human  mistakes  too.  Their  mistakes  may  serve  to  further 
confound the players, who may seek some rationale for the 
non-player characters’ curiously mistaken activities.

Using Props to 
Present NPCs
Games of Call of Cthulhu can feature a wide variety 
of  non-player  characters—that’s  before  we  even  get 
to the monsters! Keeping track of who’s who can be 
daunting for both the Keeper and the players. Prepar-
ing some simple props ahead of the game can help.
==========
NPC:  Non-Player  Character,  played  by

Obscure Clue: The Keeper may decide 
to withhold a clue if the players fail their

deliver it to a player (see page 202).

Converting Non-Player 
Characters, Gods, Beasts 
and Monsters
Human NPCs that are fully detailed may be converted using 
the same rules as for investigators (above). Usually NPCs are 
less detailed than investigators and may be converted using 
the guidelines for monsters.

Characteristics: Characteristic scores from previous editions 
are simply multiplied by five to provide 7th Edition values. 
Since characteristics for NPCs and monsters are mostly used 
for setting the difficulty level for players’ skill rolls, there is no 
need to record the half and fifth values.

Skills: Most NPCs and monsters have only a limited number 
of  skills  listed,  which  for  the  most  part  can  remain  for  7th 
Edition use. If the character has skills no longer used in 7th 
Edition then assign the value to a comparable skill.

What is an Idea Roll?,"It is a roll that allows players to get a clue, and that decides how they get this clue",10,"An Idea Roll is a mechanic in the game where a player rolls dice to determine how they obtain a missed clue, with the goal of getting the investigation back on track. It is usually called when the players are stuck and need help from the Keeper. The roll determines the ease or difficulty of obtaining the clue, and its success or failure can have consequences for the investigators. (Document 0, Document 1)","the Keeper. This might include solving a crossword puzzle 
or answering a riddle.

An Idea roll is different than an Intelligence roll, although 
made in the same manner by rolling equal to or below the 
investigator’s Intelligence characteristic. An Idea roll is usually 
proposed by the players when their investigators have become 
stuck at a point in the investigation; perhaps they have com-
pletely missed a vital clue, or just don’t know what to do next, 
and so the game has stalled. The outcome of the Idea roll will 
get  the  investigation  back  on  track;  however,  the  success  or 
failure of the Idea roll determines whether the missed clue has 
been obtained easily, or at some cost to the investigators (see 
Chapter 10 for more advice about Idea rolls).
==========
This is where the Idea roll comes in. The players will get 
the clue regardless of whether they pass the Idea roll or not. 
An Idea roll is a highly significant and unusual event in the 
game. The roll determines not if, but how they get the clue. 
The goal of an Idea roll is always “to get the investigation 
back on track”. The Keeper starts by figuring out which was 
the most important clue the players missed and uses this to 
set a difficulty level for the Idea roll as follows. One player 
(whose investigator has the highest INT) then rolls dice for 
the Idea roll:
==========
You may well find that your group never resorts to using 
the Idea roll. Indeed, you may find that your group is never 
at a loose end and always have some ideas of their own as to 
how the story might proceed. Alternatively, the players may 
get stuck, but be so cautious that they refuse to call for an Idea 
roll. If this is the case, you can draw the current chapter of the 
game to a close and carry out investigator development phase 
(rolling skill improvement and so on). Then ask the players 
what their likely courses of action might now be. If you feel 
the  players  lack  direction,  you  should  insist  on  starting  the 
next part of the game with an Idea roll, using it to determine 
whether things restart well for the investigators or not.
==========
Intelligence Rolls and Idea Rolls
An Intelligence (INT) roll may be called for by the Keeper 
when  an  investigator  is  attempting  to  solve  an  intellectual 
puzzle of some kind. By rolling equal to or below the inves-
tigator’s Intelligence, the player will receive a solution from 

the Keeper. This might include solving a crossword puzzle 
or answering a riddle.
==========
The setting of difficulty levels for Idea rolls may appear 
counterintuitive;  the  more  obvious  a  clue  was  made,  the 
more  difficult  the  Idea  roll  is.  The  Keeper  is  not  trying  to 
figure  out  the  likelihood  of  the  investigators  realizing  the 
clue—this  is  something  they  are  incapable  of,  as  fictional 
characters. The Keeper is offering the players a gamble, ask-
ing them to risk the negative consequences to gain the clue. 
A part of the role of players is to take note of clues during 
the game. There is a balance between the Keeper giving clues 
out  and  the  players  taking  clues  in.  The  Idea  roll  aims  to 
reflect  this  balance.  If  the  clue  has  never  been  mentioned, 
the balance must be redressed in the players’ favor and this is 
achieved by giving the players a strong chance of getting the 
clue for free. If the clue has been made obvious but some-
how missed by the players, the players have had their chance",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What are the Mythos Tomes,"They are books of arcane wisdom, secret and magic",11,"Mythos Tomes are ancient, often rare and forbidden books that contain knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos. They are typically bound in leather, sometimes with a slimy residue, and may have a distinct ""character"" or personality that reflects the history and previous owners of the book. These tomes often contain blasphemous and scandalous information, and their contents may be ink-stained, acid-scarred, or defaced by those who have attempted to destroy them. They can be found in rare book sections of universities, private collections, and may be sought after by investigators who are willing to risk their sanity to uncover their secrets.","Describing Mythos Tomes
Some Mythos volumes are recent enough in origin to have 
been printed with movable type. Those editions were usu-
ally published privately in short press runs and only sold to 
rich  collectors  or  acquaintances.  Upon  publication,  copies 
often were sought out and destroyed by the authorities due 
to their scandalous nature. Better these texts be burned and 
suppressed. Such was the fate of the original publication of 
The King in Yellow. 

Where surviving copies exist, these have often have been 
ill-treated  by  the  crazed  or  malicious,  or  else  rebound  to 
disguise  their  blasphemous  contents.  Bound  manuscripts 
were  never  regularized  by  typesetting  and  printing,  and 
their wavering, blotted handwriting may be wholly incom-
prehensible for pages at a time, a situation remedied only by 
great dedication and scholarship.

A Note About the Entries
Information about the tomes described may be known by 
erudite  bibliophiles,  historians,  and  by  a  few  in  the  rare 
book  trade.  While  it  is  unlikely  that  such  books  will  be 
found  on  the  shelves  of  the  common  public  library,  some 

can be found in the rare book sections of certain universities 
and in private collections. Apart from those listed, other ver-
sions, as well as lesser Mythos works exist, as do incidental 
notebooks, diaries, and letters. Keepers are advised to review 
the entries for inspiration when designing new volumes of 
forgotten lore, cultist notebooks, and so on.

Where  two  dates  are  noted  for  multiple  Mythos  books: 
the latter date in each case is the date ascribed in the original 
story. Some dates are conjectural. If available at all, the num-
ber of copies listed reflects those known to be held in public 
and private collections. More existing copies are very likely.
==========
If  a  you  create  a  new  Mythos  tome  for  some  purpose, 
you should have a suitable name for it, know the language of 
its composition, know what it looks and feels like, know how 
many Sanity points are lost in reading it, know how many 
Cthulhu Mythos points its comprehension adds, and be able 
to determine what spells (if any) can be found within it.

Using Mythos Tomes
Despite the dangers, investigators will choose to study this or 
that terrifying book. The process of reading can be leisurely 
and can be suspended at any point for as long as need be.
==========
Even though each book’s summary is uniform in these 
rules, assume that each copy of a Mythos book can be dif-
ferent  from  its  fellows.  Though  the  logic  of  that  potential 
diminishes  for  recent  books,  such  as  Azathoth  and  Others, 
even  then  bindings  may  be  broken,  pages  torn  out,  and 
signatures  missing  or  wrongly  collated.  Contents  may  be 
ink-stained or acid-scarred, with pages half-burnt and the 
words made illegible or utterly defaced by madmen (or by 
sane men who sought to destroy the dangerous information 
therein). Unique information may be written as marginalia 
or jotted down on notepaper and inserted here or there.
==========
Some  tomes  begin  to  possess  their  own “character”  as 
they  grow  in  age.  Passed  down  through  the  generations, 
between  family  members,  booksellers,  and  collectors,  the 
tomes seem to absorb an imprint of their owners. This can 
be  more  than  simply  the  wandering  marginalia  of  occult 
scholars,  with  some  books  apparently  manifesting  distinct 
“personalities”  that  echo  once-powerful  owners,  such  as 
grand sorcerers and cult potentates. Consider the smell, feel, 
and look of Mythos books. The overall impression ought to 
be distinctly unhealthy. The binding will probably be leath-
er, perhaps human or even that of some unworldly being. 
Does the leather leave a slimy residue when touched? Does 
the book leave a musky odor wherever it has been? Does the 
presence of the tome cause the pages of other, nearby books 
to char and blacken? Perhaps the book appears to move of 
its  own  accord,  never  to  be  found  where  the  investigator",You are a helpful AI assistant.

A third full study would take Harvey 128 weeks (al-
most two and a half years).

Mythos Rating—Books as References
Once a full study of a tome has been completed, the percen-
tiles entered for its Cthulhu Mythos Rating also quantify its 
usefulness as a Mythos reference. Such a book may be able to 
provide a specific fact about the Mythos (such as how long 
a  chthonian  takes  to  reach  maturity,  or  where Y’golonac’s 
body  awaits  its  resurrection)  that  might  be  useful  to  the 
investigator’s current situation or line of research.
==========
Such a study can take many months. At the end of such 
a  course  of  study,  the  reader  must  make  a  roll  for  Sanity 
point loss appropriate for the tome (if a Believer, see page 
179). The tome’s Mythos rating is then compared with the 
reader’s Cthulhu Mythos knowledge. If the reader’s Cthulhu 
Mythos skill is below the Mythos rating of  the  book, they 
gain Cthulhu Mythos points equal to the full study (CMF) 
number.  If  the  reader’s  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  is  equal  to  or 
above  the  book’s  Mythos  rating,  they  only  receive  Cthulhu

An Example of One Spell with Variations
A spell could be compared with a cooking recipe. There is 
no  definitive  bread  recipe;  soda  bread  can  be  made  in  an 
hour while sourdough bread takes days. A variety of flours 
and other ingredients may be used. The methods of making 
can  vary;  it  can  be  done  by  hand  or  with  a  machine.  The 
resulting breads come in all shapes, sizes, and flavors. If you 
look at ten cookbooks, you will find many differing recipes 
for bread with many different names. The same is true for 
spells and tomes.

Ten tomes might list what appears at first glance to be 
the same spell; however, the specific spells will be no more 
similar  than  all  those  bread  recipes—there  is  a  world  of 
difference  between  German  black  bread  and  focaccia.  Just 
as you would choose a bread that suits your menu, so you 
may tailor a spell to fit your game. Let’s take the spell Create 
Zombie and look at a few variations.
==========
Look at the spells in this book and find one that approx-
imates the magnitude of effect of your new spell. This will 
provide a starting point as to the cost in magic points, POW 
and Sanity points.

Consider  how  easy  the  spell  will  be  to  cast.  A  caster 
might have 16 magic points and be able to burn some hit 
points to increase this number to, let’s say, 25. Beyond this, 
the caster will either require a reservoir of magic points or 
additional participants in the casting to donate magic points 
of their own. Some spells require POW to be spent. POW 
can be accrued by wizards through certain spells or items, 
such as an enchanted cane.

Sacrifices  and  other  morally  objectionable  rites  can  be 
added to spells for two purposes. First, to evoke the theme of 
horror. Second, to make the spells either difficult or a moral 
dilemma for the players. For example, will the players want 
to use a spell that can thwart the opposition if it requires a 
human sacrifice?
==========
Spell Variations
There is no such thing as a definitive spell. The ones listed 
here are only a guide and starting point for the Keeper to 
draw upon. This is not a game in which the players can ex-
pect their characters to gain spells as a matter of course. The 
players  should  be  aware  that  any  spells  their  investigators 
gain may vary from the ones listed in this book. Part of the 
Keeper’s job is to act as intermediary between this Grimoire 
and the players.

242
==========
Opposed POW Rolls
Many spells call for a POW roll to be made to test whether 
the spell affects its target. Both sides make a POW roll and 
compare their levels of success, with the higher one being 
the victor. In the case of a tie, the higher POW wins; if the 
sides are still drawn, the Keeper might decide that both are 
affected adversely in some manner that reflects the nature of 
the spell. If the difference between the caster’s POW and the 
target’s POW is 100 or more, the one with the greater POW 
automatically wins.

Spell Range
In the game, spell range is usually one of three options: touch, 
100 yards, or sight with the unaided eye. These general choic-
es  are  easy  to  visualize  and  understand.  Greater  ranges  can 
become engineering problems, not examples of horror. 

Casting Time and Spells in 
Combat
Some spells are useful in combat situations. Each spell has a 
casting time listed in its description: instantaneous, 1 round, 
and so on.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How long does a Banishment of Yde Etad spell last at minimum?,1 hour,12,The minimum casting time for the Banishment of Yde Etad spell is 1 hour.,"Having  one’s  own  insides  removed  costs  2D10  Sanity 
points and the permanent loss of 5 POW per organ removed. 
Attacks that impale cause only normal damage (unless the 
head  is  specifically  targeted).  Invulnerability  stems  from 
which  organ  is  removed;  for  example  if  the  lungs  are  re-
moved then the caster is unaffected by lack of oxygen (thus 
drowning and suffocation are no longer threats). Removal 
of vital organs may also render the caster immune to poison 
and so forth.

If the caster is harmed, hit points should be reduced as 
usual, leading to unconsciousness but not death. Death will 
only occur if the brain is specifically targeted and destroyed.
Alternative names: Imbue Essence, Extraction of the Will, 

The Deathless Breath.

Also,  try  to  use  evocative  and  subtle  names  for 
the actual Mythos deities rather than simply using 
their common names. There’s no reason why a spell 
name  concerning  Yog-Sothoth  couldn’t  reference 
the  being  as  The  Hideous  Spheres,  or  The  Un-
quenchable Thirster of Souls, and so forth. Keeping 
the players guessing about what a spell will do or to 
whom it’s connected can help to stimulate mystery 
and fear of the unknown

Cause/Cure Blindness
Cost:  8  magic  points  (and  2D6  Sanity  points  for  Cause 
Blindness)
Casting time: 1 day
==========
With  the  exception  of  Summon/Bind  Servitor  of  the 
Outer  Gods,  these  spells  require  the  sacrifice  of  1  magic 
point per 10 percentiles chance for success. For example, 3 
magic points gives a 30% chance for the spell to succeed. In 
general, for each magic point spent, the caster must spend 
five minutes chanting—the greater the chance for success, 
the longer the spell takes to cast. A result of 96-100 is always 
a  failure—a  rolled  result  of  100  should  always  have  bad 
consequences for the wizard concerned.

The  caster  also  loses  1D4  Sanity  points  per  spell  cast, 

whether the spell succeeds or not.

Form of the Command
==========
Alternative  names:  Ye  Rite  of  Ill  Fortune,  Dark  Curse,

Fist of Yog-Sothoth
Cost: variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: Instantaneous

The  caster  causes  a  massive,  invisible  force  to  hit  a  single 
target. The caster must be able to see the target.

Each magic point invested in the spell yields 2D10 STR 
of force. For every 30 feet of distance that the caster stands 
from the target (after the first thirty feet), the caster must 
spend an additional magic point.

When the target is struck (if a living thing), an opposed 
roll must be made using the spell’s STR versus the target’s 
CON.  If  successful,  the  target  is  knocked  unconscious. 
Whether or not the target is left unconscious, the target is 
always  pushed  away  from  the  caster  for  a  distance  in  feet 
equal to the STR of the blow minus the target’s SIZ.
==========
8 magic points opens the way for Cthugha, represent-
ing  a  5%  chance  for  dismissal.  Sacrificing  10  more 
magic points increases the chance to 55%. To have a 
99% (the maximum achievable) chance of dismissing 
Cthugha, those assembled must sacrifice 8+19 magic 
points in the two stages, a total of 27 magic points.

Roll  1D100  against  the  total  chance  for  the  dismissal. 
As with Call Deity, the caster is the focus of the spell; other 
members of the group can contribute magic points. Dismiss 
Deity costs no Sanity points.

Call  Deity  spells  always  require  special  conditions  and 
rituals; however, the Dismiss portion of the spell can be cast 
anytime, anywhere.

What is the cost of a Bless Blade?,5 POW and 1D4 sanity points,12,The cost of a Bless Blade is 5 POW and 1D4 Sanity points.,"The  spell  must  be  performed  in  the  open  air  in  the 
middle of the night, ideally in a place of power associated

Bless Blade
Cost: 5 POW; 1D4 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 hour

Creates a blade capable of damaging or killing entities that 
cannot  be  harmed  by  mundane  weapons.  Requires  the 
blood sacrifice of an animal of at least SIZ 50. The blade of 
the knife must be of an elemental metal such as iron or sil-
ver. The blade may be of any size; however, larger blades do 
greater damage(see Table XVII: Weapons, pages 401-405).
==========
Enchant Knife
Cost: variable POW; 1D4 Sanity points
Casting time: 2 hours

An  enchanted  knife  increases  the  success  chance  for  other 
spells. The spell enchants a knife or dagger made of a pure 
metal, such as gold or iron. With the knife blade an intricate 
diagram is drawn on a flat surface and then the blade is used 
to kill an animal of at least SIZ 20. The creature’s blood is 
then traced out to follow the lines of the drawn diagram and 
the enchantment is complete.

Such  a  knife  is  suitable  for  use  in  casting  Summon 
Dimensional Shambler. Every point of POW placed into it 
adds  1  percentile  to  the  chance  for  success  in  casting  that 
spell.  If  this  knife  is  used  to  slay  the  small  animal  for  En-
chant Brazier, the brazier so made adds 10 percentiles to the 
chance for successfully casting Conjure Glass of Mortlan.

Which spell can a cultist use to get in touch with alien races?,The Contact Spell,12,"According to Document 0, a cultist can use Contact spells to get in touch with alien races, and it does not specify which particular spell. However, Document 1 mentions that the spell brings a random member of the species, and it does not specify which species.","Contact spells are divided into two separate groups: spells 
concerned with contacting Mythos creatures and monsters, 
and spells for contacting Mythos deities (see Contact Deity). 
Using  Contact  spells  a  cultist  could  get  in  touch  with 
monsters  and  alien  races,  perhaps  to  learn  about  magic, 
gods, or alien species. The caster should have a definite goal 
in mind; bargains might be struck and plans negotiated. 

Contact  spells  do  not  give  the  caster  the  upper  hand 
though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. 
Remember  these  are  independent  and  intelligent  beings 
with their own motivations—casters make contact at their 
peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells (see 
page 263) that have the potential to allow casters to bind the 
summoned beings to their will. 

250
==========
The spell brings a random member of the species, pre-
sumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be 
alone, or to be with no more than a small group, in order 
not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, 
it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, 
the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve.

If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only 
one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper 
may determine if several representatives arrive as a group.

There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather 
bargain with, or devour, the caster. It will have an alien moti-
vation; however, if further contact seems of advantage to both 
sides, then some interesting roleplaying may emerge.

As mentioned, each version of the spell requires certain 

conditions to be in place for it to work.
==========
Cost: 3 or more magic points

Contact Star-Spawn of Cthulhu: Unless there are no repre-
sentatives nearby, it succeeds automatically. It should be cast 
at the ocean shore, perhaps near a deep one outpost or else 
near a spot where star-spawn may sleep. The spell works well 
in Polynesia, along the Massachusetts coast, and above R’lyeh.

Cost: 6 magic points

Contact Yithian: This spell does not reach forward or back-
ward  in  time.  If  a Yithian  mind  occupies  a  subject  within 
one hundred miles of the caster at the time the spell is cast, 
the Yithian notices the appeal and may respond if curious, 
fearful,  or  alarmed.  If  the  caster  has  nothing  interesting 
to  say  or  offer,  then  the  Great  Race  scholar  ignores  later 
questions, or perhaps destroys the caster as a likely pest or 
nuisance.

Cost: 4 magic points
==========
Contact  Deity:  Cthulhu:  Opens  communication  with 
Cthulhu.  Cthulhu  typically  responds  at  night,  during  the 
caster’s dreams. By dreams and nightmares he informs his 
followers of his desires.

Contact  Deity:  Eihort:  Resembles  other  Contact  Deity 
spells,  but  the  caster  sacrifices  1  magic  point  in  casting  it. 
The god automatically appears in dream form if the caster 
is distant and in person if within a few hundred yards. In 
imparting this spell into the caster’s brain, Eihort extracts 5 
POW in compensation.

Contact  Deity:  Nodens:  Opens  communication  with 
Nodens. The Contact spell for Nodens can be cast only from 
a remote, unpeopled place such as the edge of a sea-cliff. If, 
later, Nodens contacts the caster, it will be when he or she is 
alone and in a similar inaccessible place.
==========
Cost: 8 magic points

Contact Rat-Thing: To bring forth a foul rat-thing, it must 
be  cast  at  or  near  a  site  infested  by  rat-things.  A  popula-
tion  of  these  evil  creatures  reportedly  exists  in  Yorkshire, 
England.  Another  report  of  similar  creatures  comes  from

Cost: 2 magic points

Contact  Sand-Dweller:  Unless  there  are  no  sand-dwellers 
nearby, it succeeds automatically. The spell must be cast in 
a  suitable  desert,  such  as  in  the  Sahara,  the  southwestern 
United States, Saudi Arabia, or central Australia.

Cost: 3 magic points

Contact Servitor of the Outer Gods: A successful Luck roll

6 to 24 
hours

Vomiting, violent spasms, yellowish 
vision.
2D10 damage

Venom  destroys  tissue,  causing  necrosis,  al-
though rarely fatal (especially if antidote is given 
within 1 to 2 hours).

Rohypnol

15 to 30 
minutes

Unconsciousness for 4-8 hours, 
possible amnesia.
No damage.

Odorless, colorless and only available in modern 
game settings.

Strychnine

10 to 20

==========
The speed at which the poison acts is determined by the 
administration  method  and  Keeper  discretion.  Fast-acting 
poisons  begin  to  work  within  a  single  round  (death  from 
cyanide  poisoning  could  be  expected  within  a  minute,  for 
example).  Slower  poisons  may  take  hours  or  even  days  to 
register their effects.

Individual poisons cause a range of different symptoms, 
including stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, sweats, 
cramps, jaundice, altered heart rate, impaired vision, convul-
sions, unconsciousness and paralysis. It is up to the Keeper 
whether the symptoms permit the victim to act or not, or 
to act with a penalty die or an increased level of difficulty.

Alongside  the  various  symptoms,  poisons  also  cause 

physical damage.

T  Very  Mild  poisons:  no  damage,  only  temporary 

unconsciousness.

T  Mild poisons: 1D10.

T  Strong poisons: 2D10.

T  Lethal poisons: 4D10.
==========
Arsenic

30 minutes 
to 24 hours

Burning pain, vomiting, violent 
diarrhea.
4D10 damage

Arsenic  poisoning  was  difficult  to  determine 
(hence its popularity as a tool for murder) until 
1836, when the Marsh Test was invented. 

Belladonna 
(deadly night-
shade)

Black Widow 
Spider Venom 
(latrotoxin)

2 hours to 2 
days

Rapid heartbeat, impaired vision, 
convulsions.
4D10 damage

One  of  the  most  toxic  plants  in  the  world; 
consumption  of  10-20  berries  by  an  adult  will 
probably cause death.

2 to 8 hours

Chills, sweats, nausea.

1D10 damage

Rarely causes death if medical treatment is pro-
vided.

Chloroform

1 round

Unconsciousness for 1 hour. 
No damage

Widely used an anesthetic in 1800-1900s, how-
ever a high strength toxic dose may cause death.

Cobra Venom

15 to 60 
minutes

Convulsions, respiratory failure.
4D10 damage

Curare

1 round

Muscular paralysis, respiratory 
failure.
4D10 damage.
==========
8D10

Being involved in a high-speed head-on collision, being hit by a 
train.

*Asphyxiation and Drowning: a CON roll should be made each round; once a CON roll is failed, damage is sustained each 
round thereafter until death or until the victim is able to breathe. If the character is in a state of physical exertion, a Hard success 
is required on the CON roll.
**Poisons: an Extreme CON roll will halve damage from poisons. Poisons may cause a variety of additional symptoms 
including: stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, sweats, cramps, jaundice, altered heart rate, impaired vision, convul-
sions, unconsciousness, and paralysis. It is up to the Keeper whether the symptoms permit the victim to act or not, or to 
act with a penalty die or an increased level of difficulty.

In certain circumstances, Keepers may allow a poison's effects to be shaken off if the CON roll is a critical success.

What is a Temporal Communicator?,It is an artifact that allows Yithians to communicate with entities that have contacted the artifact in time and space,13,"A Temporal Communicator is a device that allows a Yithian to communicate with individuals in different times and spaces. It is described in Document 0 as a straightforward device to operate, provided the investigator can understand and determine which carving turns it on.","When  power  is  switched  on,  the 

jewel begins to glow red. After a few 
minutes,  contact  is  established

T  If the investigator is acting quickly to deceive, con, or trick, the 

skill is Fast Talk.

When Used on Player Characters
Each player (normally) has only one investigator through which they 
act in the game; it would therefore not be fair to allow one player to 
dictate  the  actions  of  another  player’s  investigator.  However,  if  one 
player wishes to put pressure on another player’s investigator to do their 
bidding, they might use violence (combat rules) or their investigator’s 
social skills. The former could inflict damage and ultimately death; the 
latter is subtler.
==========
Time Gate

Cost: variable POW
Casting time: one hour per POW spent

Deeper Version
The  caster  may  elect  to  prepare  a  Gate  for  travel  by 
expending  the  necessary  magic  points  before  the 
journey. The Gate is thus primed and the next person 
stepping through the doorway is not required to pay 
the magic point cost, but will still need to sacrifice 1 
Sanity point.

Deeper Version
The  wizard  is,  through  the  use  of  diabolical  symbols 
and chants, able to create multi-pathway Time Gates—
thus one door may lead to more than one distant time 
or future. Only the caster knows which path leads to 
which time on entering the Gate. Those foolish enough 
to use the Gate unassisted by the caster will be unable 
to determine the correct path and could arrive at any 
of the times the Gate is keyed to (roll randomly). The 
process of creation remains the same.

chapter 13: artifacts and alien deviceshis  chapter  provides  a  selection  of  monsters, 
beasts, and alien beings for use within Call of 
Cthulhu. The chapter is divided into four sec-
tions, each focusing on a specific monster type: 
Cthulhu  Mythos  entities,  Cthulhu  Mythos 
gods, classic monsters, and beasts. The selection of monsters 
across the sections is not exhaustive—every horror fan can 
probably think of some terror not present. The ones here are 
those  found  in  the  most  important  stories,  frequently  ap-
pear in scenarios, or are commonly referred to. Many more 
can  be  found  in  the  Call  of  Cthulhu  supplement  Malleus 
Monstrorum, also from Chaosium.
==========
The spell brings a random member of the species, pre-
sumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be 
alone, or to be with no more than a small group, in order 
not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, 
it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, 
the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve.

If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only 
one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper 
may determine if several representatives arrive as a group.

There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather 
bargain with, or devour, the caster. It will have an alien moti-
vation; however, if further contact seems of advantage to both 
sides, then some interesting roleplaying may emerge.

As mentioned, each version of the spell requires certain 

conditions to be in place for it to work.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What characteristics are typically possessed by monsters and beasts?,"STR, CON, SIZ, POW, INT, DEX",14,"STR, CON, SIZ, POW, INT, and DEX.","About the Entries
Most  monsters  and  entities  have  characteristics  including 
STR, CON, SIZ, POW, INT, and DEX. However many do not 
have an APP or EDU, since these qualities are meaningless 
in such alien and horrific creatures. Keepers have full reign 
to alter, modify, and rethink these entries. Lovecraft did not 
codify the monsters in his stories, so neither should you if 
you wish to present dramatically different versions.

These are creatures of nightmare, and individual mon-
sters may vary from one encounter to the next in their char-
acteristics  and  abilities.  The  characteristic  values  given  for 
each monster are those of an average specimen. As Keeper, 
you have the option to roll an individual monster’s statistics, 
or  choose  to  create  a  lesser  or  greater  specimen  using  the 
dice ranges as a guide to generating characteristic values.
==========
When involved in combat, consider the monster’s objec-
tive. If its aim is to kill the investigator, it should fight back 
rather than dodge. If it wants to escape from the investigators, 
it may choose to dodge in order to gain an opportunity to flee. 
Many Mythos monsters can use spells, casting them as any 
other spell caster would. In some cases a monster’s spell may be 
portrayed as a manifestation of that monster’s innate power. 

Monsters  may  not  have  skills  listed,  though  most  or 
all  might  have  a  few  skills  such  as  Listen,  Stealth,  or  Spot
==========
Each time you present a monster, present it afresh. Make 
the description intense and visceral. A deep one is never just 
a deep one. It is always a creature from the depths of the sea 
and  old  as  time  itself,  a  creature  whose  very  presence  hits 
you deep in the gut, repelling mankind in a profound man-
ner causing revulsion and nausea. Remember, it is never just 
a deep one.

Take this description of a hound of Tindalos:

“Out of the room’s corner jumps a hound of Tin-

dalos. It’s going to attack you...”

Perhaps we can do a little better:
“You  see  a  strange-looking  dog  appear  from  the 
corner of the room. Its eyes are yellow and its skin a 
pale blue color. It snarls evilly at you, rises on its hind 
legs and leaps towards you...”
==========
Intelligent  creatures  build,  experiment,  worship,  learn, 
perform  magic,  question,  torture,  or  do  anything  else  hu-
mans might do. They do much more as well; things that are 
odd, inexplicable, or incomprehensible. 

The horror, mystery and tone of the game are best served 
if behaviors are dark and unusual. The actions of such crea-
tures are beyond the imagination and you should strive to 
portray them as sinister, threatening, and unwholesome. 

The easy identification of a monster takes away mystery 
and reveals details about the plot. Don’t let investigators get 
information for free. If they get closer to the thing, it is still 
not  a  deep  one—it  is  a  dark,  wet  shape,  half-submerged, 
draped with seaweed, stinking like long-dead fish.

Section Four: Beasts
A comprehensive guide to all the varieties of animals

imals  listed  below  are  those  that  feature  as  foes  in 
stories of the horror genre (think of Hitchcock’s The 
Birds) or those that might be utilized by the investi-
gators (such as horses as mounts).

Bat, Large
The giant fruit bat of Central America congregates in doz-
ens or hundreds. The smaller bats common to the United 
States  gather  in  enormous  cavern-based  flocks  of 
up to 50,000 individuals. Bats worldwide are under 
severe environmental attack from humans.

What is the range of build value for a human?,From -2 to +2,14,"According to Document 1, the build value for a human ranges from -2 (children and small persons) to 2 (heavyweight boxers).","When considering what a being can 
lift or throw, use a standard human as 
a guide. The average human of Build 0 
could lift someone of equal build off the 
floor, perhaps carrying them over their 
shoulder. Something of 1 build smaller 
could  easily  be  lifted,  and  a  thing  of  2 
builds smaller could be thrown. With a 
strain, a human of Build 0 might just lift 
a person of Build 1. The most a person 
of Build 0 might do to a person of Build 
2 is to unbalance them or disarm them.
Using  this  as  a  guide,  it  becomes 
simple  to  figure  the  relative  capability 
of a monster to lift and throw things—
for example, whether a monster is large 
enough to throw a car.

Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy the town at night 
whose wizards are all ashes. For it is of old rumor that the 
soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his charnel clay, 
but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws; till out of 
corruption horrid life springs, and the dull scavengers of earth 
wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it. Great 
holes secretly are digged where earth’s pores ought to suffice, 
and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Festival

A crawling one is composed of thousands of worms and mag-
gots. Each worm is individually alive and constantly moves, 
though they generally hold the shape of a human body. The 
collective mass of wriggling creatures possesses the mind of 
a dead sorcerer, long since devoured by the maggoty horde. 
The ingested ""will"" of the wizard effectively drives the mass to 
work collectively to perform deeds and actions.

site. They’ve only been out three days and haven’t ventured 
far into the forest.

Brian  and  Arthur  Hall  went  deeper  into  the  forest  a 
couple of days back and haven’t been seen since. The Law-
sons have been keeping to the edge of the forest to look for 
deer, plus (Alistair says quietly) George was getting scared at 
night, so they pulled back to the wood’s edge.

The investigators are among the first groups to be shown 
to  their  starting  point:  the  scene  of  the  shoot-out  of  the 
previous night. The site is a newly formed clearing about a 
hundred yards across on the edge of the forest, forming part 
of a wider area marked for logging. A dirt track from the main 
road  heads  over  a  small  field  to  the  edge  of  the  clearing.  It 
is littered with short stumps and a couple of piles of fallen 
tree-trunks, surrounded by tall, looming trees that stand close

previous night: discarded shotgun shells and bullet casings;

Something  important  is  lost  by  an  investigator. 

Perhaps a rifle, propped against tree and forgotten.

The forest is full of hazards. An investigator might 
fall, be bitten by a snake or insect, suffer bad blisters, 
and so on. 

Day 2: The Truck
The posse stumbles across a trail of tire tracks that have cut 
through the forest floor. Given it’s snaking roughly north-
east, a successful Navigation roll can plot that the track is 
heading into the area north of Somerset. Anyone with local 
knowledge knows there are nothing but trees and the occa-
sional small lake there.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
