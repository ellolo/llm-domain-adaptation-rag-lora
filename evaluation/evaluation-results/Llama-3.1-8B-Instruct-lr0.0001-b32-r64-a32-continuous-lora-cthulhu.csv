Who wrote the Necronomicon chapter?,"The Necronomicon is a fictional book in the Cthulhu Mythos created by the American author H.P. Lovecraft. 

The Necronomicon is attributed to the Arab Abdul Al-hazred, who wrote it in the 12th century. However, the version that Lovecraft used as a reference was a translation by Dr. John Dee, an English mathematician, astronomer, and occultist, published in 1586. 

The Dee version is said to be a translation from the Greek of Theodoras Philetas, who in turn had translated it from the Arabic of Abdul Al-hazred. 

Other versions and partial translations of the Necronomicon are also mentioned, including a German translation by Ludwig Prinn, published in 1454 as the De Vermis Mysteriis. However, it is the version attributed to Dr. John Dee that is most often mentioned.

It is believed that the original Arabic version of the Necronomicon was called the Kitab Al Azif. It is said that the name Azif means ""book of the begining"" or ""book of the creation"". Al-Hazred was a human who lived in Arabia in the 12th century and who was a student"
What is the role of the Keeper in the Call of Cthulhu?,"In Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper is the game moderator, taking 
the role of narrator and arbiter of the rules. The Keeper is 
the person who creates and runs a scenario for the group of 
players. Essentially the Keeper is the ""game master"" of the 
saga, in charge of ensuring that the game runs smoothly and 
that everyone has a good time. 

The Keeper picks a scenario to run and prepares ade-
quate notes to ensure that he or she can present the story in 
a non-linear manner, one that will adapt to the actions of 
the players. The Keeper prepares two or three key encounters 
or locations that the group will encounter, but the exact way 
in which they reach these set pieces is left up to the players. 
The  Keeper  will  also  be  prepared  to  improvise  around 
the set pieces and respond to events that no one has predicted.

The  Keeper  will  also  be  responsible  for  running  the 
game smoothly, keeping track of all the various investigators, 
non-player characters and monsters, as well as their various 
skills,  powers  and  hit  points.  The  Keeper  is  also  respon"
What dices are needed to play Call of Cthulhu?,"To play Call of Cthulhu, you will need the following dice:

1.  Four  six-sided  dice  (D6),  one  of  which  is  a  1D6 
percentile die (noted as D6 or 1D6 on some dice). The stan-
dard  dice  found  in  most  game  stores  contain  the  numbers 
1 through 10 on one die and the numbers 11 through 20 on an-
other. When you buy dice for use with this game, make sure you 
get the right pair. 

1D4, 1D8, 1D10, 1D100: These are single dice. ‘D’ stands 
for ‘die’ and the number tells you how many-sided the die is. A 
1D6 die has six sides, a 1D8 die has eight sides and so on. A 
1D100 die has a hundred sides and is usually rolled by rolling a 
10-sided die and a 10-sided die and adding the numbers together 
(to get a result between 10 and 100).

2D6, 3D6, 4D6, etc.:"
How many dices are needed at a minimum to play the game?,"The minimum number of players for many roleplaying games is three; one person to play the role of Keeper (also known as a Game Moderator or 
Keeper of Arcane Lore) and two players to roleplay investigators. More players can join in as investigators. Some versions of games 
have different rules for team versus team play. 

It is not possible for there to be more than one player to take on the role of Keeper as the Keeper is the game moderator."
In which of Lovecraft's stories is featured the Miskatonic University?,"The Miskatonic University is featured in many of Lovecraft's stories, however it first appears in ""The Picture in the House"" (1920), but it is in ""The Dunwich Horror"" (1928) that it is established as a major institution of learning in New England, specializing in the study of antiques and, more 
famously, ancient and forbidden books. 

It is in ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"" (1940) that we learn the true extent of the university’s collection and its significance. 

The Miskatonic University is also used as the workplace of two of Lovecraft’s most famous characters, Dr. Armitage and 
Dr. Wheatcroft, the two being the respective heads of the university’s collections of ancient manuscripts and of the medical school. 

The Miskatonic University is also used as a place of study for the young Robert Blake in “The Haunter of the Dark” (1936). 
It is also used as the place of employment of Rev. Phillips, the man who is blackmailing Blake, as he is the university’s librarian.

The Miskatonic University is also used in “The Dreams in the Witch House” (1932) where the protagonist,"
What is the legacy of Lovecraft?,"The legacy of H.P. Lovecraft is immense and far-reaching, 
stretching from his contemporaries to the present day and 
spreading across many different forms of media. Lovecraft’s 
working-out of the Cthulhu Mythos has become the most 
famous and popular of all modern mythologies, and one of 
the most famous of all literary creations. 

 immediately  following  his  death,  his  stories  began  to 
attract a small but dedicated group of fans. It was not until 
the 1960s, however, that his reputation grew, thanks in part 
to the efforts of August Derleth, a contemporary of Lovecraf’t 
and  one  of  his  closest  friends.  Derleth  was  instrumental 
in  creating  the  Mythos  as  we  know  it  today,  both  by 
writing his own stories and by posthumously collaborating with 
Lovecraft. He also founded Arkham House Publishing, the first 
to print Lovecraft’s works, and helped to ensure the perpetua-
tion of the Cthulhu Mythos for a new generation of fans.

What are the steps to create an investigator?,"Creating an investigator is a fun and exciting part of playing the Call of Cthulhu game. Here are the steps to create an investigator:

Step 1: Decide on an Era
The  era  in  which  your  investigator  is  born  and  operates 
can  be  important  in  defining  the  period  in  which  they  are 
most active. The era also defines what skills may be of use to 
the investigator. For example, in the 1920s, knowledge of the 
French language and 1920s (or Modern) Firearms skill would 
be of no use to the investigator, whereas in the Modern day, 
these would be important skills. 

Step 2: Generate Characteristics
Seven  characteristics  are  generated  for  each  investigator: 
Strength, Constitution, Size, Intelligence, Power, Dex-
terity, and Appearance. Two more are chosen from the 
other categories of characteristic. The player then rolls for 
these nine characteristics. Characteristics determine the basic 
capabilities of an investigator. 

Step 3: Decide an Occupation
An occupation shows how an investigator earns a living, and 
also provides a social class. An occupation also provides a 
range of"
What modifiers should a player apply for a character that is 70 year old?,"In many roleplaying games, 70 is considered an old person. 
The  exact  modifiers  will  depend  on  the  specific  rules  of 
the game being played, but here are some common ones:

  •  CON  and  SIZ  rolls  should  be  set  to  15  or  less,  or 
reduced by 1 or 2 to reflect a decline in physical fitness and 
strength.

  •  APP  may  be  raised  by  1  or  2  to  reflect  a  more 
world-weary and jaded outlook.

  •  EDU  may  be  raised  by  1  or  2  to  reflect  the  time 
taken to complete a full education in the distant past.

  •  Move  should  be  reduced  by  1  or  2  to  reflect  a  de-
cline in physical fitness.

  •  If  the  investigator’s  current  occupation  does  not  in-
corporate  any  physical  activity,  and  is  a  non-physical  skill 
such as Accountancy or History"
How can a player increase weapons skills?,"In most roleplaying games, weapon skills can be improved through use and practice. Here are some general methods that may be 
applicable to your game:

i  Practice:  Using  the  weapon  successfully  in  a  combat  yields  experience  points  and  a  rise  in  skill.  Each  use 
of the skill in play is a chance to gain experience points and increase the skill. A player may not put dice rolls for skill 
increase on the dice roll for using a weapon in combat (see Firearms, page 112).

i  Training:  A  combat  specialization  skill  (such  as  Fighting  or  Firearms)  may  be  improved  with  a  successful 

Climb skill roll. 

i  Hard  use:  any  use  of  a  weapon  in  a  way  other  than  its  intended  purpose.  For  example,  using  a  knife 
to  pry  open  a  tightly  jammed  door  or  using  a  shotgun  to  blast  open  a  door  (as  opposed  to  using  the 
Brawl skill to bash"
"Given a specific skill, what is the range of skill points for an investigator at the Amateur level?","In the main, the skill points for an investigator at the Amateur level will be between 15 and 75. 

Amateur  (15%)  to  Regular  (50%)  skill  points  represent 
the lowest to average skill levels. An investigator with skills in 
this range is an amateur in the field of skill, e.g. someone who 
has only recently picked up a camera, or has only just started 
to pick up and use a firearm.

Regular (50%) to Hard (90%) skill points represent an inter-
mediate skill level. An investigator with a skill in this range has 
some experience of the skill, perhaps enough to allow them to 
use it in a professional capacity. This would be a highly trained

Call of Cthulhuhuman would be an expert. An investigator would need to have 
a skill of 90% or more to be considered an expert. 

G  Hard: above the Hard difficulty level. This task would 

challenge an expert.

G  Extreme: above the Extreme difficulty level. This task 

would challenge a master.

The  Keeper  may  not  always  be  able  to  accurately  gauge 
the difficulty of a given situation, especially if it"
What is the hypnosis skill?,"The Hypnosis skill in roleplaying games is typically used to 
gauge the success or failure of an attempt to hypnotize or sug-
gest to an individual, whether it be to influence a non-player 
character in the game or to keep an investigator under control. 
It is up to the player whether an investigator is aware of being 
hypnotized or not. If the player is unaware, the investigator 
may act out of character, allowing the player to take control 
for a while. This can be a dramatic way to shift control to the 
Keeper for a short time. The player regains control when he or 
she either wakes up or when prompted to do so by the Keeper. 
Amnesia  and  insanity  can  cause  an  investigator  to  lose  all 
memory of the skill Hypnosis, as well as of everything else.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
There is no Hypnosis skill, this is a skill that is used to set the 
difficulty level for Hypnosis rolls. As with all Intimidate, Per-
suade and Charm skills, the difficulty level of a Hypnosis roll 
is never beyond the character’s skill level. 

i  Regular  difficulty:  standard  hyp"
Who decides the difficulty level of a skill roll?,"The Keeper sets the difficulty level of a skill roll. 

The player declares their intention and then the Keeper decides 
whether the difficulty level should be Regular, Hard, or Extreme. 
The Keeper should not allow a player to dictate the difficulty 
level of a skill roll. 

The Keeper should consider the difficulty level in relation to 
the story and the current situation in the game. If the player is 
attempting to use a skill to achieve something that is easily 
possible according to the skill’s description, then the difficulty 
level should be Regular. If the request is for something just aboVe 
the skill’s level of achievement then the difficulty level should 
be Hard. If the request is for something that exceeds the skill’s 
level of achievement, even for an expert, then the difficulty 
level should be Extreme. 

If the Keeper feels that it should be impossible for a char-
acter to achieve something, he or she should block the attempt 
rather than setting a difficulty level of Extreme. 

The skill level of the opposing character is not always as 
indicated by the skill percentage. When an investigator is op-
posing someone with an occupation skill, the Keeper should 
use the opponent’s skill in a different way. The Keeper should

What are the consequences of a successful Pushed Roll?,"When  a  skill  roll  is  pushed,  the  consequence  of  failure  is 
always  negative.  The  negative  consequence  of  a  pushed  roll 
should  be  significant  to  the  game;  an  investigator  is  normally 
only  pushed  to  make  a  roll  if  the  Keeper  thinks  the  outcome 
is  unlikely;  therefore  the  consequence  of  failure  should  be 
more  than  mere  failure—the  Keeper  should  aim  to  create  a 
more dramatic outcome for the player. 

When a player wins a pushed roll, no additional consequence 
of failure is applied and the Keeper should reward the success as 
usual.

When an investigator fails a pushed roll, the Keeper should 
always consider the following options:

G  Increase the danger or difficulty level of the situation for 

the investigator (perhaps other investigators can offer no 

help).

G  Inflict physical harm: the Keeper should determine some 
form of  damage  (see  Table  XVII:  Weapons,  page 
401-405, or 1D3 to 2D6 damage, page 122"
What happens when a player must use more than one skill?,"When  a  player  is  required  to  use  more  than  one  skill  to 
complete  a  task,  the  Keeper  should  ask  for  a  roll  for  each 
required skill. The difficulty level for each skill roll is determined 
individually. The Keeper starts by setting the difficulty level for 
each of the skill rolls, and then uses the higher of the two dif-
ficulty levels for the challenge roll.

When the skill levels are opposed, the Keeper will set two dif-
ficulty levels: one for each of the opposing skill rolls. Whichever 
difficulty level is higher will be used for the opposed roll.

An  investigator  is  attempting  to  pick  a  lock  and  at  the 
same time keep watch out for any lurking enemies. The player 
rolls  14  for  Locksmith,  a  Regular  success.  She  rolls  12 
for Spot Hidden, a Regular success. Since neither roll was a 
Hard  or  Extreme  success,  the  difficulty  level  for  both  was 
Regular, so the challenge was not difficult and she has not lost 
any points. The player"
What are the optional rules of the game system?,"I'm not actually a game moderator, and I don't know the specific game system you are referring to. I can tell you about some common optional rules found in some 
mainstream games, but this will depend on the game you are playing. 

Cash and Assets:  The  standard  rules  are  usually  sufficient. 
However, if you wish to incorporate more complexity, you might 
consider allowing the players to spend their cash however they 
like (within reason), and record the remaining amount. This is 
how they wish to allocate their funds. 

Movement Rate:  The  standard  rules  use  a  movement  rate 
of  8  movement  actions.  Some  characters,  such  as  vehicles, 
have  a  movement  rate  that  is  a  multiple  of  the  average 
human. These characters are capable of actions that normal 
humans could not achieve. 

Vehicular Collisions: When a vehicle suffers a major 
wound (an amount of damage equal to or greater than half 
the  vehicle’s  build),  it  is  involved  in  an  accident  or 
collision. This may cause loss of control, a wheel"
What is a Combat Round?,"In a tabletop roleplaying game, a combat round is a specific period 
of game time during which each participant gets a chance to act. 
It is a discrete unit of time, usually one second, in which one 
character performs some form of action. 

A combat round is over when everyone who wishes to act in 
the next round has had their turn. The combat round is usually 
initiated with a ""combat round marker"" or ""initiative marker"", 
a  token  or  marker  that  is  moved  around  the  combat  to 
indicate which player is acting at any given time. Some groups 
use a timer or a number of dice rolls to determine the length 
of each combat round.

Characters  and  monsters  get  a  number  of  actions  in 
each combat round. An action is a significant event such as at-
tacking, casting a spell, running from the room, picking a lock, 
etc. Some creatures are capable of more actions in a single round 
than others. Some creatures, such as those that fly, get an addi-
tional number of actions per round for each point they are above 
their usual DEX order.

"If more than one combatants want to attack, who has the right to attack first?","In a melee combat, where more than one character wishes to attack, the initiative order is determined in the following manner.

Characters act in DEX order, highest to lowest. If characters are 
draw then the one with the highest STR has priority.

Read  through  all  the  intentions  for  combat  on  both  sides. 
Determine who is going first and how many actions they get.

Allow each character on both sides of the conflict a chance to 
declare what actions they intend to make. 

Allow each character with a declared action to make a skill roll 
or  a  damage  roll.  Resolve  each  skill  roll  and  damage  roll. 
Allow each character with a declared action to make a skill roll 
or a damage roll. 

Once all characters with declared actions have made their moves, 
allow those with firearms to make a fire shot (see Firearms, Multiple 
Shots page 113).

Once all characters with declared actions have made their moves 
and any firearms have been used, allow those with declared actions 
to make a melee attack.

Allow those with declared actions the opportunity to dodge, dive 
for cover, or perform a fighting maneuver (see page 106).

Allow those with declared actions"
In which situation is a character allowed to escape a close combat?,"A character can break free from a grapple or other form of 
restraint or close combat on their turn in the DEX order, 
provided they win a opposed STR vs. STR roll. If the character 
being held uses an attack (of any kind) on their attacker, this 
will  automatically  break  the  hold  or  restraints  on  them,  but 
they will still be in the same location. If they achieve a greater 
level of success in the opposed roll than their attacker, they are 
free and their attacker is held. If both fail, the hold or restraints 
remains in place.

A character can also break out of restraints or a hold on their 
turn  in  the  DEX  order  by  using  an  appropriate  Fighting, 
Brawl or Maneuver skill. The use of firearms requires a skill 
roll and is at the Keeper’s discretion.

A  character  is  physically  able  to  do  something  to  break 
free, such as lifting their own body weight or that of their op-
ponent. The use of tools, such as bolt cutters or an angle-grinder 
to cut through restraints, may take"
How is a firearm attack resolved?,"In most cases, resolving a firearm attack using the standard combat 
rules is all that is required. The attacker declares the type of fire 
they are using (e.g. full auto, single shot, burst, etc.) on their 
attack  declaration  and  states  the  number  of  bullets  they  are 
shooting before rolling the dice. The number of bullets fired is the 
number  of  7.62mm  rounds  fired  from  a  AKM/M16,  for  ex-
ample,  but  would  be  four .30-06  rounds  when  firing  a  bolt-
action rifle or five.45-70 Government rounds when firing a lever-
action rifle. 

T  If  the  attacker  achieves  a  higher  level  of  success  than 
the  target’s  DEX,  the  number  of  bullets  fired  is  reduced 
by one. If this would reduce the number of bullets to one, it 
is reduced to one (a roll of 1 will still be made, but there will 
only be one bullet to fire).

T  If the attacker achieves a level of success equal to or"
How does a character recover from a major wound when the Major Wound box is checked?,"In Call of Cthulhu, when a character receives a Major Wound, 
the character immediately falls prone and loses hit points equal to 
the number of points of damage inflicted by the attack. The 
character’s  condition  is  checked  immediately  after  a  Major 
Wound  and  again  at  the  end  of  the  round  (if  fighting 
hand-to-hand), or when they take their next damage roll (if 
not fighting hand-to-hand). 

If  the  character’s  Luck  is  not  spent  to  stabilize  them, 
they die. Alternatively, if the character falls unconscious and 
no one performs First Aid on them, they will die and must 
be  buried  or  cremated  (by  their  friends,  perhaps,  or  the 
Keeper). A dying character is not in control of their actions, 
and whether they live or die is in the hands of their players. 

A  character  is  stable  when  recovering  from  a  Major 
Wound.  No  dice  rolls  are  required  for  the  recovery  of 
stabilized  patients.  Stabil"
Can you provide a short description of how a Chase takes place?,"A  chase  in  your  story  or  game  will  probably  involve  a  mix-
ture of characters, some on foot and others in vehicles. The 
characters in the chase are divided into two groups: those that 
are trying to catch the others (the pursuers) and those that are 
trying to escape (the fleeing characters). 

The Keeper starts by ranking all the characters in the chase 
in order of their MOV, from slowest to fastest. The order may 
change as characters lose or gain locations during the chase. 

A chase takes place in rounds, with each participant getting 
a turn in the order of their rank. A character’s turn ends when 
they have acted, not when the other characters have finished. 
There is no pause in the action for discussion or for the Keeper 
to  decide  what  happens  when  another  character  acts.  The 
action is fast moving and fluid, with each character’s action 
triggering the next.

A combat round is over when the person who initiated the 
last attack has finished fighting back. Note that some characters 
may have more than one attack, such as a character with a 
gun in each hand, or a monster with multiple"
What is a speed roll used for during a chase?,"In a chase, a speed roll is used to establish the order of movement. 
All participants make a skill roll: CON (for human characters) or 
the appropriate characteristic (for monsters and non-player charac-
ters); the one with the highest roll goes first, and so on. If there 
is a tie, the side with the higher DEX goes first. If still a tie, the 
sides re-roll, each rolling a penalty die. If there is still a tie after 
this, the characters/monsters can be said to have converged on the 
same location, and should be developed into different characters or 
some should be given a penalty die to determine the order.

Once the order of movement has been determined, each char-
acter/monster gets a turn to act. On his or her turn, a character 
may  move  and  then  perform  1  melee  attack  or  1  ranged 
attack, or perform a fighting maneuver. Certain monsters, such 
as those with multiple attacks listed, are able to make multiple 
attacks in one round. Note that some monsters and characters 
may have abilities that allow them to make an additional attack 
as a bonus action (see page 108).

"
How many movements can a chase participant take per round?,"In a chase, each participant gets a number of movement actions equal to their MOV rating. Characters with the same MOV rating get the same number of movement actions, but do not act in the same round unless they wish to, as faster characters will act first. 

In the 7th Edition rules, a character can spend 1 movement action to move 1 location. Thus, a character with MOV 8 can move a maximum of 8 locations in 1 round. 

A character can also use a number of movement actions equal to their MOV rating to fight back or perform a fighting maneuver. 

A character can move a number of locations equal to their MOV rating minus the number of movement actions they use for fighting maneuvers or fighting back. 

Thus, if an investigator has MOV 8 and uses 3 movement actions to fight back, he or she may move back 5 locations (8-3 = 5). 

If an investigator has no movement actions left, he or she may still be able to fight back on their current location. 

G  If  the  attacker  moves  into  melee  combat,  they 
initiate a fighting maneuver and resolve it as for any 
other fighting maneuver. If the maneuver is successful,

What methods can the Keeper use to create obstacles and hazards during a chase?,"As Keeper, you have a range of options available to you when creating obstacles and hazards during a chase. 

G  An  open  door  swing  open  and  throw  the  inves-
tigator out of the house. 

G  A  locked  door  may  slow  an  investigator  down  for  a 
brief moment, but it will not stop a determined attacker. 

G  A  window  that  can  be  broken  with  one  successful 

Brawl roll.

G  A fence that can be climbed with one successful Climb roll.

G  A  locked  car  door  that  can  be  opened  with  one 
successful Locksmith or Mechanical Repair roll.

G  A  high  fence  that  cannot  be  climbed  without  the 
use of tools or specialized equipment.

G  A  door  that  is  locked  with  specialized  security 

locks.

G  A  window  that  is  barred  or  made  of  shatterproof 
material.

G  A  locked  filing  cabinet  or  strongbox.  The  difficulty 
level may be increased if the lock is high security"
How are vehicle damages computed after a collision?,"In  most  cases,  damage  to  a  vehicle  is  figured  using  1D10 
plus  the  driver’s  skill  (Drive  Auto,  Ride,  Pilot,  or  as  the 
Keeper  sees  fit).  The  Keeper  should  figure  the  damage  as 
though  to  a  barrier  (see  Striking  through  Barriers,  page 
147), substituting vehicle build for the attacker’s build. The 
result  is  the  number  of  points  of  damage  the  vehicle 
inflicts. 

A  vehicle  is  treated  as  a  barrier  that  can  be  broken 
through by another vehicle. The Keeper should decide on a 
level of difficulty for the maneuver, based on the build of the 
vehicles involved. If the opponent’s build is 3 or more points 
above that of the attacking vehicle, the maneuver is impossible. 

The  Keeper  should  decide  whether  a  maneuver  can 
be made against a vehicle that is larger than the attacker. The 
opponent may be able to absorb some impact, but is more 
likely to"
What state of insanity exist in the game?,"In the game of Call of Cthulhu, an investigator can go insane, 
and when he or she does so they experience a bout of madness. 
A bout of madness lasts for 1D10 combat rounds (real time) 
and then ends. While experiencing a bout of madness, the player 
of the investigator has no control over the investigator’s actions. 
The Keeper decides what happens during the bout of madness, 
whether it is delusional activity or actual physical action, and 
may even allow the investigator to act in a way that might nor-
mally result in sanity loss or other negative consequences. 

There is no physical attack that can cause harm during a 
bout of madness, although the investigator may still die as a re-
sult of a physical attack. The investigator does not suffer further 
sanity loss during a bout of madness, nor can the Sanity roll 
be pushed.

Bouts of madness can take one of two forms: either the in-
vestigator’s mind is disconnected from their body, or their mind 
is fully in control of their body but is perceiving its surroundings 
in a disordered way.

First, the investigator’s mind is disconnected from their body: 
the investigator falls unconscious and their body"
How many Sanity points must an investigator loose to become temporary insane?,"An investigator must lose 5 or more Sanity points in a single day, or a total of 1D10 Sanity points in a few days, to become temporarily insane. If the Sanity loss is from a single Sanity roll, then the investigator becomes temporarily insane if the roll is equal to or greater than the investigator's current Sanity points. 

Note:  The  investigator  is  not  required  to  make  a  Sanity 
roll for every Mythos-related event; only significant events, as 
determined by the Keeper, require a Sanity roll.

The effects of temporary insanity last for 1D10 hours.

Alternatively,  an  investigator  might  go  temporarily  insane 
as the direct result of a Sanity roll; this is up to the Keeper to 
determine. The Keeper may call for a Sanity roll when an in-
vestigator is exposed to some horrific event, situation or sight. 
If  the  roll  fails,  the  investigator  goes  temporarily  insane. 
Equally, if an investigator loses all their Sanity points (a state 
known as ""mythos insanity""), they become temporarily insane, 
losing all knowledge of the real world and becoming unaware of 
their own identity. Everything known"
How is it decided how many hours temporary insanity lasts?,"In Call of Cthulhu, the duration of temporary insanity is deter-
mined randomly by rolling on Table VIII-1: Bouts of Madness—
Summary (see page  239).  Each  bout  of  madness  has  a  de-
gree of intensity that determines how long the bout of madness 
lasts. 

Alternatively,  the  Keeper  may  choose  to  use  the  optional 
""Monsters, Mania and Insanity"" rules (see page 154).

walls of the edifice…Something was wrong, something was 
wrong in the angles, the curves, the very lines of the place. 
It was not natural. Anything not natural was evil.

—August Derleth, The Dweller in Darkness

In  the  world  of  the  Cthulhu  Mythos,  magic  is  a  manip-
ulation  of  the  universe  and  everything"
What is the best way to recover from Indefinite Insanity?,"Recovery from indefinite insanity can take a long time, and is different for each investigator. 

First, the investigator's background is checked for any entries under the ""In-
sanity"" section. Any such entries are erased. Then the player makes a Sanity 
roll, and if the roll is successful, the investigator recovers 1D10 Sanity points. 
This is followed by an Intelligence roll. If the Intelligence roll is successful, the 
investigator  has  fully  recovered  and  any  delusions  and  hallucinations 
come to an end. If the Intelligence roll is failed, the investigator has not re-
covered and one or more of the ""Phobia"" or ""Mania"" boxes should be ticked. 
The investigator is still insane and will require 1D10 days of treatment before 
a Sanity roll can be made to determine if recovery is possible. 

During  the  next  1D10  days,  the  investigator  will  visit  places  of 
solace and engage in their main hobby. If the investigator’s player can 
make a successful Sanity roll, the investigator has recovered. If not, the 
investigator has not recovered and the process of roleplaying the delu"
How many language skill ticks should be awarded when an investigator conducts a full study of a tome in that language?,"When  an  investigator  completes  a  full  study  of  a  tome, 
they should gain a number of language skill ticks equal to the 
Cthulhu Mythos rating of the tome. This will up their Cthulhu 
Mythos knowledge and also increase their Cthulhu Mythos skill. 
No tick is given for a translation. 

A  hard  or  full  study  of  a  tome  is  not  required  to  ex-
tract  unusual  information  or  to  identify  a  particular  spell. 
Reading  a  tome  is  a  variable  rate  of  progress;  knowledgeable 
readers  will  read  quickly  and  less  knowledgeable  readers  will 
read slowly. 

A  person  well-versed  in  the  language  of  the  book  will  be 
familiar with the subject matter and can expect to learn more, but 
may not need to make a reading roll. A person who does not know 
the language can attempt to translate the book by making an initial 
Cthulhu Mythos roll, as mentioned earlier. Unless the book is in 
English"
How can a character learn a spell?,"In the world of roleplaying, learning a spell can be a 
various  and  unpredictable  affair.  Here  are  a  few  pos-
sibilities, depending on the scenario and story you are running. 
Remember that these are just suggestions and that your group will 
develop its own traditions and preferences.

Learning a Spell from a Book
A  spell  is  to  be  found  in  a  book  that  is  at  least  1D6 
Mythos  Book  points  higher  than  the  caster’s  Cthulhu 
Mythos skill. The Keeper should adjust the study time accor-
dingly. A person can spend as much time as they want studying 
a book, but will get no Cthulhu Mythos skill increase unless 
they study for 1D6 weeks or more. 

Learning a Spell from Another Person
Sometimes  a  written  copy  of  a  spell  is  not  available,  or 
perhaps the caster wishes to learn the full nuances of a spell as 
cast by another. To learn a spell from another person, the same 
roll is made as for reading a book, using the"
What type of roll must a player do to cast a spell?,"In roleplaying games, to cast a spell the player must make a 
Sanity roll (if the spell costs Sanity points) and also a roll for 
the skill used by the spell. If the spell costs magic points it must 
also be paid for. Many spells have other requirements, such as 
the need for certain items or for the caster to have reached a 
certain location. Each spell has its own unique set of con-
ditions that must be met before it can be cast successfully.

The player should be given enough information about the 
spell to determine if the caster is in a suitable location, has 
the required items and has overcome any other external cir-
cumstances that might prevent the spell from being cast. In 
general, the player should be blocked from casting a spell only 
as a result of an active opposition or as a result of some 
other event or action, such as running out of magic points 
or sanity.

The caster’s intention is important, and must be clearly 
stated.  The  caster  might  well  want  to  use  the  spell  of 
Create Zombie as a way of opening a door without breaking 
it down, or to get rid of a hostile intruder. The"
What happens when a spell casting roll fails?,"When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  pushed  and  failed,  the  caster 
must immediately pay the full Magic point and Sanity point cost of 
the spell. Nothing happens.

When a spell casting roll is failed on the first attempt, the caster 
may not re-roll the casting roll. A failed casting roll is a failed 
casting roll regardless of how high the skill or POW involved might 
be. The caster should always check the Sanity point cost and Magic 
point cost of the spell before casting it. If the Sanity point cost for 
a spell is 0, the caster cannot lose more Sanity points for failing the 
casting roll. If the Magic point cost is 0, the caster cannot lose more 
Magic points for failing the casting roll. 

If  the  caster  fails  the  pushed  casting  roll,  the  caster  may 
choose to continue the spell casting attempt on the following round 

and on subsequent rounds until the spell is successfully cast or cast-
ing is abandoned. The caster must spend Magic points and Sanity 
points in the cost of the spell on each attempt. The caster cannot 
push the casting of a spell.

Becoming a Believer

An investigator can become a believer"
What information is advised that the Keeper gives to the players before they create their investigators?,"When starting a game of Call of Cthulhu, it is advised that the Keeper provides the players with some background information on the period in which the game is set. This is usually done to encourage the players to 
keep their period setting knowledge in mind when generating their investigators. 

The players are encouraged to ask questions about the setting to the Keeper. The Keeper should try to give out as little information as possible, feeding the players just enough information to keep them interested and 
motivated. The players will pick up on what you are giving them verbally, so be sure to keep control of non-player characters and the world around the players’ investigators. 

When the players have decided on their investigators, the Keeper should take a close look through the investigator sheets, 
reading  what  each  player  has  written  about  their  investigator’s  backstory,  goals,  and  motivations.  The  Keeper 
should  also  note  down  any  other  important  information  that  the  player  has  written  down  on  the  investigator 
sheet or on a separate piece of paper for later reference. 

The  Keeper  should  also  read  the  scenario  through  again  and "
What are NPCs?,"NPC  stands  for  Non-Player  Character.  In  roleplaying 
games,  such  as  Dungeons  &  Dragons,  the  players  control 
their  investigator  characters,  while  the  Keeper  (usually  the 
person who is running the game) controls everyone else, known 
as non-player characters. Non-player characters can be anyone 
the players meet during the game—shopkeepers, cultists, mon-
sters, or even the police. 

You may also refer to the Investigators as “the investigators” 
and  non-player  characters  as  “NPCs”.  Think  of  “NPC”  as 
an abbreviation for “non-player character”. 

Using the Rules
The rules in this book are intended to be flexible enough to 
cope with all manner of games and scenarios, and to allow 
Keepers to run the game in a way that suits their personal 
preference.  The  rules  are  presented  in  a  logical  and  or-
derly fashion, attempting to group related items together in a 
rational manner. 

The rules are divided into a number of tomes, each con-
centrating on a particular aspect of the"
What is an Idea Roll?,"In roleplaying games, an Idea Roll is a dice roll used to determine the 
outcome of a player’s suggestion for how their investigator’s goal 
might be achieved. The roll is usually made using the Idea roll 
(50%) skill. 

An  Idea  Roll  is  used  to  test  whether  the  investigator’s 
improvised action is believable. If the roll is failed, some alter-
native  explanation  for  the  event  must  be  made.  An  Idea  Roll 
is different from a regular skill roll in that it is not opposed by 
an  opponent.  Instead  the  Keeper  will  determine  a  difficulty 
level for the roll. The skill used for Idea rolls is usually either In-
telligence or Charm, depending on the situation and the char-
acter’s motivation.

An  Idea  roll  is  most  commonly  used  in  combat  when 
the player describes an action for their investigator that is not 
one of the standard combat actions (fight back, dodge, feint, 
flee,  surrender,  or  nothing  [holding  fire]—see  page  103). 
The player would normally be encouraged"
What are the Mythos Tomes,"A dread subject. The Mythos Tomes are a series of ancient, 
mysterious  books  (many  of  them  ancient  and  in  foreign 
languages) that describe the Mythos of the Cthulhu Mythos 
fiction of H.P. Lovecraft and his followers. These tomes are 
typically  written  by  those  who  have  had  firsthand  experi-
ence of the cosmic horror of the Cthulhu Mythos, and who 
have (in the main) paid the ultimate price in doing so. Few 
human  men  and  women  can  even  hope  to  survive  read-
ing a Mythos tome, let alone comprehend its dark secrets.

There are thousands of tomes of the Mythos and only a small 
sample is presented here. Keepers are advised to add to these 
lists as they wish and have inclination.

What is the Mythos rating of the Celaeno Fragments?,I'm not familiar with that term. Could you provide more context or clarify what you are referring to?
When was the Key of Solomon written?,"The  authorship  and  exact  date  of  writing  of  the  Key  of 
Solomon  are  unknown.  It  is  traditionally  attributed  to  King 
Solomon of Israel, who is believed to have composed it in the 
10th century BC, however most scholars consider it to be a medieval 
work, possibly written in the 14th or 15th century AD. 

The five versions of the Key known to exist all appear to be 
manuscripts,  with  the  Black  Goat  of  the  Woods  version  in 
English,  the  others  in  Latin,  Greek,  French  and  German,  respectively. 
The version in English is the most complete, but the version in Greek 
is in better condition. 

The  grimoire  is  a  leather  binding  that  has  been  oiled  and 
stained over the years, giving it a rich, dark look. The cover is thick 
and  rigid,  and  is  embossed  with  a  strange  design  that  can  be 
best described as a knot or a serpentine pattern. 

"
What are the main spell classes?,"In the main, spells in the Call of Cthulhu game are classed as 
Mythos or Non-Mythos. 

Non-Mythos spells can be found in the Grimoire at the back 
of this book and in certain Mythos tomes. They are organized 
alphabetically by name. Each spell has a cost in magic points, 
Sanity points (if appropriate), and POW that must be factored 
into the character’s build. Learning a spell may take weeks, a 
month or more. The Keeper decides on the time required. The 
study of a tome is an important factor and can add greatly to 
the learning time. The player figures the time it will take to 
study a tome by multiplying the study weeks by 5 (or simply 
using the reading roll to gauge the time). Learning a spell from 
another person generally takes twice as long as reading a book. 
The Keeper may increase or decrease these times as desired.

Learning a spell from another person is a dangerous busi-
ness;  there  is  always  the  risk  that  the  student  might  get 
carried away and use the spell before they have fully mastered 
it—perhaps with disastrous"
How long does a Banishment of Yde Etad spell last at minimum?,"A very obscure question! Banishment of Yde Etad is a spell in the  
Malleus Maleficarum and the Book of Eibon. I do not have 
any information on this spell in my general knowledge. However, 
I can suggest some possibilities. 

A successful casting would surely banish the target for a month 
at least, and possibly forever. A minimum of 7 magic points and 
a week of preparation by the caster are assumed. A dice roll to 
set an ending date for the banishment could be made, similar 
to a Contact Deity spell. A successful roll might mean the banis-
hment lasts for 1D10 weeks, or perhaps longer. 

An investigator can attempt to lift a banishment any time after 
the magic points have been expended. A successful POW roll to 
withstand the Banishment will allow the investigator to attempt 
a Hard POW roll to leave the area within 1D10 rounds. There 
is also a 5% chance per magic point spent that the spell will 
be  foiled  by  unseen  forces,  causing  1D10  hit  points  damage 
to  everyone  within  10  yards,  including"
What is the cost of a Bless Blade?,"I don't have any information about a ""Bless Blade"". Could you provide more context or information about what a Bless Blade is? Is it a magical weapon perhaps?"
Which spell can a cultist use to get in touch with alien races?,"There are several options, depending on the cultist’s knowledge and goals. 

Contact Deep One: The cultist tries to contact deep ones. The spell 
must be cast at a coastline, sea-loch, or other saltwater lake. The 
casters must have a deck of tarot cards and a book on the magic 
of Dagon. As the cultists dance around the alter, they draw cards 
from the deck, each one representing an organ of the body. For 
example, the Eight of Cups might represent the kidneys, the Five 
of Swords the little finger of the left hand, and so on. Once the 
organ is identified, it is removed from the caster’s body and its 
functions suspended. The organ is then placed in the body of the 
shoggoth, to be controlled by the caster. While in the shoggoth’s 
body, the caster takes on the appearance of the creature. The 
caster can now move about and perform actions, able to with-
stand the elements and any harm, except direct damage to the 
human brain, which would kill the caster. The brain can be 
removed from the shoggoth-body at will and can survive for 
a while outside of it."
Who uses Carotid Toxin?,"I'm not aware of any mainstream information regarding ""Carotid Toxin"". It's possible it could be something home-brew or from a specific source, such as a particular scenario or campaign, or perhaps an amateur attempt to create a new poison."
What is a Temporal Communicator?,"I don't have any information on what a temporal communicator is. 
Could you please provide more context and information regarding 
this term? I can try to help you to determine its meaning. 

(If you wish, I can generate some possible meanings, or you 
may wish to call for a Cthulhu Mythos or Mythos-Babble roll 
to provide a random definition)."
What characteristics are typically possessed by monsters and beasts?,"In  the  main,  monsters  and  beasts  have  the  following 
characteristics,  other  characteristics  being  made  up  during 
character creation to fit the Keeper’s requirements.

G  STR:  75%  or  more  indicates  a  large  creature;  50% 
to  74%  indicates  a  normal  human  build;  33%  to  49% 
indicates  a  small  person  or  child;  1%  to  32%  indicates 

Monster Characteristics
A monster’s characteristics should be proportional to those of a 
humanity.  The  characteristics  of  a  monster  should  be  de-
termined by the Keeper, taking into account the monster’s size. 
The following are some guidelines for characteristic values in mon-
sters of different sizes. These are only guidelines and the Keeper 
should feel free to make adjustments as needed.

In 7th Edition, characteristics are all multiplied by 5, so the 
values given here are the one-fifth values. 

Large human: STR 40 to 60, SIZ 50 to 90
Average human: STR"
What is the range of build value for a human?,"In many roleplaying games, the build is a characteristic that denotes 
the physical size and strength of a character. The build of a human 
can vary from 0 to 6, though it is rare to find a human with a 
build of 0 or 6. A build of 0 would imply a child or frail person, 
while a build of 6 would imply someone of enormous muscle mass, 
far beyond human scale. 

In the game, the build of a character determines the amount of 
damage they are able to inflict with a Fighting attack. Each build 
point is equal to 1D6 damage. A character with a build of 1 can 
inflict a maximum of 1D6 damage, while a giant with a build of 
6 could inflict 1D6 x 6 = 6D6 damage with a single blow.

In combat, a character’s Build is used in a number of ways. 
When attacking, a character’s Build determines the damage they 
deal.  A  character  is  assumed  to  be  using  their  basic  Fighting 
skill when using a melee weapon, therefore their Build is factored 
into the damage they deal. Thus, a small person"
What is a Crawling One composed of?,"Crawling ones are composed of a semi-liquid, semi-solid, and extremely elastic substance, commonly referred to as a ""mass"" or ""bulk"". This mass is made up of thousands of tiny, 
ropy, wormlike appendages. These appendages can be retracted into the bulk at will, 
providing a pseudopod with which to grasp prey or an additional limb with which to 
perform some manipulative task. The bulk of a crawling one is a translucent, 
semi-elastic mass, formed from the tips of the many appendages. It is this bulk that 
contains the crawling one's vital organs and with which it interacts with its environment. 
When the creature dies, its bulk ruptures and deflates with a disgusting 
popping sound, and the thousands of appendages shrivel up and 
break off, some still writhing and twisting in the ground.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Shadow Out of Time

Crawling ones look like elongated globular masses covered in 
thin, semi-elastic tentacles. These appendages can be retracted 
into the body at will. The creatures do not have any truly internal 
organs, with all essential functions performed by the central 
bulk."
What is the average STR of the Elder Thing?,"I'm sorry, I do not have information on Elder Things."
When do Clayton and Harris run into the forest in the 'Amidst the Ancient Trees' scenario?,"I don't have access to that information.  The ""Amidst the Ancient Trees"" scenario 
is from a Call of Cthulhu supplement and I don’t have access to the text.  If 
you are running that scenario you could check the scenario and find out. 
Alternatively you could make a guess. The scenario is listed as having a 
difficulty level of Hard, so it is likely that the clue is only obvious to the 
players if the investigators fail the roll."
