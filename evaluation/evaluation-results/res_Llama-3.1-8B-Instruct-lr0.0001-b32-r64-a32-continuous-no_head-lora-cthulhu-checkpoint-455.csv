Who wrote the Necronomicon chapter?,Keith Herber,1,"The Necronomicon is a fictional book in the Cthulhu Mythos created by 
H.P. Lovecraft. While it is generally attributed to the mad Arab Abdul 
Alhazred, it was actually written by many authors over the course 
of history. Each chapter of the Necronomicon is a different sectiion 
written by a different cultist or sorcerer. 

Abdul Alhazred is the commonly accepted author of the classic 
Necronomicon translation, the Greek Necronomicon. He lived in 
the 12th century and is believed to have originated the work. How-
ever, recent scholarship suggests that Alhazred did not write the 
work at all, but rather it is a translation of his writings by a Greek 
scholar, Theodoras Philetas, living in the 12th century. 

Other languages and partial translations are also known to exist. 
The  exact  number  of  Necronomicon  translations  and  partial 
translations is unknown, as Miskatonic University Library alone 
lists twelve different versions. Some are of poorer quality than 
others. The version translated by Dr. John Dee is particularly 
notorious, as",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is the role of the Keeper in the Call of Cthulhu?,"The Keeper runs the story, set the scene for the investigators, tells them what they can do and what the effect of their actions is",1,"In Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper is the game moderator or referee. The Keeper is the player of the ""enemy"" characters and non-player 
characters (NPCs) in the game and is responsible for creating and running the plot, describing the scene, moving non-player char-
acters, controlling monsters and enemies, and deciding if the investigators succeed or fail in their endeavors. 

The Keeper is the rules arbiter,  ensuring  that  the  game  runs  smoothly  and  that  the  rules  are  applied  fairly  and  consistently. 
In  addition,  the  Keeper  prepares  the  ""skeleton""  of  a  scenario,  including  the  important  non-player  characters,  the  key 
events and the monsters, and runs the game, controlling these elements and describing the outcome of the investigators’ actions. 
The Keeper is the game’s rules expert and arbiter of the game rules. The Keeper should read and fully study the rules of the 
game before running a scenario.

What dices are needed to play Call of Cthulhu?,"The following dices are needed: a percentile dice (called D100), a four-sided dice (called D4), a six-sided dice (called D6), an eight-sided dice (called D8), and a twenty-sided die (called D20)",1,"To  play  Call  of  Cthulhu,  you  will  need  a  set  of  dice,  in 
particular a 6-sided die (D6), a 4-sided die (D4), a 8-sided die 
(D8) and a 10-sided die (D10) and a 100-sided die (D100). The 
D100 is also known as percentiles dice as it is used to generate 
percentile results. Most Call of Cthulhu dice come in the form 
of a combination dice that includes a D4, D6, D8 and D10 all on 
one dice, with the numbers marked on the sides of the dice. You 
will also find a D100 (percentile dice) in the Investigator Sheet

What are the steps to create an investigator?,"There are five steps to create an investigator, namely: generate characteristics, determine occupation, decide skills and allocate Skill Points, create a backstory, equip the investigator",3,"To create an investigator for a game of Call of Cthulhu, follow 
these steps:

Step 1: Generate Characteristics
A  characteristic  is  one  of  eight  core  statistics  that  deter-
mine an investigator’s capacity in a given area. Roll 3D6 and 
multiply by 5 for each characteristic. Record the results in the 
space provided on the investigator sheet. 

The characteristics are:

G  Strength (STR): Indicates physical power.
G  Constitution (CON): Indicates health, vigor and vitality.
G  Size (SIZ): A larger investigator is likely to have a larger print, 
to  require  larger  clothing,  and  to  have  greater  physical 
strength. The upper and lower limits of Size are 1 and 99, 
respectively. Size does not factor into the difficulty level of 
physical attacks. A character’s living space also diminishes with 
a decrease in Size. A person with zero Size disappears. 

G  Intelligence (INT): A person with zero INT is in a persistent 
vegetative state, unable to communicate or care for themselves. 
INT rolls determine the starting number for the Sanity statistic

What modifiers should a player apply for a character that is 70 year old?,"The player should add 4 improvement checks for EDU and deduct 40 points among STR, CON or DEX, and reduce APP by 20",3,"For  a  70-year-old  investigator,  the  following  modifiers 
would be applied to the base values for a middle-aged person.

Sanity: 0
EDU: +1D10 (as a result of accumulated knowledge).
APP: 0 (less attractive, less hair, weight gain/loss, less flexi-
bility, slower movement, etc.
Damage Bonus: –1D4 (reduced physical strength and impact).
Hit  Points:  (Hit  Point  total  minus  current  hit  points)  plus

Move Rate: 1 (penalty die to STR and DEX rolls, and one penalty to 
MOV).

Age-Related Conditions
An  investigator  is  eligible  for  the  “Old  Age”  condition  in  the 
game when their age reaches 60 (see Aging, page 32). The play-

How can a player increase weapons skills?,A player can increase weapons skills by spending available Personal Interest or occupational skill points,3,"In  Call  of  Cthulhu,  a  character  may  increase  a  skill  by 
up to 10 percentage points with a successful roll against that skill 
during the investigator development phase. This is known as a 
""tick"". The character must have a skill value less than 50 before 
a tick can be gained. 

A skill can be ticked multiple times. Each tick adds 10 skill 
points (which are gained in the investigator development phase 
of play). When an increase of 10% is added to a skill, add 1 
to the skill base number. Thus, if a character has a 41% Fire-
arms (Rifle) skill, and this is increased to 51% by a tick, the 
base number is increased to 5. Any further increases of 10% 
are added to the base number: 55%, 65%, 75%, and so on.

When  a  skill  reaches  90%  or  more,  a  character  has  achieved 
a new level of mastery and has earned the right to add a new 
spiral to their diagram. The new spiral begins at 100 on the 
skill, from",You are a helpful AI assistant.
"Given a specific skill, what is the range of skill points for an investigator at the Amateur level?",between 20% and 49%,4,"In  Call  of  Cthulhu,  each  skill  has  a  base  chance  of 
success of 50%. The skill points for an investigator at Amateur 
level are enough to raise that base chance to 50+the skill points 
spending cap for that skill. 

The  skill  points  for  an  investigator  at  Amateur  level  is 
equal to the investigator’s % chance of success in that skill before 
any points have been spent. 

For  example:  if  the  base  chance  for  the  Fighting  (Brawl) 
skill is 40%, the investigator has 8 skill points to spend, allowing 
him or her to spend 1 point to raise their Fighting (Brawl) skill 
to 50%, their own Fighting (Brawl) skill, and so achieve a success 
on the roll. 

Note that points cannot be spent to increase a skill above 100%.

What is the hypnosis skill?,"It is the ability to induce another person in a trancelike state, which allows the person to relax and recall memories that were forgotten. The limits of the skill during the game are decided by the Keeper, for example if the player is able to use the skill on an unwilling target.",4,"In  the  game,  hypnosis  is  the  suggestion  of  ideas,  im-
agery, or movements to a person’s mind without the use of 
magic points. Hypnosis can be used on its own or in combi-
nation with other forms of persuasion, such as intimidation or 
bribery.  Hypnosis  is  most  effective  when  the  target  is 
suggestible,  and  suggests  a  willingness  to  be  influenced. 
Suggestible  individuals  may  be  easily  led  to  believe  they 
have spotted an acquaintance in a crowd of strangers, or that 
a particular item is important to them when it is not. 

The  Keeper  may  use  hypnosis  to  alter  a  non-player

Who decides the difficulty level of a skill roll?,The Keeper,5,"The difficulty level of a skill roll is set by the Keeper. 

There are six difficulty levels in all: Fumble, Failure, Regular, 

Success, Hard, and Extreme. 

Regular difficulty level: this is the default difficulty level. 

The player needs to roll equal to or below their full skill or 

characteristic to achieve the task.

For a skill roll, the player rolls equal to or below their full skill 

level (100%) to achieve the task.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: there are three levels of diffi-
culty in Call of Cthulhu: Regular, Hard, and Extreme. The 
Keeper may, in certain circumstances, vary the difficulty level. 
The difficulty level is not adjusted if the character takes a penalty 
die; nor is it adjusted for a bonus die (see Penalties and Bonuses 
and Bonus Dice, see page 91). 

Regular difficulty: a Regular difficulty level is a standard, 
everyday challenge. The player needs to roll equal to or below

What are the consequences of a successful Pushed Roll?,"The goal of the player are achieved as it would have been with the original role, without further consequences",5,"When  a  player  pushes  a  skill  roll  and  fails,  the  Keeper 
usually  has  the  option  of  inflicting  one  or  more  of  the 
following consequences. The Keeper can mix and match these to 
make the most dramatic effect.

T  The investigator loses hit points. This may require a medi-
cal  treatment  (First  Aid,  Medicine)  to  recover  (see 
Major Wound, page 123).

T  The  investigator  is  incapacitated  for  a  period  of  time 
(at  the  Keeper’s  discretion,  which  might  be  a  few  rounds 
or hours). During this time the player is incapacitated and 
can take no actions.

What happens when a player must use more than one skill?,"The Keeper decides if the player must roll a dice for each skill, or roll the dice only once. In the latter case, player makes only one dice roll and then applies the result to each of the skills",5,"When  a  situation  calls  for  the  use  of  more  than  one  skill, 
the Keeper should specify the skills involved and determine a dif-
ficulty level for each one. Players then make a skill roll for each

difficulty level of the other skill roll.

For  example,  in  a  fight,  a  character  might  try  to  grapple 
an  opponent  using  Brawling  skill  (a  fighting  maneuver)  at 
the  same  time  as  attempting  to  punch  the  opponent  using

acters, allowing players to create investigators to suit a wide range 
of playing styles. Some players may wish to create characters who 
are good in combat, while others may prefer to create solvers of 
puzzles and mysteries. Still others may wish to create a balanced

What is a Combat Round?,It is a unit of time in which each player can perform at least one action during combat.,6,"In a combat round, every participant in the combat gets a chance to act. The number of actions each participant gets in one round is usually determined by the number of movement actions (MOV) they have. 

A  combat  round  is  a  vital  concept  in  combat,  as  it  defines 
the  order  of  attack  and  the  number  of  attacks  that  can  be 
initiated in one round. Each character and monster gets one at-
tack action per round: those with multiple attacks can make all of 
them in a single round, while those with one attack must wait 
until the following round to make another. Some monsters and 
characters may have a bite, a kick and a fist, and are able to 
make all three attacks in one round. Others may only have one 
attack and so only get one opportunity to attack in a round. 
Those with multiple attacks may also have multiple attacks of the

In which situation is a character allowed to escape a close combat?,The character must have no physical restrains and have an escape route,6,"A character is allowed to escape a melee attack (close combat) on a

T  If the character dodges, they may do so on their normal 
Dodge skill of 25%. A successful dodge allows the character 
to avoid an attack and gain a fighting maneuver of their own 
on their next action.

T  If  the  character  fights  back,  they  may  do  so  using  a 
weapon or a basic fighting maneuver. The target of a fight-
ing maneuver may fight back using a basic fighting maneuver 
of their own. Both sides roll percentile dice and compare them 
to their Fighting skill. The higher skill wins, just like in a regular 
fighting attack. If the target is holding a weapon, this may be

A Major Wound is only healed when the character’s current hit points fall below a multiple of 10 (i.e. 0, –10, 
–20, etc.) and, in that moment, the Major Wound box is unticked by the Keeper. The character does not make a CON 
roll to recover from a Major Wound if their current hit points fall to 0 or below, as they are unconscious and thus unable 
to act. A character cannot die as a result of a Major Wound if their current hit points are already at 0; the Major Wound

Those that fail to achieve a level of success are not allowed to move until their next action. 

Those that roll a Extreme level of success move twice. 

Order of movement is determined by the highest to lowest speed.

What methods can the Keeper use to create obstacles and hazards during a chase?,"The Keeper can decide using his own imagination, or do that randomly using a 1D100 roll.",7,"The Keeper should create hazards and barriers on the fly as the chase unfolds. 

1.  Barriers:  These  block  progress  for  1D6  movement  ac-
tions. Examples include: a locked door; a high fence; a river.

Examples include: climbing over a 4-foot fence; running to 
the top of a flight of stairs; wading through a stream.

G  A clear, obstacle-free distance of 10 meters (33 yards) 
or less will always allow for a DEX order in the DEX

A  passenger  vehicle  has  a  build  of  1.  Most  vehicles  are  not 
equipped with armor plating and so do not have any additional 
armor points. A car might have a few hidden pitfalls or hazards, 
such as a loose rock or oil slick, that could cause an accident, but 
these are not typically anticipated and so do not require a Luck 
roll.

What state of insanity exist in the game?,"There are three states of insanity: temporary, indefinite and permanent.",8,"In the Call of Cthulhu game, there are four states of insanity. 

Firstly, there is temporary insanity, also known as ""bout of 
madness"". This lasts 1D10 hours. 

Secondly, there is a 24-hour temporary insanity. This is 
triggered when an investigator loses 5 or more Sanity points as 
a result of a single Sanity roll. 

Thirdly, there is indefinite insanity, also known as ""permanent 
madness"". This occurs when an investigator loses as much as or 
more than a characteristically maximum Sanity score in one game 
day, or when an investigator’s Sanity points fall to zero or below. 
Indefinite insanity lasts until the investigator is cured or recovers 
(see Recovery from Indefinite Insanity, page 162).

Fourthly, there is permanent insanity, which results when an 
investigator loses all Sanity points (in which case the game for that 
investigator is effectively over).

It is worth noting that the effects of temporary and indefinite 
insanity are the same: the player takes no control of the investi-
gator for the duration of the bout of madness. The difference is 
that temporary insanity lasts for 1D10 hours, whereas",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How many Sanity points must an investigator loose to become temporary insane?,Five or more,8,"An investigator must lose 5 or more Sanity points without any 
other Sanity rolls being made (consecutively, not in a single 
roll) to become temporarily insane.  An investigator that has 
lost 5 or more Sanity points as a result of a single Sanity roll 
is  permanently  insane.  Note  that  the  loss  of  1D10  Sanity 
points or more in one day also leads to permanent insanity.

While  the  investigator  is  temporarily  insane  (which  is 
each hour that the investigator is insane), the player must make 
an Intelligence roll at the end of each hour of game time. If the 
player fails the roll, the investigator remains insane for another 
hour.  If  the  player  succeeds  in  the  Intelligence  roll,  the 
investigator is no longer insane and the player can make a San-
ity roll to see if their investigator loses additional Sanity points as 
a result of their bout of madness.

ity  roll  to  see  if  their  investigator  has  gone  temporarily  or

How is it decided how many hours temporary insanity lasts?,By rolling a 1D10. The results of the roll provides the number of hours of insanity,8,"In Call of Cthulhu,  the  duration  of  temporary  insanity  is 
determined  by  rolling  on  Table  VIII:  Duration  of  Insanity, 
with  the  Keeper  choosing  either  ""hours""  or  ""days""  as  the 
unit of time, depending on the circumstances of the bout of 
madness. 

If  hours  are  chosen,  the  Keeper  should  have  an  idea 
of  how  time  passes  during  the  bout  of  madness.  If  days 
are chosen, the Keeper should have a good idea of how long 
the bout of madness will last. 

If  the  Keeper  knows  that  the  bout  of  madness  will  be 
limited to a short period, such as until the character is out of 
sight of the thing they are trying to flee from, then the bout of 
madness should be set to only a few hours or rounds. If the

for  a  day  or  more,  then  the  bout",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is the best way to recover from Indefinite Insanity?,The best way to recover is through private care or home care,8,"In Call of Cthulhu,  indefinite  insanity  is  a  potentially  dire  con-
dition for an investigator, and getting an investigator back on his or 
her feet can take time. 

Recovery from indefinite insanity requires a Sanity roll. An in-
vestigator  recovers  from  indefinite  insanity  when  he  or  she  is 
found to have fully returned to their senses and their behavior is 
no longer disordered. This takes 1D10 days. During this time 
the player must make a Sanity roll at the end of each week of in-
definite insanity. If the Sanity roll is failed, the investigator falls 
back into a state of madness and the process starts over. If the 
Sanity  roll  is  successful,  the  investigator  has  recovered  and 
returns to the game as normal.

Alternatively,  at  the  Keeper’s  discretion,  recovery  can  be 
accelerated  if  the  investigator  is  successfully  treated  by  a  doc-
tor.  This  may  be  especially  true  in  a  hospital  or  sanitarium.  The

How can a character learn a spell?,"There are three main ways to learn a spell: from a Mythos book, from another player, or from a Mythos entity",9,"In  the  game,  learning  a  spell  is  a  variable  and  poten-
tially hazardous process. Spells are not something to be picked 
up quickly, and usually require dedication and attention from 
the caster. A player seeks to know the cost and effect of a spell, 
including the magic points, Sanity points, and Sanity loss, as 
well as any other relevant information.

There are three methods of learning a spell.

Learning a Spell from a Book
A  book  of  spells  is  a  Mythos  tome.  Each  tome  is  dif-
ferent, with a unique set of spells and information. The user 
of a tome must spend time reading it, usually 2D6 weeks, 
and  the  book  must  be  open  and  the  reader  fully  focused 
upon it. While the investigator is learning a spell from a book,

thereafter without additional time being required.

What type of roll must a player do to cast a spell?,A Hard POW roll,9,"In most cases, to cast a spell, a player must make an opposed 
POW (Power) roll. This is opposed by the POW of the target of 
the spell (if any) or the local ""ambient"" POW (for spells cast at a 
remote location or in a supposedly ""haunted"" area). 

The  player  should  state  what  the  investigator  is  trying 
to achieve with the spell. The Keeper then tells if it is possible 
and, if so, asks for a POW roll. If the roll is a success, the spell 
works as described in the rules. A failed roll means that noth-
ing happens. A fumble has some special consequences (usually 
bad ones). 

The Keeper should never tell a player that he or she has won 
a roll until the story has been developed a little. Avoid saying, 
“Yes, you were able to push the door open”, instead say “The 
door creaked and splintered as it swung open”. The latter in-
cludes a consequence (the door is damaged) that is in addition 
to the player winning the roll.

T  Nothing happens. This is the default for a failed casting 
roll. No Sanity points are lost and no magic points are spent.
T  The spell has a partial effect. The Keeper may choose to 
have part (but not all) of the spell’s effect take place. For 
example, in the case of a Create Zombie spell, the corpse 
comes to life but does not act like a normal zombie. Per-
haps it is friendly and docile? Picking a random selection 
of characteristics might create an unusual zombie.

What information is advised that the Keeper gives to the players before they create their investigators?,"The date and location of the player scenario, a basic description of the beginning of the scenario, professions suitable for the scenario, and suggestions on how the investigator know each other",10,"Before the players create their investigators, the Keeper should provide some background information to set the tone for the game. 

First, the Keeper should tell the players a little about the time and place in which the game is set. This could be a specific historical period, or a general era such as the 1920s or the future. 

Next, the Keeper should say a little about the situation or events that the investigators find themselves in at the start of the game. This could be a general situation, such as, “You are all members of a posse, hunting down a cultist,” or a more specific situation, such as, “You wake up in a hospital with no memory of who you are or how you got there.”

The Keeper should also provide some background information for each investigator, in the form of a backstory. This need only be a few sentences for each investigator, but it helps to drive the sense of identity for the player. 

The  Keeper  should  also  provide  some  information  about  the

What are NPCs?,NPCs are Non-player characters that are controlled by the Keeper,10,"NPC  stands  for  Non-Player  Character.  In  roleplaying  games,

person running the game) controls non-player characters and the 
atmosphere,  keeping  the  game  moving  and  running  the  ene-
mies the players meet. Non-player characters can be minor, such as 
barkeepers  who  simply  react  to  the  players,  or  they  can  be 
major, such as the main villain of the scenario. 

You may also create a backstory for a non-player character 
that goes beyond the simple role of antagonist or informant. A 
fully detailed non-player character can be used as the focus of 
a whole scenario, where the investigators must deal with the 
problems and situation that the non-player character finds him-
or herself in. This can be particularly effective when the player 
characters are all relative to the non-player character—perhaps

What is an Idea Roll?,"It is a roll that allows players to get a clue, and that decides how they get this clue",10,"In roleplaying games, an Idea roll is a dice roll used to determine the 
source of information for the players when their investigators lack a 
clear clue or lead, allowing them to improvise and suggest some 
information  their  investigators  might  know,  and  allowing  the 
Keeper to decide on the validity of their suggestions. 

The players roll dice to see if their investigators discover a clue 
on their own. The Keeper sets a difficulty level and the player rolls 
either  a  characteristically  skill  roll  (opposed  by  an  opposing 
skill  or  characteristic)  or  a  Luck  roll.  If  the  roll  is  success-
ful,  the  player  gets  to  suggest  a  clue,  which  is  then  adapted 
(or not) by the Keeper to fit the game and story. 

If the roll is failed, no clue is gained and play moves on.
