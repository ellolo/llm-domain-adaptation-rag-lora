Who wrote the Necronomicon chapter?,Keith Herber,1,"The Necronomicon is a fictional book in the Cthulhu Mythos created by the American author H.P. Lovecraft. 

The Necronomicon is attributed to the Arab Abdul Al-hazred, who wrote it in the 12th century. However, the version that Lovecraft used as his source was apparently a Greek translation, although the original Arabic version has also been mentioned. 

The Greek version was apparently written by Theodoras Philetas in the 15th century. It was from this version that Lovecraft got most of his information about the Necronomicon. 

Other versions and partial copies of the Necronomicon exist. A Latin version was apparently made in the 15th century, as was a German version. A complete Arabic version is held by the British Museum. 

In 1915, a copy of the Greek version of the Necronomicon was discovered by Dr. John Dee, a consultant to Queen Elizabeth the First of England. The book had apparently come from the library of the infamous witch-trial prosecutor, Sir William  Lancaster.  The  Greek  Necronomicon  was  printed  in  Egypt  in  the  12th  century,  although  earlier",You are a helpful AI assistant.

What dices are needed to play Call of Cthulhu?,"The following dices are needed: a percentile dice (called D100), a four-sided dice (called D4), a six-sided dice (called D6), an eight-sided dice (called D8), and a twenty-sided die (called D20)",1,"To play Call of Cthulhu, you will need the following dice:

1.  Four  six-sided  dice  (D6),  one  of  which  is  a  1D6 
percentile die (noted as D6 or 1D6 on some dice). The stan-
dard  dice  found  in  most  game  stores  contain  the  numbers 
1 through 10 on one die and the numbers 11 through 20 on the 
other. This pair of dice are used for percentage rolls by using the 
number rolled on the 10-sided die and adding it to the number 
rolled on the 20-sided die (read as ""4 and 18"" being rolled as

How many dices are needed at a minimum to play the game?,5,1,"The minimum number of players for many roleplaying games is three; one person to play the role of Keeper (also known as a Game Moderator or 
Keeper of Arcane Lore) and two players to roleplay investigators. More players can join in as investigators. Some versions of games 
have different rules for solo play, where one player plays the investigator and also takes on the role of Keeper.

It is not possible to have a game with only one player, as the interactive nature of the game is based on discussion and de-
cision-making between players. Roleplaying is about people, people in an atmosphere of fear, excitement, surprise, confusion, 
laughter, and adventure. 

The more players you have, the more characters you have to choose from and the more exciting the game can become. How-
ever, as the number of players increases, so does the amount of organization and preparation required. 

Three to five players are ideal. With this many players, everyone gets a chance to play a variety of investigators and non-player 
characters.  It  is  not  essential  to  have  a  balance  of  male  and 
female investigators. Whatever you and your group enjoy is what 
is most important.

What are the steps to create an investigator?,"There are five steps to create an investigator, namely: generate characteristics, determine occupation, decide skills and allocate Skill Points, create a backstory, equip the investigator",3,"Creating an investigator is a fun and exciting part of playing the Call of Cthulhu game. Here are the steps to create an investigator:

Step 1: Decide on an Era
The  era  in  which  your  investigator  is  born  and  operates 
can  be  important  in  defining  your  investigator’s  backstory 
and  the  equipment  and  skills  that  are  available.  The  eras 
are:
Gilded Age (pre-1920s): Late 19th century to the early 20th 
century. For the most part, this period aligns with the rules 
for the Modern Day. The end of this period is marked by the 
prohibition era in the United States.

Modern Day: 1920s to present. The rules for this period 
are the same as for the Modern Day era, simply starting with 
a more advanced level of skill and artifact availability.

Step 2: Generate Characteristics
A  characteristic  is  a  numerical  value  that  helps  to  define 
your investigator and determine his or her relative capability. 
There are eight characteristics:

What modifiers should a player apply for a character that is 70 year old?,"The player should add 4 improvement checks for EDU and deduct 40 points among STR, CON or DEX, and reduce APP by 20",3,"In many roleplaying games, 70 is considered an old person. 
The  exact  modifiers  will  depend  on  the  specific  rules  of 
the game being played, but here are some common ones:

  •  CON  and  SIZ  rolls  should  be  multiplied  by  2  for 
a  70-year-old  person,  reflecting  the  loss  of  muscle  and 
physical strength that occurs with old age.

  •  APP  and  DEX  rolls  should  be  multiplied  by  1.5,  as 
these characteristics are less affected by age. EDU might also 
be raised by 1D6 to reflect the person’s accumulated knowl-
edge and wisdom.

  •  Reduce  MOV  by  1  for  every  10  points  of  age  over 
40. Thus a 50-year-old would have MOV 4, a 51-year-old 
would have MOV 3, and so on.

How can a player increase weapons skills?,A player can increase weapons skills by spending available Personal Interest or occupational skill points,3,"In most roleplaying games, weapon skills can be improved through use and practice. Here are some general methods that may be 
applicable to your game:

i  Practice:  Using  the  weapon  successfully  in  a  combat  yields  experience  points  and  a  rise  in  skill.  Each  use 
of the skill in play is a chance to gain experience points and so rise in skill. Each skill gain might also allow the use of 
more advanced techniques with the weapon.

i  Training:  Formal  tuition  from  a  tutor  is  the  best  way  to  learn  a  skill.  The  tutor  may  be  a  fellow  investigator, 
a professor, or even a criminal enabler. The Keeper may make a skill roll to determine the success of the teaching. A Luck 
roll may also be required. The student can then gain double the normal amount of skill points for a successful roll. The tutor 
must be at least as skilled in the subject as the student. The teacher and student must work without interruption. The student 
can gain a maximum of 20 skill points in one learning roll. This cannot be gained in a single game session,",You are a helpful AI assistant.
"Given a specific skill, what is the range of skill points for an investigator at the Amateur level?",between 20% and 49%,4,"In the main, the skill points for an Amateur in a skill are between 5 and 20. 

An  investigator  can  spend  skill  points  to  raise  any  skill  to 
equal  their  own  personal  skill  points.  Thus  an  investigator 
with  a  Credit  Rating  of  75  can  spend  skill  points  to  raise 
their  Fighting  (Brawl)  skill  to  75%.  An  investigator  with  a 
Credit Rating of 89 can spend skill points to raise their Fighting 
(Brawl) skill to 89%. 

In  this  way  an  investigator  can  become  an  expert  in  a 
fighting  style  without  taking  a  Fighting  specialism  skill.  A 
character can spend skill points to purchase any skill specialization. 
Fighting skill specializations represent a character’s expertise in 
using weapons in close combat. The generic Fighting skill can be 
used when the type of weapon is not specified or when fighting 
with the hands, feet, or any other body part.

gauge the success or failure of an attempt to hypnotize or sug-
gest to an individual, whether it be to influence a non-player 
character in the game or to keep an investigator under control. 
It is up to the player whether an investigator is aware of being 
hypnotized or influenced by suggestion; however, if the investi-
gator is aware, a successful Psychology roll allows him or her to 
resist.

Who decides the difficulty level of a skill roll?,The Keeper,5,"The Keeper sets the difficulty level of a skill roll. 

The player declares their intention and then the Keeper decides 
whether the difficulty level should be Regular, Hard, or Extreme. 
The Keeper should not allow a player to dictate the difficulty 
level of a skill roll. 

The Keeper should consider the difficulty level in relation to 
the current situation within the game. The odds should be fair 
for the investigator, but the Keeper should not be bound by the 
mathematical probability of winning or losing. 

If the player has stated an intention to attempt something, 
the Keeper should consider what skill or characteristic would 
be used to test the situation and be ready to set a difficulty 
level. Setting difficulty levels is an important part of being a 
Keeper and every effort should be made to set one for each

only motivated to push a skill roll if the potential gain is worth 
the risk.

determining the consequence of a pushed roll:

G  An  investigator  is  no  closer  to  their  goal  than  they

how they wish to allocate their funds. 

Movement Rate:  The  standard  rules  use  a  movement  ac-
tion each round to allow the players to move their investigators

What is a Combat Round?,It is a unit of time in which each player can perform at least one action during combat.,6,"In a tabletop roleplaying game, a combat round is a specific period 
of  game  time  during  a  fight  in  which  every  participant  has 
an opportunity to act. 

A combat round is not second to second, it is more like a frac-

All participants make a skill roll: CON (for human characters) or 
the appropriate characteristic (for monsters and non-player charac-
ters); the one with the highest roll goes first, and so on. If there 
is a tie, the side with the higher DEX goes first. If still a tie, the 
characters are positioned in order of their MOV rating. Characters 
that are not in a state of movement action are not included in the

Those with a difference of 2 MOV rates will not act in the same round, nor will those with a difference of 3 MOV rates, and so on. Characters with a higher MOV rate get an additional movement action with each round that those with a lower MOV rate have already used up. 

Note: Some monsters and non-player characters may have a MOV rate that is not on the chart. In such cases, the Keeper must decide whether to round down or up; a non-player character with a MOV rate of 8 would be able to move 8 or 9 locations in one round, but would normally be limited to 8 locations, the same as a human.

How are vehicle damages computed after a collision?,By rolling a 1D6 to compute build damage. A delay of the vehicle can also be computed costing a 1D3 movement action,7,"In  most  cases,  damage  to  a  vehicle  is  figured  using  the 
Fighting  skill.  The  Keeper  should  decide  whether  a  particular 
collision  constitutes  a  fighting  maneuver  or  a  hazard,  and 
thus  whether  the  vehicle  is  treated  as  a  weapon  or  as  a 
characteristic. 

When a vehicle is used as a weapon, it is treated like any other 
weapon.  The  Keeper  decides  on  the  damage  done  by  a  col-
lision.  If  the  vehicle  is  being  used  to  inflict  harm,  it  may 
also be used to fight back against those trying to attack it. A car 
or truck has a Build of 5, the same as a large human. If attacking 
with a vehicle, a character would use their Fighting skill. A being 
with a Build of 0 could be knocked to the floor by a strong wind, 
but might only be pushed or disarmed by a fellow human.

What state of insanity exist in the game?,"There are three states of insanity: temporary, indefinite and permanent.",8,"In the game of Call of Cthulhu, an investigator can go insane, 
and when he or she does so, they experience a bout of madness. 
There are four states of active insanity in the game:

1.  Temporary  Insanity:  While  the  investigator  is  in  a 
state of temporary insanity, they will act irrationally. As this is 
a temporary state, the investigator will recover after a few days 
of rest and treatment.

2.  Permanent  Insanity:  While  the  investigator  is  in  a 
state of permanent insanity, they will continue to act irration-
ally. As this is a permanent state, the investigator will require 
professional treatment to recover. The player takes control of 
the investigator when they are sane.

3.  Permanent  Insanity  with  Underlying  Sanity:  When 
an  investigator  loses  more  Sanity  points  than  their  current 
Sanity score in one go (see page 156), they suffer a major in-
sanity  incident  resulting  in  permanent  insanity.  In  this  case

How is it decided how many hours temporary insanity lasts?,By rolling a 1D10. The results of the roll provides the number of hours of insanity,8,"In Call of Cthulhu, the duration of temporary insanity is deter-
mined by rolling on Table 8: Bouts of Madness—Summary, 
or  by  rolling  1D10  hours  and  rounding  up,  see  Temporary 
Insanity (page 124). 

In some instances, the Keeper may choose to roll 1D10 and 
multiply the result by 10 to get a number of hours (see Rethinking 
a Situation, page 162).

It is advised that the Keeper does not use time in this way as 
a  punishment.  Instead  the  Keeper  should  try  to  incorporate 
the  negative  consequence  of  a  failed  Pushed  roll  within  the 
story and make it relevant to the non-player character. For exam-
ple,  if  the  goal  were  to  persuade  a  police  officer,  a  failed 
Pushed roll could result in the officer becoming belligerent and 
arresting the investigator for obstructing a police officer in the 
performance of his duty—something that will only serve to add 
to the investigator’s troubles later on.

What is the best way to recover from Indefinite Insanity?,The best way to recover is through private care or home care,8,"Recovery from indefinite insanity can take a while. 

Indefinite insanity lasts until the investigator is cured or recovers. 
The duration of indefinite insanity is left up to the Keeper. It can 
be a few days, a month, or even years. 

The only way to end indefinite insanity is with successful Intellect 
( INT ) rolls. The player makes a roll and if they fail, they make 
another roll and so on. The Keeper may set a maximum number 
of rolls that may be attempted. A variation is to require that the 
player roll equal to or below half their INT. 

Alternatively,  the  Keeper  could  allow  a  combined  dice 

roll, with the player rolling a percentile dice and the Keeper rolling 
a 1D100 alongside them. If the player wins the roll, the investigator 
recovers from their insanity. If the Keeper wins, the bout of madness 
continues.

A  bout  of  madness  ends  when  the  investigator  either  recovers

How can a character learn a spell?,"There are three main ways to learn a spell: from a Mythos book, from another player, or from a Mythos entity",9,"In the world of roleplaying, learning a spell can be a 
various  and  mysterious  process.  Here  are  a  few  ideas 
to get you started. 

Finding a Copy of the Book
An  occult  tome  is  the  primary  source  for  learning  a 
spell. Each tome is different, and the information in here is 
meant to be a starting point for the Keeper to draw from. A 
tome might list a spell’s name, a general description of what 
the spell does, an estimate of the casting time, the number 
of magic points needed, and any special ingredients or por-
tions needed. A tome might also note any special conditions 
that must be met for the spell to succeed.

A spell can be found in only one place in a tome, though 
the same information can be pieced together from several 
different sources. The Keeper can dictate which spells can be 
found in which tomes, though consistency is not required. 
The  Keeper  should  not  feel  compelled  to  include  any 
specific spells in any of the books, although the Keeper’s 
library should have at least one copy of each Mythos tome

What type of roll must a player do to cast a spell?,A Hard POW roll,9,"In roleplaying games, to cast a spell the player must make a 
Sanity roll (if the spell costs Sanity points) and also a roll for 
the skill used by the spell. If the spell costs magic points it may 
not be cast if the caster is out of magic points. Some spells have 
other prerequisites, such as the need for a piece of enchanted 
wax, a vial of space-mead, and so on. 

Whether a character is able to cast a particular spell is also 
determined by his or her Cthulhu Mythos skill (see page 63). 
No one has ever listed the complete range of spells that the 
Cthulhu  Mythos  encompasses.  Spells  are  presented  in 
this  book  in  a  number  of  categories,  including  Call  and 
Contact Spells, Creation Spells, Enchantment Spells, Gate 
Spells,  Power  Spells,  and  Summoning  Spells.  Spells  may 
also be grouped according to theme in some Mythos scenarios, 
such as spells for contacting the dead or for causing harm to 
enemies.

What happens when a spell casting roll fails?,"The caster must pay Magic points, Sanity Points and/or POW, multiplied by 1D6",9,"When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  pushed  and  failed,  the  caster 
must immediately pay the full Magic point cost of the spell. No 
such payment is required if the roll is a regular success.

When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  pushed  and  the  roll  is  still 
failed, the caster should consider the consequences for the failed 
casting roll (see The Consequences of Failing a Pushed Spell 
Casting Roll, page 180). No Magic points are spent or San-
ity lost if the pushed roll is failed.

When  a  spell  is  recast  as  a  pushed  casting  (while  the 
original casting is still in effect) the Keeper must apply the con-
sequences of the pushed casting roll to the current spell effect. In 
other words, the pushed casting roll is not for the benefit of the 
caster but for the benefit of the players. It gives the players an 
opportunity to alter or negate the current spell effect.

The  only  alternative  to  this  is  to  allow  the  players  to 
make a skill roll to resist the spell, which may not always be 
appropriate",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What information is advised that the Keeper gives to the players before they create their investigators?,"The date and location of the player scenario, a basic description of the beginning of the scenario, professions suitable for the scenario, and suggestions on how the investigator know each other",10,"When starting a game of Call of Cthulhu, it is advised that the Keeper provides the players with some background information on the period in which the game is set. This is usually done to encourage the players to 
keep their period setting knowledge in mind when generating their investigators. 

The players are encouraged to ask questions about the setting to the Keeper. The Keeper should try to give out as little information as possible, feeding the players just enough information to keep them interested and 
motivated. The players will pick up on what you are giving them verbally, so be sure to keep control of non-player characters and the world around the players’ investigators. 

When the players have decided on their investigators, the Keeper should take a close look to ensure that no one investigator is going to dominate the game. If one player has created a highly powerful investigator, it may be 
necessary for the Keeper to even the odds by adding a complication or two to that investigator’s backstory. 

The players now have their starting point from which to begin the game. Their goal, as mentioned, is to find out what has happened to their missing friend. The players know that the university is closed until

What are NPCs?,NPCs are Non-player characters that are controlled by the Keeper,10,"NPC  stands  for  Non-Player  Character.  In  roleplaying 
games,  such  as  Dungeons  &  Dragons,  the  players  control 
their  investigator  characters,  while  the  Keeper  (usually  the 
person running the game) controls everyone else, known as non-
player characters. Nonplayer characters can be the investigators’ 
allies or their enemies, and often include simple, unintelligent 
creatures for the players to fight against. 

In published scenarios, nonplayer characters may have their 
characteristics, skills, and so on already worked out, and some 
may even have their own dice and paper for record-keeping. 
Other nonplayer characters may be played “on the fly” and do 
not require any additional work from the Keeper. 

When  a  group  of  investigators  is  involved,  a  Keeper 
will usually have five or six people to keep track of, and this is 
not so bad; however, when the investigators are joined by a 
bunch of other nonplayer characters, the number of people the 
Keeper has to keep track of can quickly escalate. To help with

What is an Idea Roll?,"It is a roll that allows players to get a clue, and that decides how they get this clue",10,"In roleplaying games, an Idea Roll is a dice roll used to determine whether

An  Idea  Roll  is  usually  called  for  when  a  player  proposes  an 
unforeseen action or event. The roll determines whether events in the 
game unfold as the player wishes or if the Keeper uses the result to block 
the player’s progress, perhaps with some negative consequence.

An Idea Roll is different to a Perception (Spot Hidden, Listen, Psy-
chology)  roll.  A  Perception  roll  is  used  to  allow  the  player  to 
discover hidden information. An Idea roll is used to allow the player 
to use previously undiscovered hidden information.

An Idea Roll is different to a Pushed roll. A Pushed roll is used when 
a player asks for a second attempt at a skill roll, usually with the aim

Sanity points (if appropriate), and POW that must be factored 
into the character’s build. Learning a spell may take weeks, a 
month or more. The Keeper decides on the time required. The 
study of a tome is an important factor and can add greatly to 
the learning time. The Keeper should never feel constrained to 
use the rules for learning a spell in the manner it is presented
