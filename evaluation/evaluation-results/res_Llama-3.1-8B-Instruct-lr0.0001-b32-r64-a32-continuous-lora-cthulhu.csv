Who wrote the Necronomicon chapter?,"The Necronomicon was written by many authors, as it is a 
compendium of magical and horrific lore. The greater portion 
of the work was written by the mad Arab, Abdul Al-hazred, in 
the year 730. However, other authors are known to have con-
tributed to the Necronomicon, although the extent of their 
involvement is unknown. 

The Necronomicon is believed to be a translation of an 
even older and forgotten work, the Al Azif. The Al Azif was 
written by the inhabitants of Hyperborea and concerns themselves 
with the gods,  creatures,  and  magic  of  the  Cthulhu  Mythos. 
The Al Azif was never translated into any other language and it 
is believed that only a few copies of the original Arabic exist. 

The year 950 marks the beginning of the medieval renaiss-
ance in Europe, and it is in this period that the first manuscrip-
ts of the Al Azif begin to appear in the south of France. These 
earliest  versions  are  incomplete,  inaccurate,  and  bereft  of 
the illustrations. As the centuries progress,",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is the role of the Keeper in the Call of Cthulhu?,"In Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper is the game moderator, taking the role of 
referee, presenter, and co-player all in one. The Keeper is the game 
control center, ensuring that the rules are applied fairly and that 
the game flows well. The Keeper should be familiar with the rules 
and be able to convey them to the players. Most importantly, the 
Keeper loves the game and is passionate about presenting an enjoy-
able experience for all players.

of the dice and running the game for your friends or be content 
to play a character and let someone else run the game. Either 
way, you’ll have lots of fun.

This  chapter  provides  a  step-by-step  guide  to  creating  a 
Lovecraftian  adventure,  enough  to  give  you  confidence  to

What dices are needed to play Call of Cthulhu?,"To play Call of Cthulhu, you’ll need the following dice:

1.  Four  six-sided  dice  (D6)  (usually  abbreviated  as  ""D6""  and 
sometimes called ""pips""). Most of the rolling in Call of Cthulhu 
is  done  with  six-sided  dice.  You  can  find  these  in  most  toy 
stores  that  sell  board  games.  Two  of  these  make  a  ""pair""  or 
""pair of tens"". If you have four of these, you have a ""pair of pairs"" 
or ""quarter"". 

1D6 reads ""one D-six"".

2.  One  eight-sided  die  (D8);  you  can  find  these  in  some 
hobby  stores  and  online.  Read  an  eight-sided  die  as  ""one 
D-eight"".

3.  One  ten-sided  die  (D10);  you  can  find  these  in  some 
hobby stores and online. Read a ten-sided die as “one D-ten”.

4.  One  percentile",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How many dices are needed at a minimum to play the game?,"I'm assuming you are referring to a dice game, likely a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG). The most well-known RPG is the ""Call of Cthulhu"" game. 

A pair of percentile dice (d100) and four six-sided dice (d6) make up the standard set of dice for Call of Cthulhu. 

You can buy a set of dice that includes the three required dice (a d4, d6, and d100) plus some extra dice, or you can buy individual dice and cut up two of them to make the required dice. 

If you don’t have access to the required dice, you can substitute with a combination of a 4-sided die (d4) and a 6-sided die (d6). A d4 can be read as a d2 (half of a d4 is a 1 or 2) and a d6 can be read as a d3 (half of a d6 is a 1, 2 or 3). Together they can simulate a d10 (1 to 10) and a d100 (1 to 100).

What is the legacy of Lovecraft?,"The legacy of H.P. Lovecraft is immense and far-reaching, 
stretching far beyond the realm of literature and into film, 
television, comics, role-playing games, and popular culture 
in general. Lovecraft’s stories have become the basis for the 
modern horror genre, and his creations, particularly Cthulhu 
and the Necronomicon, have become well-known horror icons. 
His stories have influenced some of the most famous horror 
writers of our time, including Stephen King, who has often 
acknowledged Lovecraft’s influence on his work.

What are the steps to create an investigator?,"To create an investigator in the 1920s, follow these steps:

Step 1: Generate Characteristics
Find a dice and roll 3D6 (3 six-sided dice) to generate five 
characteristic values, then multiply each by 5. These are the 
investigator's characteristics (see page 32).

Step 2: Determine Occupation
Choose an occupation (pages 68-69) that fits your idea for 
the investigator. Each occupation has its own list of skills, 
and some occupations require specific skill combinations or 
specific skill values. Some occupations are only suitable to 
certain types of stories and campaigns.

Step 3: Decide Characteristics
All  investigators  have  the  following  characteristics:  APP 
(appearance),  EDU  (education),  IDE  (ideology/beliefs), 
INT (intelligence), POW (power), and DEX (dexterity). 

Other  characteristics,  such  as  Sanity,  are  not  rolled  up 
front;  they  fluctuate  during  play.  Characteristics  are  rolled 
differently  depending  on  the  version  of  the  game  you  are

What modifiers should a player apply for a character that is 70 year old?,"According to  the  rulebook,  one  penalty  die  is  applied  to 
physical  characteristics  (see  Damage  Bonus  and  Build, 
page 33) if they are in the 60-69 age bracket, and two penalty 
dice are applied in the 70-79 age bracket. Three penalty dice 
are applied in the 80-89 age bracket and four penalty dice in 
the 90+ age bracket. 

Note  that  these  are  penalties,  applied  directly  to  the 
character’s  dice  rolls,  and  so  should  be  recorded  as  penalty 
dice on the investigator sheet. 

Luck
The Luck score is used to determine how many Luck points a 
character  has,  and  thus  how  many  Luck  points  can  be  spent 
during the game (see Luck, above). 

Luck points are used to alter dice rolls and, as such, they can 
affect the outcome of investigator development.

good health, while a low Luck score may mean that the inves-
tigator is prone to illness and blighted by bad",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How can a player increase weapons skills?,"In the game, weapon skills can be increased through use and practice. When an investigator uses a weapon in a successful attack, the user gains a degree of experience with the weapon. 

There is a good old-fashioned skill called ""Fighting"" that em-
braces  a  wide  variety  of  unarmed  and  simple  weapons.  If  a 
character  is  using  a  more  complex  weapon  (such  as  a  rifle) 
with which they are unfamiliar, they must use the ""Firearms"" 
skill.  If  they  are  using  a  weapon  with  which  they  are  less 
familiar, they may use the ""Fighting"" skill. For example, if an 
investigator were to use an axe (a weapon with which they are 
less familiar) in a fight, they would have to make a Fresh-
ness  roll  (roll  equal  to  or  less  than  their  Fighting  skill)  to 
see if they are able to use it effectively. If the roll is failed, the 
character may still fight back, but takes a penalty die.

What is the hypnosis skill?,"The Hypnosis skill is a mental manipulation technique that can be used to persuade or compel an individual to act in a certain way, similar to the Charm or Intimidate skills; however, it is more subtle and subtle manipulation is required. 

Hypnosis can be used on its own or in combination with other skills. If used in combination with another skill, the hypnosis roll must be made first and if successful, the other skill is used on the following round. Hypnosis can be used on both living and dead targets.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Hypnosis is opposed with Psychology or POW for a normal 

human target.

i  If the target is under significant stress or has a strong emotional 

connection to the topic then the difficulty level is Hard. 

i  If  the  target  is  highly  suggestible,  fatigued,  or  an  easy 

mark, the difficulty level is Hard. 

Pushing examples:  Guilt-tripping the target into submission;

the target;  playing  on  the  target’s  religious  or  political 
beliefs to win them over.

Who decides the difficulty level of a skill roll?,"In Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper decides the difficulty level of a skill roll. 

There are three levels of difficulty in Call of Cthulhu: Regular, Hard, and Extreme. 

Regular difficulty level: an average example of what would challenge a competent person. The player needs to roll equal to or below their full skill or characteristic in order to succeed. 

Hard difficulty level: this task would challenge a professional. The player needs to roll equal to or below a half of their skill or characteristic in order to succeed. 

Extreme  difficulty  level:  this  task  would  challenge  an  expert;  it  is  on  the 
border of what is humanly possible. The player needs to roll equal to or 
below a fifth of their skill or characteristic in order to succeed.

If the difficulty level of a task is set to Hard or Extreme and the roll is failed, 
the Keeper may choose to inflict damage or some other form of harm as a 
consequence of failure. This takes the form of one penalty die (for a Hard 
difficulty level) or two penalty dice (for an Extreme difficulty level). This 
rule does not apply to ranged and melee attacks, where the difficulty level 
cannot be pushed",You are a helpful AI assistant.

What happens when a player must use more than one skill?,"When  a  player  is  attempting  something  that  utilizes  more 
than  one  skill,  the  player  should  use  their  highest  level  of 
success. In the case of an opposed roll, the opponent’s highest 
level of success is used to oppose the player’s highest level of 
success. If the skill or characteristic called for is not listed on 
the investigator sheet, the Keeper should decide whether to allow 
its use or not, depending on the situation and the setting. 

The  Keeper  will  specify  whether  a  difficulty  level  is 
Regular, Hard, or Extreme, and the player will indicate whether 
they have a skill or characteristic that is above the difficulty 
level.  If  the  player  has  a  characteristic  that  exceeds  the 
difficulty  level  by  90  or  more,  the  chance  for  success  is 
100%. If this is the case, the skill or characteristic is so far 
beyond the difficulty level that it is not even possible to fail.

What is a Combat Round?,"In a combat round, all characters and monsters involved in the 
combat get a chance to act. The number of actions that can 
be made is equal to the number of movement actions that the 
character is able to make. 

In 6th Edition, the combat round is not a fixed unit of 
time and should be played dramatically. A combat round is 
a combat round. The duration of a combat is not measured 
in rounds; rather, the Keeper determines when a combat is 
over. The combat will end when the Keeper judges it to be 
so, usually when one side has been defeated. 

Dexterity and the Order of Attack 
The  question  of  who  gets  the  first  opportunity  to  attack 
can be an important issue in a fight. Determine the order 
of attack by ranking the combatants' DEX from highest to 
lowest. In the case of a draw, the side with the higher combat 
skill goes first.

Actions in a Combat Round
On  their  turn  in  the  DEX  order  (highest  to  lowest)  each 
character may use their action:

T  To initiate an attack using the Fighting, Firearms, or 

Throw skills.

"If more than one combatants want to attack, who has the right to attack first?","In a melee (a fight in a confined or crowded area), each combatant gets a turn in DEX order. If tied, the side with the higher combat skill goes first. If still tied, the character with the highest STR goes first. 

If characters are fighting multiple opponents, they may make a fighting maneuver against each of their opponents in a round. The number of attacks is limited by the number of opponents (see Fighting Back, page 106).

Characters and monsters that have more than one attack per round may also cast spells. The number of spells which can be cast in one round is equal to the number of attacks. 

In the case of a draw with an opponent that is casting spells, the Keeper should decide on the outcome. A character or monster that is casting a spell cannot use a weapon to attack unless the spell is a fighting maneuver (such as the Fighting spell in the Grimoire section) or unless the spell is specifically described as producing a weapon (such as Create Zombie).

A  character  that  is  being  attacked  may  fight  back  or  dodge. 
If fighting back, the target may use any of their weapons. The 
aim of fighting back is usually to inflict as much damage as possi-

In which situation is a character allowed to escape a close combat?,"A character is allowed to escape close combat if they make a successful DEX roll. 

i  If the character is physically restrained (pinned) by an opponent, they may use a maneuver of their own to push the 
restraint aside and break free. If the maneuver is successful the restraint is displaced and the character is free to act as they 
wish. If the maneuver is failed, the character does not move or act on their turn.

i  If  a  character  is  fighting  back  against  a  maneuver,  they  may  do  so  on  their  turn  in  the  order  of  combat,  or 
immediately if the maneuver allows it (such as when using the Fighting maneuver ""Seize"").

i  A  character  may  use  a  maneuver  to  fight  back  against  a  maneuver  made  by  an  opponent.  This  is  done  by 
making a Fighting roll at the end of the opponent’s turn in the order of combat, just before the opponent acts again. 
If the maneuver is successful, the opponent’s action does not cost them a movement action and they do not move.

How is a firearm attack resolved?,"In main combat, resolving a firearm attack is similar to resolving a 
melee  attack  (see  Melee  Combat,  page  103).  The  goal  is 
always  to  hit  the  target  with  the  firearm,  and  the  difficulty 
level is determined by the range and then by the level of diffi-
culty  that  the  target  presents  (remember  that  some  charac-
ters may be able to fire into the next combat round, while oth-
ers may only just be able to get a shot off in the following round, 
especially when those with a readied firearm are involved (see 
Firearms and the DEX Order, page 113).

Once the target has been placed in the DEX order, their position 
does not change, regardless of any subsequent changes to their 
DEX score.

Harvey (DEX 55) is fighting a deep one (DEX 60) and is 
receiving 1 penalty die in the DEX order. The deep one

How does a character recover from a major wound when the Major Wound box is checked?,"When the Major Wound box is checked, the character cannot recover 
on their own. The only way for the character to recover is with 
the use of a medic or through a successful First Aid roll. 

Recovery from a major wound takes 1D3 days. During this 
time the character is out of action and cannot be treated further 
by first aid. If a character is in a war zone, this recovery takes 
place in a field hospital. The Keeper may consult with the dice 
to determine if a major wound is healed during the investigator 
development  phase  of  a  war  game  (see  Wounds  and  Re-
covery, page 124).

If the roll is a fumble, the patient suffers a further injury. 
If the roll is a success, proceed with recovery.

Can you provide a short description of how a Chase takes place?,"In a Chase, characters and vehicles are lined up in order of their MOV (Movement) rating. 

G  Those with the highest MOV go first, with the highest going first, followed by those with the next highest MOV, and so on.

G  On each turn, every character and vehicle gets a turn in the order determined by their MOV rating.

G  A character or vehicle can use their action to move 

forward or backward.

G  A character can also use their action to perform some-

thing else that requires time and effort, such as picking a lock.

G  If a character has only one movement action, they can 

continue to move at full speed.

G  If a character has two movement actions, they may move 

a number of locations equal to their speed (see Movement Rate, 

page 33).

Hazards: A  character  may  spend  their  movement  action  to 

push through a hazard or simply to advance one location and 

hope to avoid any further hazards.

listed for that hazard. If the cost is more than the character’s

What is a speed roll used for during a chase?,"In a chase, speed rolls are used to establish the order in which participants move. 

First, all participants make a speed roll. Speed rolls are made with the aim of getting the highest or lowest result; it depends on the situation. 

When  two  characters  are  heading  in  the  same  direction, 
those with a speed that is 5 or more points lower than an oppo-
nent should make a CON roll for a penalty die, and those with a 
speed that is 5 or more points higher should get a bonus die. 

Those with speeds that differ by 3 or less should all make 
a  regular  roll.  If  there  is  a  lead  of  3  locations,  for  ex-
ample, the character with the higher speed would be 3 loca-
tions ahead and the chase would end immediately with the 
loser losing the chase.

If  the  pursuer  is  slower  than  the  fleeing  character, 
the  chase  is  not  started  and  the  Keeper  should  simply 
describe how the pursuer loses their quarry.

Dexterity and the Order of Movement
The  question  of ",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How many movements can a chase participant take per round?,"In a chase, each participant can move a number of times equal to their MOV rating. The default MOV rate is 7. This means that someone with MOV 7 can move 7 times in a round, someone with MOV 6 can move 6 times in a round, and so on. If someone has a MOV rate of zero, they are unable to move at all. 

The round is a unit of time that allows all participants in a chase an equal opportunity to act. A combat round is not the same as a real-world second: in a combat round, some characters may act once, others may act twice, and others not at all. 

Dexterity and the Order of Movement
A  character’s  DEX  (Difficulty  Level)  determines  the  order  of 

movement in a chase.

Starting with the character at the rear, rank the characters in 
order  of  their  DEX  (highest  to  lowest).  The  character  with 
the highest DEX goes first, followed by the next, and so on.

What methods can the Keeper use to create obstacles and hazards during a chase?,"When  presenting  a  chase,  you  should  create  a  string  of  ob-
stacles and hazards that offer the players a challenge. 

G  A  quiet  road  may  become  congested  with  traffic. 
G  A  quiet  neighborhood  street  may  become  a  place 
where  people  are  entering  and  leaving  homes  quickly, 
perhaps a drug den or illegal gambling joint.

G  A  hazard  may  cause  damage  and  delay,  but  it  will 
not impede one character more than another. The choice of 
route is down to the players. If they choose to take a risk, you 
should be ready for a dramatic incident to occur. 

G  A  chase  that  takes  place  on  even  terrain  will  soon 
descend  into  chaos.  Keep  the  chases  organized  and

How are vehicle damages computed after a collision?,"In 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu, vehicle damage is resolved using a comparison of the build values of the two vehicles involved in a collision. 

If the damage is less than the build of the vehicle that 
inflicted it, the vehicle takes half of the damage it inflicted 
and suffers the other half itself.

If the damage is more than the build of the vehicle that 
inflicted it, the vehicle is wrecked. It may explode, burn, roll 
or suffer some combination thereof. Those within the vehicle 
suffer an additional 1D10 damage.

A vehicle is also damaged when it is used to inflict an 
impaling or piercing injury on another vehicle or on an in-
animate object such as a tree or lamp post. The amount of 
damage is the same as for a similar attack using a natural 
weapon, such as a fist or a knife. If a vehicle is used to inflict 
damage on another vehicle, the latter must apply the “hazard” 
rule (see following) after taking the damage.

What state of insanity exist in the game?,"In the game of Call of Cthulhu, there are four main states of 
insanity, each with its own effects and duration.

1.  Temporary  Insanity:  This  is  the  standard  result  of 
being  exposed  to  the  Mythos,  and  usually  means  that  the 
investigator has had a bad dream or hallucination. Temporary 
insanity lasts for 1D10 hours.

2.  Indefinite Insanity: This occurs when the cumulative 
Sanity  loss  for  a  single  day  exceeds  the  investigator’s 
Sanity points. The player needs to make a Sanity roll at the 
end of the day or the next day or the next—whenever the 
Keeper thinks appropriate—or the investigator becomes in-
definitely insane. A roll is always required if Sanity points are 
lost as a result of encountering a Mythos tome (see page 163). 

3.  Permanent Insanity: When Sanity points are lost as a 
result of an investigator’s delusion (see page 154), or if an 
insane investigator fails a Reality Check (see page 164), the 
investigator becomes permanently insane. No recovery",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How many Sanity points must an investigator loose to become temporary insane?,"An investigator would lose 5 Sanity points in a single day to become temporary insane. Alternatively, if the cumulative loss of Sanity points in a single game day is equal to or greater than the investigator’s full Sanity (thus exceeding 95, 94, or 93 in the three scenarios above), the investigator has suffered a ""shocking"" loss and should immediately make an Intelligence roll. If the INT roll is failed, the investigator loses 1D6 Sanity points and becomes temporary insane.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
How is it decided how many hours temporary insanity lasts?,"In Call of Cthulhu, the duration of temporary insanity is 
determined by the player. When going insane, the player 
chooses one, two, or three (rolling 1D3) hours of real time 
over which the investigator loses 1D10 Sanity points.

Alternatively,  the  Keeper  may  decide  on  the  duration 
of  insanity  if  time  is  critical  (for  example,  in  a  chase 
scene) or if he or she wishes to avoid delays. To do this, the 
Keeper rolls 1D10 on the Insanity Duration chart.

Note: The effects of temporary and indefinite insanity are 
the same; the difference lies in duration.

Insanity Phase 1: A Bout of Madness

Insanity phase: a bout of madness, a round, a combat, a 
scene—whatever the period of game time may be. The bout 
may be summarized, but should not be skipped.

The investigator is immune to further Sanity point loss during 
the bout of madness. The Keeper may allow some or all of 
the investigator’s actions to be performed automatically, either 
good or bad, while in this state.

On recovering from a bout of madness",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is the best way to recover from Indefinite Insanity?,"Recovery from indefinite insanity can take a while. 

Recovery from temporary indefinite insanity can happen in one of two ways.

First, the character can make a Sanity roll at the end of each 
month. If the roll is successful, the character has recovered and 
returns to normal. 

Second,  the  character  can  recover  faster  if  they  find  a 
good therapist. With the help of a therapist, an insane investiga-
tor can attempt a Sanity roll once per session. If the roll is suc-
cessful, the investigator is cured of their indefinite insanity and 
returns to normal. A therapist can help an investigator to recover 
from temporary insanity quickly—usually within a few weeks. 

Indefinite insanity can be cured only by the intervention of 
another character (at the Keeper’s discretion), or by a successful 
Sanity roll (if alone, or if the therapist is insane). Treatment 
by  a  non-psychotherapist  can  add  1D10  percentiles  to  the

How can a character learn a spell?,"In the Cthulhu Mythos, learning a spell can take many forms, 
and often involves a degree of horror, trauma, or sacrifice. 

Finding a Book of Spells
The most common way to learn a spell is to find a book that 
contains the spell and study the book. Many Mythos books are 
written by crazies, cultists, and alien beings, and such books 
usually have the spell in both an English translation and the 
original, often bizarre, nomenclature. Some books are writ-
ten so that the spell can be found in one language and only the 
key or clue to understanding the spell in another. Sometimes 
the books are partially or completely written in an unknown 
language, requiring the Keeper to decide what is written and, 
if necessary, make translation rolls for the investigators.

The  investigators  may  also  learn  a  spell  by  finding  a 
written copy of it. A Hard Own Language roll may be required 
to decipher the text. If the roll is failed, the reader gains no 
benefit from having studied the book. It is up to the Keeper 
whether a translation is required or if the original language can 
be understood. A full study of a tome",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What type of roll must a player do to cast a spell?,"In most cases, to cast a spell the player must make a successful POW roll.",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What happens when a spell casting roll fails?,"When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  pushed  and  failed,  the  caster 
should  consider  themselves  fortunate  if  they  are  no  more 
than 5 miles away from the target when the spell fails. If this was 
a casting of Create Zombie, for example, the corpse stands up, 
only half-decomposed, and attacks the caster. The caster may 
flee and live to try again another day.

If  the  caster  is  further  than  5  miles  from  the  target  when 
the  spell  fails,  the  caster  is  safe  from  retribution  but  the 
magic point loss is doubled.

If the caster is harmed when a pushed spell fails, a Luck roll 
must be made to determine if they have also lost Sanity points as 
well. If the Luck roll is failed, the caster loses one Sanity point for 
each magic point they expended on the spell.

What information is advised that the Keeper gives to the players before they create their investigators?,"Before the players create their investigators, it is advised that the Keeper provides the players with some basic information regarding what sort of game you intend to run. This will give the players the opportunity to create investigators that will 
fit in with the theme of your campaign. 

If your campaign is set in the modern day, the players may be able to 
create investigators who are all in their twenties, all be friends and 
all investigators of the same profession—no problem. However, if 
you are switching from a modern-day setting to a historical one, or 
vice versa, then some care is required. 

When switching from a modern-day setting to a historical one, 
the change will most often be from 0 to 100 years back in time. 
The Keeper may wish to introduce a sudden death or loss of in-
vestigator  skills  as  the  investigators  find  themselves  out  of 
their  own  time,  struggling  to  comprehend  the  unfamiliar 
surroundings.  A  sudden  transition  from  being  a  1920s  ex-

What are NPCs?,"NPC stands for Non-Player Character. An NPC is a term used in 
role-playing games, most commonly in role-playing games of the 
fantasy genre, such as Call of Cthulhu. An NPC is any person 
(or being) in the game who is not a player character. Essentially 
they are the “extras” in a film, a population of characters for the 
players to interact with during play. 

You are encouraged to create an NPC simply by naming him 
or her. Give the investigator a picture in their mind; something 
to  help  them  visualize  the  person.  You  don’t  have  to  be 
concerned with more than the basics of an NPC—name, relation-
ship  to  the  investigators,  and  a  few  personality  traits,  and 
perhaps a couple of roleplaying hints. 

When an investigator encounters an NPC for the first time, 
you should take the opportunity to establish the nature of the 
relationship between the investigator and the NPC. There may 
only be one or two possibilities, and you can usually determine 
the correct one by considering the investigator’s background. 
If the NPC is an acquaintance or friend, you should de",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What is an Idea Roll?,"In some roleplaying games, especially those in the Horror genre, 
the Idea Roll is used. This is rolled when a player lacks ideas how 
to proceed. An Idea Roll is a 1D100 roll. 

Firstly, if the Keeper has mentioned something that may be of 
use to the players, but has since gone unnoticed, and the players 
are stuck, the Keeper may offer a second chance to the players, 
allowing them to make an Idea roll.

Secondly,  the  players  can  call  for  an  Idea  roll.  Each 
player that calls for an Idea roll allows their investigator to gain 
a second chance. The Keeper might allow the use of the Idea roll 
even if the players have previously failed an Idea roll, but this is 
at the Keeper’s discretion.

Thirdly,  the  Keeper  may  call  for  an  Idea  roll  if  the 
players are stuck and no one knows what to do next. In this case 
the dice are rolled and the players must go with the result.

The consequence of an Idea roll is always to move the game 

on to the next chapter. 

Idea rolls may be called for by the players or the Keeper",You are a helpful AI assistant.
What are the Mythos Tomes,"A  vast  and  disturbing  array  of  dark  knowledge  awaits  in  the 
forgotten  tomes  of  the  Cthulhu  Mythos.  Each  book  describes 
a different approach to understanding the Cthulhu Mythos, as well 
as  different  ways  of  trying  to  reduce  the  Mythos  to  some 
comprehensible structure. No one person can read everything, 
and even if they could, the sheer volume of books would pro-
vide a mountain of information that is impossible to assimilate. 
The  Cthulhu  Mythos  is  not  a  single  entity,  but  more  of 
a  common  term  used  to  describe  a  range  of  unnatural, 
supernatural, and unproven scientific concepts and entities, 
and  such  a  term  is  more  easily  defined  and  approached 
through the use of a skill than a characteristic.

When was the Key of Solomon written?,"The  authorship  and  exact  date  of  composition  of  the  Key 
of Solomon are unknown. The book was not written by Solomon, 
a king of Israel in the tenth century BC, as the title might sug-
gest. The version most commonly available today is a medieval 
translation, possibly from Greek, though the original may have 
been written in Arabic or Latin. 

The book purports to be a translation of magical writings of 
the Jewish sage King Solomon (c. 970-930 BC), written as a man-
uscript in the Latin version and circulated privately among the 
wealthy and powerful. 

The first known printing was in Germany in the early sixteenth 
century, as a folio edition, again privately circulated. The text 
is in Latin on the inside leaves of a black binding, in a black let-
terpress typesetting. A copy is held by the British Museum.

What are the main spell classes?,"In the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, spells are classed into 
eight groups, each reflecting the type of magic they represent.

First Spell: A first spell can be any spell the Keeper wants, 
but it sets the tone for the rest of the investigator’s magical 
career. It should be a significant spell, one that will have an 
impact  upon  the  investigator’s  life  and  that  of  those 
around him or her. The first spell can come from any school 
of magic. The Keeper should take note of the spell for later 
(see The First Spell, page 97).

Learning a Spell from a Mythos Book
Followers of the Mythos acknowledge that the knowledge of 
the Gods is not to be found in the mundane and that true 
learning and enlightenment comes from the study of the dark 
and unknown. A tome of eldritch lore is the gateway to the 
Mythos and the source of the spell’s creation and understanding 
is beyond human comprehension. It is suggested that those 
who study the Mythos and its contents suffer some insidious 
corruption,  either  to  their  mind,  body,  or  spirit,  which

Which spell can a cultist use to get in touch with alien races?,"A cultist is most likely to know the Contact Deity spells, 
which  allow  communication  with  a  deity  or  major  god. 
Contact  spells  do  not  require  any  special  preparation.  An 
alternative  to  Contact  spells  is  the  Contact  Deity  spell,  if 
available in your game, which combines Contact Chaos and Con-
tact  Deity.  Contact  spells  do  not  require  POW  rolls,  though 
the casting time may be greater on some occasions. 

Contact  spells  do  not  give  the  caster  the  upper  hand 
when  negotiating  with  the  contacted  entity;  it  is  a  one-way 
communication. The caster asks a question and the entity re-
sponds—there is no negotiation, only a one-way message.

Contact  spells  do  not  require  any  sacrifice  or  other 
torture,  but  some  do  require  certain  conditions,  such  as

If you are looking for a term for a device that can communicate with people in the past or future then you could use the following as inspiration:

i  A  telephone  that  works  with  a  special  liquid  carri-
er rather than normal air.

i  A  computer  with  a  special  program  that  allows  the 
user to access other dimensions and times.

on, allows the user to speak to the past or future.

What characteristics are typically possessed by monsters and beasts?,"In  most  cases,  monsters  and  beasts  do  not  have  charac-
teristics  listed  for  Strength,  Constitution,  Size,  Intelligence, 
Power,  or  Education.  When  these  beings  are  encountered, 
the Keeper should decide on the spot whether these characteristics 
should be used or ignored. 

SIZ and DEX are usually important for physical creatures. 
INT and POW might be important to the Keeper, but only 
rarely would other characteristics be significant. 

When a non-player character or monster is involved in a 
conflict, the Keeper should use the skill or characteristic that 
would be most advantageous to the non-player character or 
monster. For example, when fighting back against a human 
opponent, a deep one would normally use its Fighting (Brawling) skill. However, when fighting back against a larger 
creature, it may use its Bulk or its Dodge skill. 

When using a non-player character or monster in a fight,

Constitution is a characteristic that determines the physical and 
mental robustness of the investigator. A CON roll can be used 
to  gauge  the  investigator’s  endurance,  stamina,  and  overall 
health. A high Constitution means that the investigator recovers

isons and other harmful substances.

What is a Crawling One composed of?,"Crawling ones are composed of a soft, slimy, semi-liquid substance, not wholly incompatible with the normal dimensions of space. When this substance hardens it takes a rigid, immobile, and lifeless form. The 
crawling ones themselves are inside, alive and active, but imprisoned in their own rigid shells. The only way to free a crawling one is to smash its shell, which costs the victim 1D6 hit points per 
point of damage inflicted. When a crawling one is finally freed, it crawls out of its shell and disappears. 

Crawling ones can burrow through almost any material, including steel and stone, and can thus reach a target 
anywhere if it can reach a point near enough to it. The burrowing cost is the same as for burrowing through stone. 

They often serve Gla'aki in his attacks on those who have become trapped in the margins of time.
