1. **Rolling an Intelligence check**: In D&D 5th edition, players often roll an Intelligence check to cast a spell, especially for spells that require concentration or have a high DC (Difficulty Class).
2. **Rolling a Spell Attack**: Some spells require a Spell Attack roll, which involves rolling a d20 and adding the spell's attack bonus, the caster's proficiency bonus, and the spell's attack bonus. This is typically used for spells that deal damage or have a chance to hit a target.
3. **Rolling a Wisdom (Insight) check**: In some cases, a Wisdom (Inspection) check might be required to cast a spell, especially for spells that require insight or perception.

**D20 System (D&D 5th Edition):**

1. **Spell Fails to Cast**: The spell is not cast, and the spell caster must try again.
2. **Spell Effect is Reduced or Altered**: The spell's effect is diminished or altered in some way, such as reduced damage, a different target, or an unintended consequence.
3. **Spell Has Unintended Consequences**: The spell has an unexpected effect, such as harming the spell caster or affecting an unintended target.
4. **Spell is Disrupted**: The spell is disrupted, and the spell caster must make a new roll to recover or re-cast the spell.

What are NPCs?,"NPC stands for Non-Player Character. In the context of video games, movies, and literature, an NPC is a character that is controlled by the game or story, rather than a player.

In video games, NPCs can be found in various roles, such as:

1. **Shopkeepers**: Selling items or services to the player.

3. **Enemies**: Engaging in combat with the player.
4. **Allies**: Assisting the player in their quest.
5. **Neutral characters**: Offering quests, information, or services to the player.

In movies and literature, NPCs can be used to add depth and realism to the story, making the world feel more immersive and engaging.

The term ""NPC"" originated from the early days of video games, where these characters were often non-player controlled, meaning they were not controlled by a human player. Over time, the term has become widely used in various forms of media to describe any character that is not a main protagonist or player character."

In the context of science fiction, a Temporal Communicator is often used to facilitate communication between different eras, allowing individuals to ask questions, receive information, or even warn people about future events. However, the use of such a device raises complex questions about the potential consequences of altering the timeline or interfering with the course of history.
