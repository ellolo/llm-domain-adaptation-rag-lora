How many Sanity points must an investigator loose to become temporary insane?,Five or more,8,"In the context of the popular tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons, the amount of Sanity points lost to become ""insane"" can vary depending on the specific rules and edition of the game being played.

In general, in the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, a character can become insane if they lose a certain number of Sanity points. According to the Player's Handbook (p. 146), a character can become insane if they lose 5 or more Sanity points.

However, it's worth noting that the game master (GM) can also impose additional penalties or effects on a character's Sanity score, which can make it more difficult for them to remain sane.

In some cases, a character may also become insane due to external factors, such as exposure to certain magical effects, supernatural events, or the influence of certain creatures or objects.

It's also worth noting that the concept of Sanity in D&D is a bit more nuanced than just losing points. Sanity is a measure of a character's mental state, and it can be affected by various factors, such as fear, stress, and trauma. A character can become ""unstable"" or ""broken"" if their Sanity score drops to 0, but they may still retain some level of mental function.
