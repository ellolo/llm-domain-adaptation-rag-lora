According to Lovecraft, Abdul Al-Hazred was an Arab sage

city of Damascus, where he studied the teachings of Jere-mi-
ah  (Ibrahim)  and  became  a  priest  of  the  dark  god  Nodens 
(known as Dagon in Arabic). Al-Hazred’s first language was 
Arabic,  but  he  also  became  proficient  in  Chaldean,  Greek, 
Latin, and Persian. He wrote the Al Azif in his early twenties, 
completing it in the year 730. The work was an immediate 
success  among  the  inhabitants  of  Damascus,  but  its  fame 
spread quickly and soon people were coming from all over the 
Middle East to hear him read from the book. Al-Hazred’s age 
at the time was about 26. He lived for another 450 years or 
so, although very little is known about his life during that

The Necronomicon is not a real book, and its existence is not recognized by scholars or historians. However, it is often associated with the works of H.P. Lovecraft, who wrote extensively about the Cthulhu Mythos in his stories.

In the context of Lovecraft's works, the Necronomicon is often referred to as a mysterious, ancient tome that contains forbidden knowledge and forbidden secrets. It is said to be a powerful artifact that holds the secrets of the Old Ones, ancient beings of immense power and malevolence.

The Necronomicon is often attributed to the fictional Arab scholar Abdul Alhazred, who supposedly wrote it in the 8th century. However, the actual writing of the Necronomicon as a fictional book is attributed to Lovecraft himself.

In the Lovecraftian mythos, the Necronomicon is said to contain forbidden knowledge about the Old Ones, ancient deities that lurk in the shadows, waiting to reclaim the world. The book is often associated with the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe created by Lovecraft and other authors.

It's worth noting that the Necronomicon has been the subject of much speculation and controversy over the years, with some people believing it to be a real book or a genuine grimoire.

The Necronomicon is attributed to the Arab Abdul Al-hazred, who wrote it in the 12th century. However, the version that Lovecraft used as his source was apparently a Greek translation, although the original Arabic version has also been mentioned. 

The Greek version was apparently written by Theodoras Philetas in the 15th century. It was from this version that Lovecraft got most of his information about the Necronomicon. 

Other versions and partial copies of the Necronomicon exist. A Latin version was apparently made in the 15th century, as was a German version. A complete Arabic version is held by the British Museum. 

In 1915, a copy of the Greek version of the Necronomicon was discovered by Dr. John Dee, a consultant to Queen Elizabeth the First of England.

Abdul Alhazred is the commonly accepted author of the classic 
Necronomicon translation, the Greek Necronomicon. He lived in 
the 12th century and is believed to have originated the work. How-

work at all, but rather it is a translation of his writings by a Greek 
scholar, Theodoras Philetas, living in the 12th century. 

Other languages and partial translations are also known to exist. 
The  exact  number  of  Necronomicon  translations  and  partial

In the stories, the Necronomicon is often referred to as a forbidden book that contains ancient and forbidden knowledge, written in a language that is not fully understood by humans. The book is said to hold the secrets of the Old Ones, ancient beings who ruled the Earth before humans.

Keeper of Arcane Lore) and two players to roleplay investigators. More players can join in as investigators. Some versions of games 
have different rules for solo play, where one player plays the investigator and also takes on the role of Keeper.

It is not possible to have a game with only one player, as the interactive nature of the game is based on discussion and de-
cision-making between players. Roleplaying is about people, people in an atmosphere of fear, excitement, surprise, confusion, 
laughter, and adventure.

ever, as the number of players increases, so does the amount of organization and preparation required. 

Three to five players are ideal. With this many players, everyone gets a chance to play a variety of investigators and non-player

maximum number of dice would be a home-made or custom 
game, but a good example is the 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu 
ruleset’s melee combat. In it, a player rolls no less than two 
dice. Ideally, the number of dice rolled should set the difficulty 
level for the skill or characteristic used in the roll.

Arts  (Brawl)  is  one",,,,"The  minimum  number  of  players  needed  to  play  is  three:  two

In fact, the ideal number of players is four: three investigators and 
one Keeper. With this number, everyone has a say in the game and 
everyone has a character to control. If more players turn up, they 
may be able to play non-player characters. 

Investigators can be played as cooperators or competitors. 

You may wish to begin with a shorter scenario, one that can be 
completed in one session. A published scenario has guidelines 
for experienced investigators, as well as a more difficult level 
for novices. As Keeper, you may wish to start with the diffi-
cult level for your group and adjust it from there.

we recommend that you start with a beginner scenario, such as

2. ""The Call of Cthulhu"" (1928) - This short story mentions the university as a place where the protagonist, Francis Wayland Thurston, discovers a mysterious cult.
3. ""At the Mountains of Madness"" (1936) - This novella features the university as a place where the protagonist, William Dyer, is a professor and discovers ancient, alien artifacts.
4. ""The Dreams in the Witch House"" (1932) - This short story features the university as a place where the protagonist, Brown, is a student.
5. ""The Whisperer in Darkness"" (1931) - This short story features the university as a place where the protagonist, Albert N. Wilmarth, is a student.

**General Tips**

1. **Leveling up**: Most games have a leveling system where players can level up their characters or equipment to increase their stats or skills. This is usually done by completing quests, defeating enemies, or collecting experience points.
2. **Equipment upgrades**: Some games allow players to upgrade their equipment, such as guns, swords, or armor, to improve their skills. Upgrading equipment can increase its damage output, range, or other relevant stats.
3. **Skill trees or skill trees**: Many games have a skill tree or skill tree system where players can allocate points to different skills or abilities, such as shooting, melee, or magic. This can increase the player's overall effectiveness in combat.
4. **Practice and experimentation**: As players progress through the game, they may encounter new enemies or situations that require them to use different skills or strategies. Experimenting with different tactics and techniques can help players improve their skills.

Here are some common ways to improve weapon skills:

1.  **Leveling Up**: As players progress through the game, they often gain experience points (XP) for completing quests, killing enemies, or achieving certain milestones. When they accumulate enough XP, they level up, which can increase their overall skill level, including their weapon skills.
2.  **Skill Trees or Perks**: Many games feature skill trees or perk systems that allow players to allocate points to specific skills or abilities. By investing points in the relevant skill tree or perk, players can improve their weapon skills, such as increasing damage output, accuracy, or critical hit chance.
3.  **Equipment Upgrades**: Upgrading equipment, such as guns, swords, or bows, can improve their effectiveness and increase the player's overall damage output. This can be achieved by collecting better equipment, crafting new gear, or purchasing upgrades from vendors.
4.  **Training or Practice**: Some games allow players to practice their skills through training exercises or mini-games. This can help improve their accuracy, speed, or technique, making them more effective with their chosen weapon.
5.  **",,,,"In most roleplaying games, weapon skills can be improved through use and practice. Here are some general methods that may be 
applicable to your game:

i  Practice:  Using  the  weapon  successfully  in  a  combat  yields  experience  points  and  a  rise  in  skill.  Each  use 
of the skill in play is a chance to gain experience points and so rise in skill. Each skill gain might also allow the use of 
more advanced techniques with the weapon.

i  Training:  Formal  tuition  from  a  tutor  is  the  best  way  to  learn  a  skill.  The  tutor  may  be  a  fellow  investigator, 
a professor, or even a criminal enabler. The Keeper may make a skill roll to determine the success of the teaching. A Luck 
roll may also be required. The student can then gain double the normal amount of skill points for a successful roll. The tutor 
must be at least as skilled in the subject as the student. The teacher and student must work without interruption. The student 
can gain a maximum of 20 skill points in one learning roll. This cannot be gained in a single game session,",,,,"In  Call  of  Cthulhu,  a  character  may  increase  a  skill  by 
up to 10 percentage points with a successful roll against that skill 
during the investigator development phase. This is known as a 
""tick"". The character must have a skill value less than 50 before 
a tick can be gained. 

A skill can be ticked multiple times. Each tick adds 10 skill 
points (which are gained in the investigator development phase 
of play). When an increase of 10% is added to a skill, add 1 
to the skill base number. Thus, if a character has a 41% Fire-
arms (Rifle) skill, and this is increased to 51% by a tick, the 
base number is increased to 5. Any further increases of 10% 
are added to the base number: 55%, 65%, 75%, and so on.

familiar, they may use the ""Fighting"" skill. For example, if an 
investigator were to use an axe (a weapon with which most 
people are not familiar), it would require a ""Fighting (Axe)"" 
skill. If the weapon is one that the investigator is not familiar

During hypnosis, a person is typically guided by a trained hypnotherapist or self-induced through self-hypnosis techniques. The goal is to access the subconscious mind, where thoughts, emotions, and memories are stored, and make positive changes to improve various aspects of life, such as:

1. **Anxiety and stress management**: Hypnosis can help reduce anxiety, fear, and stress by teaching relaxation techniques and reprogramming negative thought patterns.

1. **The task's complexity**: The DM assesses the complexity of the task and how difficult it is to accomplish. This includes considering the number of steps required, the level of skill involved, and any obstacles or challenges that need to be overcome.
2. **The character's level**: The DM takes into account the character's level and their proficiency in the skill. Higher-level characters are generally considered more challenging than lower-level characters.

Here are some common ways games handle multiple skills:

Here are some possible outcomes:

1. **Combining skills**: In some cases, the player can combine multiple skills to achieve a more complex outcome. For example, a character with both magic and combat skills might use magic to weaken an enemy and then use their combat skills to finish them off.
2. **Prioritizing skills**: The player may need to prioritize which skills to use first, depending on the situation. For instance, in a puzzle game, a player might need to use their problem-solving skills to figure out a puzzle, and then use their memory skills to recall the solution.
3. **Switching between skills**: In some games, the player can switch between different skills quickly, such as in a fighting game where a character can switch between different fighting styles or special moves.
4. **Overlapping skills**: In some cases, the player's skills may overlap or complement each other, allowing them to perform a more complex action. For example, a character with both stealth and hacking skills might use stealth to sneak past a guard and then use their hacking skills to disable a security system",,,,"When  a  player  is  attempting  something  that  utilizes  more 
than  one  skill,  the  player  should  use  their  highest  level  of

success. If the skill or characteristic called for is not listed on 
the investigator sheet, the Keeper should decide whether to allow 
its use or not, depending on the situation and the setting. 

The  Keeper  will  specify  whether  a  difficulty  level  is 
Regular, Hard, or Extreme, and the player will indicate whether 
they have a skill or characteristic that is above the difficulty 
level.  If  the  investigator’s  chosen  skill  or  characteristic 
exceeds  the  difficulty  level  set  by  the  Keeper,  the  player 
deals  the  damage  or  achieves  the  desired  outcome  with  a

Idea Rolls
An  Idea  roll  is  a  1D100  roll.  An  Idea  roll  may  be  called 
for by the Keeper whenever a player lacks an obvious idea for how 
to proceed. An investigator could try to pick a lock, for example, 
but in the absence of an Idea roll, the Keeper might not know 
whether to succeed or fail. An Idea roll is used to resolve that 
uncertainty. An Idea roll is also used to determine if a character 
is able to make a spontaneous use of a skill (see Chapter 5: 
Skills).

An  Idea  roll  is  different  for  each  situation.  The  Keeper 
describes  a  situation  and  asks  for  an  Idea  roll  from  one 
character in the game at a time. The player describes what he or 
she intends to do and the Keeper tells whether an Idea roll is re-
quired and, if so, who should make it. The Keeper is the arbiter

Cash and Assets:  The  standard  rules  are  usually  sufficient. 
However, if you wish to incorporate more complexity, you might 
consider allowing the players to spend their cash however they 
like (within reason), and record the remaining amount. This is 
how they wish to allocate their funds. 

Movement Rate:  The  standard  rules  use  a  movement  ac-

may wish to use a more detailed method, such as tracking each 
movement  action,  or  even  using  meters  or  inches  on  the 
playing surface.

characters may have a bite, a kick and a fist, and are able to 
make all three attacks in one round. Others may only have one 
attack and so only get one opportunity to attack in a round. 
Those with multiple attacks may also have multiple attacks of the

It is a standard period of time during which a specific sequence of actions or events occurs, such as the exchange of blows, the execution of a technique, or the resolution of a confrontation.

In combat sports like boxing, mixed martial arts (MMA), and fencing, a round typically lasts for a set duration, usually 1-3 minutes, with a brief rest period (called a ""rest"" or ""intermission"") in between rounds. The duration of a round can vary depending on the specific sport or competition.

In a combat scenario, a round might refer to a specific sequence of actions or events, such as:

1. A round of gunfire, where a group of soldiers or a single shooter fires a set number of shots.
2. A round of hand-to-hand combat, where two or more individuals engage in a physical confrontation.
3. A round of a martial arts match, where competitors exchange techniques and strategies.

In 6th Edition, the combat round is not a fixed unit of 
time and should be played dramatically. A combat round is 
a combat round. The duration of a combat is not measured 
in rounds; rather, the Keeper determines when a combat is 
over. The combat will end when the Keeper judges it to be 
so, usually when one side has been defeated. 

Dexterity and the Order of Attack 
The  question  of  who  gets  the  first  opportunity  to  attack 
can be an important issue in a fight. Determine the order 
of attack by ranking the combatants' DEX from highest to 
lowest. In the case of a draw, the side with the higher combat 
skill goes first.

Actions in a Combat Round
On  their  turn  in  the  DEX  order  (highest  to  lowest)  each 
character may use their action:

T  To initiate an attack using the Fighting, Firearms, or 

Throw skills.

T",,,,"In  a  combat  round  (also  known  as  a  combat  turn  or  a 
round),  every  participant  in  the  combat  gets  a  chance  to 
act. This usually means that everyone rolls dice to determine 
what actions their investigator takes. The options for what can 
be rolled are decided by the Keeper and player. 

A  combat  round  does  not  have  to  be  a  second,  but  it 
usually is.  Time  moves  at  the  Keeper’s  discretion,  but  for 
this to be the case the Keeper must be clear about what a round 
represents in the story. A combat round could be 1 minute, but 
it could also be 30 seconds, 10 seconds, or even 1 second—what 
it represents is relative to the story. 

The  duration  of  a  combat  round  should  not  be  set  at 
the outset; it may alter during the course of the fight. The Keep-
er should judge the duration of a combat round according to the 
circumstances. For example, when multiple shots are fired, each 
shot",,,
"The combatant with the highest DEX. In case of draw, the combatant with highest combat skill",The combatant with the highest DEX.,,,,"If more than one character wants to attack, the character with 
the highest DEX takes first action. If there is a tie, the character 
with the highest Fighting skill goes next. If there is still a tie, the 
character with the highest value for STR goes next, and so on. 
Note that this is in contrast to the order of combat in a film or 
TV show, where the coolest or strongest character usually gets to 
act first.

Once the order of attack has been determined, stick with it, 
even  if  one  of  the  combatants  manages  to  knock  out  an-
other during the course of the fight. Continue with the initiative 
order as if nothing has happened. Of course, if a character is 
knocked  out,  their  final  action  will  bring  the  combat  to  a 
conclusion (see Conclusion of Combat, page 108).

1. **Last Man Standing**: In this scenario, the last person or entity standing is usually considered the winner. This is often used in games like ""last man standing"" or ""last one standing"" challenges.
2. **First to Attack**: In this scenario, the first person or entity to make a move or attack is considered the aggressor and is usually responsible for defending against subsequent attacks.
3. **Random Draw**: In some cases, a random draw can be used to determine who goes first. This can be done by rolling a die, drawing a card, or using a random algorithm.
4. **Agreed Upon**: In some situations, combatants may agree on who goes first or who attacks first. This can be done through verbal agreement or through a pre-arranged protocol.

round, each taking a single attack at the Keeper’s discretion. Note that this is exceptional; most creatures will fight one at a time even if tied for DEX.

Once the order of combat is determined, stick with it until everyone has had their turn; do not interrupt one fighter in mid-attack to allow another to attack.

range for each category is written in brackets after the skill.

its base range, however for each additional range increment the 
user must make a difficulty level of roll. If the attack is made

When a character's wound is marked as a Major Wound, it indicates that they have suffered a serious injury that requires significant recovery time.

To recover from a Major Wound, the character typically needs to spend time resting and receiving medical attention. The exact recovery process can vary depending on the game system and the specific rules being used. However, here are some general steps that a character might follow to recover from a Major Wound:

1. **Rest**: The character needs to rest for a certain amount of time, which can be measured in days, weeks, or even months, depending on the severity of the wound and the character's constitution. During this time, they may not be able to engage in any strenuous activities or participate in combat.
2. **Medical Attention**: The character may need to seek medical attention from a healer, a cleric, or a skilled medic. This can involve receiving treatment, such as bandaging, stitching, or applying poultices, to help the wound heal.
3. **Healing**: The character's wounds begin to heal, and they regain",,,,"In Call of Cthulhu, when a character receives a Major Wound,

they must make a CON roll at the end of the round (if fight-
ing hand-to-hand) or when they take their next damage roll (if

failed, the character dies.

If  the  character  is  stabilized,  they  must  make  a  CON

–20, etc.) and, in that moment, the Major Wound box is unticked by the Keeper. The character does not make a CON 
roll to recover from a Major Wound if their current hit points fall to 0 or below, as they are unconscious and thus unable 
to act. A character cannot die as a result of a Major Wound if their current hit points are already at 0; the Major Wound 
will leave them unconscious but alive.

1. **Stabilization**: The character is stabilized by a medical professional, such as a cleric or a skilled healer, who applies first aid and stabilizes the wound.
2. **Rest and Treatment**: The character is given time to rest and receive treatment. This can include applying bandages, administering medicine, or performing surgery.
3. **Healing**: The character begins to heal, with the severity of the wound and the character's Constitution score influencing the rate of healing. A character with a higher Constitution score will heal faster.
4. **Hit Point Recovery**: The character regains hit points equal to a certain amount, usually 1d8 + the character's Constitution modifier per day. This can be a gradual process, with the character regaining hit points over time.
5. **Additional Complications**: Depending on the severity of the wound, the character may experience additional complications, such as infection, organ damage, or long-term effects like scars or disabilities.

chapter 6: combatEven with the best of medicine, no person can consistently 
regenerate from more than a few hit points of damage per 
day. The only way to regain hit points equal to the character’s 
maximum hit point total is through the use of magic (see Lec-
thanians, page 248, for an exception). 

When the damage from a Major Wound is healed, the Major 
Wound box should be ticked. When all damage has been healed, 
the character recovers consciousness if unconscious, and any dying 
checks are recovered from. 

Recovering from a Major Wound takes at least a week, and 
typically requires a full week of rest in a hospital or other medi-
cal facility. The use of a hospital will speed recovery (see Dying 
and  Recovery,  page  124).  A  Major  Wound  Recovery  roll 
should be made at the end of each week of game time that a 
character is in hospital. If a character is not in hospital, but is

The Keeper describes the locations and the actions that each character takes, and the players declare where they wish to go and what actions they wish to take. The Keeper will ask for a roll under a particular skill or characteristic, usually Strength or Dexterity, to test whether the character achieves their goal. 

The Keeper will always describe the outcome of the dice roll, not just the success or failure of the roll. For example, if the player rolls under their DEX to avoid a blow, the Keeper might say, “You sidestep and manage to avoid the blow, but in doing so you lose your balance and find yourself flying through the air, landing awkwardly in the next room.” 

The player has just described an action, so now it is the Keeper’s turn. The Keeper considers what will most likely happen next.

Here's a brief overview of how a Chase typically occurs:

1. **Initiation**: A customer initiates a transaction, such as a deposit, withdrawal, or payment, by contacting a bank branch or using an online banking platform.
2. **Authorization**: The customer provides identification and confirms the transaction details, such as the amount, account number, and purpose of the transaction.
3. **Authorization**: The bank verifies the customer's identity and confirms the transaction details to ensure it is legitimate.
4. **Authorization**: The bank processes the transaction, which may involve debiting or crediting the customer's account.
5. **Clearing**: The transaction is then sent to the central clearinghouse, where it is matched with other transactions of the same type and amount.
6. **Settlement**: The clearinghouse verifies the transaction details and settles the amount in the customer's account.
7. **Confirmation**: The bank confirms the transaction has been settled, and the customer receives a confirmation of the transaction details.

1. **Physical Chase**: In a physical chase, one person or entity pursues another, often in a desperate attempt to catch up or overtake. This can occur in various settings, such as:
	* A police chase: A law enforcement officer or vehicle pursues a suspect or a vehicle that has committed a crime or is fleeing from the law.
	* A wild animal chase: A predator, such as a lion or a bear, chases its prey, like a deer or an antelope.
	* A sports chase: In sports like track and field, a runner or cyclist chases another competitor to overtake them and win the race.
2. **Chase in a Story or Movie**: In a narrative context, a chase can be a plot device used to create tension and suspense. This can involve:
	* A hero or protagonist being pursued by a villain or antagonist, often with the goal of escaping danger or achieving a goal.
	* A character being chased by a monster, ghost, or supernatural entity.
	* A high-stakes chase, such as a treasure hunt or a mission to retrieve a valuable item.
",,,,"A  chase  in  your  story  or  game  will  probably  involve  a  mix-
ture of characters, some on foot and others in vehicles. The 
characters in the chase are divided into two groups: those that 
are trying to catch the others (the pursuers) and those that are 
trying to escape (the fleeing characters). 

The Keeper should take note of all the participants in the 
chase and position them in order of fastest to slowest. A chase 
may start with multiple pursuers and fleeing characters, or it may 
start with only one of each. As the chase unfolds, characters may 
appear or disappear. A location is chosen as a starting point, 
usually when the pursuers and fleeing characters are far enough 
apart for a chase to be established. 

The chase is divided into a series of locations, each one a 
chance for a character to move, for an event to occur, for a 
character to be caught or for a character to lose the quarry. The 
Keeper picks a number of locations in advance and is prepared 
to roleplay what is to be found there. The players have no idea 
how many locations there will be or what they will encounter.

The",,,,"In a chase, the fleeing character (the quarry) attempts to lose their pursuer (the pursuer). 

1.  The  fleeing  character  declares  their  intended  direction  of 
escape. All other characters then declare whether they are speeding 
to help the quarry escape (assisting the fleeing character) or 
pursue the fleeing character.

2.  The  fleeing  character  makes  a  skill  roll  to  determine  if 
they are caught. The pursuer makes a skill roll to catch up. Both 
sides  roll  against  their  own  skill  (or  characteristic),  and  the 
Keeper compares the two rolls to determine if the pursuer has 
caught up with the fleeing character. 

3.  If  the  pursuer  is  faster,  they  gain  1  movement  action 
for each location by which they are ahead. If the pursuer is not 
faster, the chase is at its most intense and the Keeper may choose 
to increase the level of difficulty of the skill rolls made by both 
sides.

A chase is a pursuit of someone or something, often involving a sequence of events where one entity (the pursuer) tries to catch up to or overtake another entity (the pursued). Here's a general outline:

1. **Initiation**: The chase begins when the pursuer becomes aware of the pursued's location, often due to a trigger such as a crime, a mistake, or a deliberate action.
2. **Pursuit**: The pursuer sets out to catch up to the pursued, often using various means such as vehicles, foot, or other modes of transportation.
3. **Evasion**: The pursued attempts to evade the pursuer, using tactics like hiding, changing direction, or using obstacles to slow down the pursuer.
4. **Chase sequence**: The pursuer and pursued engage in a back-and-forth sequence of actions, with the pursuer trying to close the distance and the pursued trying to maintain their lead.
5. **Confrontation**: The chase culminates in a confrontation between the pursuer and the pursued, which can result in various outcomes, such as capture, escape, or a standoff",,,,"In a Chase, characters and vehicles are ranked in order of their MOV (Movement Rate). The slowest participant goes first, and the Keeper describes the situation, then each player in turn describes the actions their investigator is taking. 

Once everyone has said what they are doing, the Keeper makes a skill roll for each character, starting with the one with the lowest MOV, to determine who has moved the farthest. 

The process is then repeated until all characters have moved. Characters cannot move twice the distance of the slowest participant; the Keeper will judge each request to move on a case-by-case basis.

Harvey is fleeing from the police. His friend, Rodger, is helping him. There is a market in the way, with people 
running in all directions. Harvey requires a Dodge roll to weave through the crowd. The Keeper allows Rodger to bull his 
way through the crowd without a roll. The Keeper rolls 23 for Harvey’s Dodge; Harvey is able to weave through the crowd 
with ease.

Rodger has the highest MOV and so he leads the chase. The Keeper has no reason to increase the difficulty level; it is set 
to Regular. The Keeper rolls 84 and Harvey requires a Regular success to catch him. Harvey’s player rolls",,,,"In a chase, the fleeing character (the quarry) and the pursuing character (the pursuer) make an effort roll (CON) to establish their place in the order of movement.

During a speed roll, the object (in this case, a car) is spun around in a circular motion, usually at high speed, to simulate a sharp turn or a sudden change in direction. This is often used to:

1. Avoid obstacles: By spinning around, the object can quickly change direction and avoid hitting an obstacle, such as a tree, building, or another vehicle.
2. Pursue a target: A speed roll can be used to quickly close the distance to a pursuer, creating a sense of urgency and tension.
3. Create a dramatic effect: Speed rolls can be used to create a sense of excitement and drama, adding to the overall tension and suspense of the scene.

Speed rolls are often performed by the driver of the object, and can be done in various ways, including:

It's also used in some action movies and video games.

In a chase scenario, a speed roll is a movement technique where a person quickly rolls onto their back or side to avoid an attack or an obstacle, often while maintaining momentum and speed. This allows them to quickly change direction, evade a tackle or grab, and potentially counterattack.

To perform a speed roll, a person would:

1. Start by being in a standing or running position.
2. As they approach the obstacle or attacker, they would lower their center of gravity and bend their knees.
3. They would then quickly roll onto their back or side, using their arms to help control their movement.
4. As they roll, they would use their momentum to carry them forward, often in a different direction.
5. Once they've completed the roll, they would quickly get back to their feet or continue rolling to maintain their momentum.

The speed roll is an effective technique for evading attacks, creating distance, and regaining control in a chase scenario. It requires good timing, balance, and coordination, as well as a",,,,"In a chase, a speed roll is used to establish the order of movement. 
All participants make a skill roll: CON (for human characters) or 
the appropriate characteristic (for monsters and non-player charac-
ters); the one with the highest roll goes first, and so on. If there 
is a tie, the side with the higher DEX goes first. If still a tie, the 
characters are positioned in order of their MOV rating. Characters 
that are not in a state of movement action are not included in the 
order of movement.

G  A character can use the order of movement to their ad-
vantage by delaying their action until after their friends 
have acted. This allows them to take advantage of what-
ever is in front of them. See Delaying a Move Action

G  A character can move through a location and emerge 
in  a  different  location  as  their  movement  action

movement  action  of  8,  they  could  move  8  loca-
tions  forward  in  one  movement  action,  or",,,,"In a chase, a speed roll is used to determine the order of movement.

Those that fail to achieve a level of success are not allowed to move until their next action. 

Those that roll a Extreme level of success move twice. 

Order of movement is determined by the highest to lowest speed. 

Note:  Some  creatures  have  a  speed  that  is  not  a  listed 
value; in these cases use the creature’s MOV rating as a guide.

This is often done to quickly change direction, avoid obstacles, or evade pursuers.

In racing and drifting, a speed roll is a technique used to maintain traction and control while cornering at high speeds. It involves intentionally oversteering or understeering, causing the rear or front wheels to lose traction, and then quickly recovering by applying the correct amount of power and steering input.

In a chase scenario, a speed roll might be used by a pursued vehicle to shake off a pursuer or by a law enforcement vehicle to maintain control while pursuing a suspect. However, this is not a recommended or safe driving technique in real-life situations, as it can be hazardous and increase the risk of accidents.

In video games, a speed roll is often used as a gameplay mechanic to allow players to quickly change direction or evade obstacles while maintaining speed.",,,,"In a chase, speed rolls are used to establish the order in which participants move. 

First, all participants make a speed roll. Speed rolls are CON rolls. 

Once the speed roll is made, list the participants of the chase in speed order, fastest to slowest. 

The slowest participant should go first, as he or she will have the opportunity to make a skill roll first when the chase begins. 

If a character or vehicle is building up speed, they may make one additional movement action before their first attack or maneuver. 

Diving for cover requires a Dodge roll and a character that does so forfeits their next movement action.

Characters  and  vehicles  are  restricted  to  moving  in  a  straight 
line,  unless  they  make  a  maneuver.  A  maneuver  allows  for  a 
character or vehicle to change direction, to brake or to accelerate. 
The number of movement actions that a character or vehicle 
has is equal to its number of movement actions listed in its char-
acteristic  table  (see  page  33).  Most  characters  and  vehicles 
have  one  movement  action  by  default.  Some  have  more, ",,,,"In a chase, speed rolls are used to establish the order of 
play and to determine the number of movement actions each 
character gets to act during a round. 

A chase is made up of a string of locations. The number 
of  locations  between  each  participant  is  determined  by 
their  difference  in  MOV  speeds.  Every  10  speed  points 
of  difference  (from  fastest  to  slowest)  equals  one  loca-
tion.  If  there  is  a  gap  of  3  speed  points  between  two 
characters, the slow one is 3 locations behind and thus will 
not  appear  until  the  following  round.  The  slowest  part-
icipant will not catch the fastest until many rounds have been 
completed.

Each character gets one movement action by default. Any 
additional movement actions must be purchased with Luck points. 
Each  location  in  a  chase  requires  a  skill  roll  (either  Speed, 
Dodge,  or  the  character’s  appropriate  fighting  skill)  and  one 
movement  action.  A  character",,,
"Each participant can take one movement action per round, plus the difference between his movement rating and the movement rating of the slowest chase participant",1 or more,,,,"The number of movement actions a chase participant can make in a round is determined by their MOV rating, with each full 10 points of 
MOV adding one additional movement action. 

Every character gets at least one movement action by default. Thus, a character with a MOV of 7 gets 1 movement action, a charac-
ter with a MOV of 8 gets 2 movement actions, and so on.

In the case of a draw, the character with the higher DEX gets additional movement actions. In the case of a tie for DEX, both 
characters get the same number of movement actions.

Once the number of movement actions for each character has been determined, the characters act in DEX order, with the charac-
ter at the top of the list going first, and so on. A character’s turn in the order is not automatically their only opportunity to act in 
the round. If, on their first opportunity to act, a character has no actions to spend, the round will end and the next round will 
begin, and so on, with their turn never coming.

A character can move their speed in a straight line, and they can also use their bonus action to take a disengage or hide action, or to make a reaction. 

In addition to their movement, a character can also take a bonus action to perform certain actions, such as casting a cantrip, drawing or sheathing a weapon, or taking a disengage or hide action.",,,,"In a chase, each participant gets a number of movement actions equal to their MOV rating.

Characters with a difference of 1 MOV rate do not act in the same round. Those with a difference of 2 MOV rates will not act in the same round, nor will those with a difference of 3 MOV rates, and so on. Characters with a higher MOV rate get an additional movement action with each round that those with a lower MOV rate have already used up. 

Note: Some monsters and non-player characters may have a MOV rate that is not on the chart. In such cases, the Keeper must decide whether to round down or up; a non-player character with a MOV rate of 8 would be able to move 8 or 9 locations in one round, but would normally be limited to 8 locations, the same as a human. 

In some cases a monster may have a MOV rate that is higher than the maximum number of locations that can be moved in one round, in which case its MOV rate should be reduced to the maximum number of locations that can be moved in one round. 

When a character’s MOV",,,,"In a chase, each participant (pursuer or fleeing character) gets one movement action by default. 

Harvey is fleeing from two pursuers, Rodger and Henry. Rodger has 1 movement action and Henry has 2 (he is moving at Hard difficulty level, see 
Speed, page 138). Harvey has 4 movement actions (2 for his own MOV and 2 more because he is being pursued, see Cut to the Chase, page 
133). 

A  chase  takes  place  in  the  streets  of  London.  The  Keeper  picks  a  starting  point  and  then  decides  on  the  route  the  chase 
will  take.  The  Keeper  plots  the  route  on  a  sheet  of  graph  paper  using  a  dot  to  represent  each  location.  A  location  is 
any  point  in  the  story  that  requires  a  character  to  move  from  one  location  to  the  next,  such  as  a  room,  a  staircase,  a 
corridor, a street, and so on.

The MOV rating of a character or vehicle represents how many meters or yards they can cover with one movement action. 

On  foot,  the  standard  MOV  rating  is  8,  meaning  that  a 
character can move 8 meters with one movement action. If a character has a MOV rating of 9, for example, he or she can move 9 
meters with one movement action, and so on.

In a given round, a character or vehicle can move a number 
of yards or meters equal to its MOV rating multiplied by 10. 
Thus,  a  character  with  MOV  8  can  move  80  yards  in  one 
round. The Keeper should measure the distance in yards or me-
ters, depending on the situation. 

Once a character or vehicle has moved, it must remain where 
it is until its next turn, unless it chooses to move again. If a 
character or vehicle is in a place where it is vulnerable to attack, 
such as being on the floor or in the water, its player may choose 
to move it on a later turn,",,,,"In a chase, each participant can move a number of locations equal to their MOV rating multiplied by 2 (see Speed, page 138).",,,

game as and when they are needed to challenge the players. 
The  Keeper  should  not  pre-plan  hazards  and  obstacles 
beyond what is noted in the scenario or in the rules. Doing 
so  will  create  a  scripted  event  that  the  players  can  ap-
proach in a predictable manner, and thus be easily avoided.

er should add more hazards and obstacles as appropriate. 

Hazards and Barriers
A  barrier  blocks  progress  until  it  has  been  successfully

not block it. 

Barriers and hazards require a skill roll, the nature of the

1. **Environmental Hazards**: The Keeper can describe natural obstacles like:
	* Treacherous terrain (e.g., steep cliffs, quicksand, or raging rivers).
	* Inclement weather (e.g., storms, blizzards, or heatwaves).
	* Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, landslides, or wildfires).

	* Illusions or hallucinations to confuse or mislead the players.
3. **Creatures and Enemies**: The Keeper can introduce:
	* Hostile creatures (e.g., monsters, bandits, or wild beasts).
	* Allies or neutral entities that can aid or hinder the players (e.g., friendly NPCs, rival factions, or neutral entities like merchants or travelers).
",,,,"When  presenting  a  chase,  you  should  create  a  string  of  such 
obstacles, breaking the chase into sections, each with its own die-
roll. The distance between obstacles is always the same for everyone; 
however, some participants may spend more time covering that dis-
tance than others. The Keeper should track each character’s mov-
ment and position with respect to the hazards.

G  If  the  fleeing  character’s  speed  (MOV)  is  higher  than 
that of the pursuer,  the  pursuer  should  have  at  least  a 
chance to catch up. If the pursuer’s speed is equal to that of 
the fleeing character, the pursuer will be right behind, and 
the  Keeper  may  choose  to  start  the  chase  on  the  same 
location or perhaps 1 location behind, depending on the situ-
ation. If the pursuer’s speed is equal to or less than that of the 
fleeing character, no chase takes place, or will not take place 
for long, and the Keeper should probably fast-forward to the 
point at which the pursuer has closed the gap",,,,"Obstacles  and  hazards  are  an  essential  part  of  any  chase  and 
should  be  inserted  into  the  narrative  wherever  possible.  The 
Keeper  should  consider  the  environment  and  try  to  come 
up  with  something  appropriate  in  which  to  slow  or  block  the 
pursuer.  The  following  are  just  suggestions  and  are  offered 
as ideas rather than rules. 

Start with the obvious hazards:

Illumination: Where is the light? A dark alley could be more 
dangerous than a well-lit street, not just for what it illuminates, 
but for the feeling of safety (or danger) it inspires in the inves-
tigators. 

Stairs, steep slopes, and narrow corridors: These present the 
peril of tripping or falling. A falling investigator is prone and 
suffers 1D3 damage for each 5 feet he or she falls. A falling 
investigator must make a CON roll to avoid sustaining major 
wounds;  if  the  CON  roll  is  failed,  the  investigator  loses 
1",,,
By rolling a 1D6 to compute build damage. A delay of the vehicle can also be computed costing a 1D3 movement action,By totaling up the points of damage and comparing the result with the vehicle's build,,,,"To compute damage from a collision, compare the build of the 
impacting vehicle to the build of the vehicle that was hit. If the 
difference is one, the damage is 1D10. If the difference is two, 
the damage is 2D10. If the difference is three or more, the dam-
age is 3D10. State the damage as a range, for example “1D10 to 
2D10”. 

If  the  attacking  vehicle  is  of  a  build  that  is  equal  to  or 
below that of the target, the target is knocked off the road, and 
suffers an amount of damage equal to half the build of the other 
vehicle. This will also result in a speed roll to see if the character 
is knocked unconscious.

If  the  attacking  vehicle  is  of  a  build  that  is  2  or  more 
above that of the target, the target is destroyed in an impressive 
manner. Depending on the situation (and perhaps a Luck roll) 
this may also result in the death of all within. Those that can ex-
cape take 2 (1D3) hit points damage.",,,,By comparing the damage inflicted by the vehicle to the damage it can withstand.,,,,"Vehicle damages after a collision are typically computed using a combination of factors, including the severity of the collision, the type of vehicle, and the location of the damage. Here's a general overview of the process:

1. **Assessment of damage**: The damage is assessed by a qualified mechanic or repair technician to determine the extent of the damage. This includes evaluating the severity of the collision, the type and location of the damage, and any additional damage that may have occurred during the collision.
2. **Classification of damage**: The damage is classified into different categories, such as:
	* Minor damage: minor scratches, dents, or minor repairs that can be completed quickly and easily.
	* Moderate damage: damage that requires more extensive repairs, such as dents, scratches, or rust.
	* Major damage: damage that requires significant repairs, such as frame rust, body panel damage, or extensive bodywork.
	* Catastrophic damage: damage that is severe and requires extensive repairs, such as a total loss or significant structural damage.
3. **Cost estimation**: The cost of repairs is estimated based on the type and extent of the damage. This includes the cost of parts, labor, and any additional repairs or modifications needed.
4. **Insurance claims processing",,,,By comparing the build points lost to a vehicle's build value,,,,By totaling the build points of damage delivered.,,,,The vehicle's build is reduced by the amount of damage it takes.,,,,By totaling the build points of damage delivered.,,,,"The vehicle's build is reduced by the amount of damage taken, and any damage over the vehicle's build is taken from the vehicle's hit points.",,,,By totaling up the points of damage listed for the barrier,,,,"According to Document 2, vehicle damages are computed as follows:

- The vehicle inflicts 1D10 damage per point of build.
- Each full 10 hit points of damage decreases a vehicle's build by one point (round down).
- Any remaining damage below 10 points is ignored.
- Whenever a vehicle is used to inflict damage, it also suffers an amount of damage equal to half (round down) of that which it delivers, but never enough to cause it to lose a greater amount of build points than the target which it hit originally possessed.",,,,"Roll damage for each point of damage above 1D10, deducting 1 point of damage for each point of damage above 5",,,,"Vehicle damage computation after a collision involves a thorough assessment of the damage to determine the extent of the repairs required. Here's a step-by-step guide on how it's typically computed:

1.  **Visual Inspection**: The first step is to visually inspect the vehicle to identify the extent of the damage. This includes checking for dents, scratches, broken glass, and any other visible damage.
2.  **Damage Classification**: The damage is then classified into one of the following categories:
    *   **Minor**: Cosmetic damage that doesn't affect the vehicle's safety or functionality.
    *   **Moderate**: Damage that affects the vehicle's safety or functionality, but can be repaired without major disassembly.
    *   **Major**: Severe damage that requires significant disassembly and repair.
3.  **Estimating Repair Costs**: The next step is to estimate the cost of repairs. This involves:
    *   **Labor Costs**: Calculating the time and cost of labor required to repair the damage.
    *   **Parts Costs**: Determining the cost of replacement parts, such as body panels, glass, or mechanical components.
    *   **Specialized Labor**: If specialized labor is required, such as welding or painting, this is also factored into the",,,,"In  most  cases,  damage  to  a  vehicle  is  figured  using  the 
Fighting  skill.  The  Keeper  should  decide  whether  a  particular 
collision  constitutes  a  fighting  maneuver  or  a  hazard,  and 
thus  whether  the  vehicle  is  treated  as  a  weapon  or  as  a 
characteristic. 

When a vehicle is used as a weapon, it is treated like any other 
weapon.  The  Keeper  decides  on  the  damage  done  by  a  col-
lision.  If  the  vehicle  is  being  used  to  inflict  harm,  it  may 
also be used to fight back against those trying to attack it. A car 
or truck has a Build of 5, the same as a large human. If attacking 
with a vehicle, a character would use their Fighting skill. A being 
with a Build of 0 could be knocked to the floor by a strong wind, 
but might only be pushed or disarmed by a fellow human.

A  vehicle  can  be  used  to  make  a  fighting  maneuver",,,,"In  most  cases,  damage  to  a  vehicle  is  summarized  as  an 
amount of build that has been lost, or a specific part of the vehi-
cle is no longer operational. The Keeper should be specific as to

A  passenger  vehicle  has  a  build  of  1.  Most  vehicles  are  not 
equipped with armor plating and so do not have any additional 
armor points. A car might have a few hidden pitfalls or hazards, 
such as a loose rock or oil slick, that could cause an accident, but 
these are not typically anticipated and so do not require a Luck 
roll.

ment actions. A vehicle that makes a number of movement ac-

Here's a step-by-step overview of the process:

1. **Initial Assessment**: The first step is to assess the extent of the damage. This is usually done by the insurance adjuster or a claims adjuster, who evaluates the vehicle's condition and identifies the areas that need repair.
2. **Visual Inspection**: A thorough visual inspection is conducted to identify the type and extent of damage. This includes checking for dents, scratches, broken glass, and other visible damage.
3. **Estimate Preparation**: The adjuster or repair shop prepares an estimate of the repairs needed, including the cost of parts, labor, and any additional services required (e.g., rental car, towing).
4. **Estimate Calculation**: The estimate is calculated using industry-standard pricing guides, such as the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) guide or the Automotive Body Repair Analysis (ABRA) guide. These guides provide a standardized pricing system for parts and labor.
5. **Parts Pricing**: The cost of replacement parts is calculated based on the guide's pricing. This includes the cost of new or used parts, depending on the insurance company's policy.
6.",,,,"In 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu, vehicle damage is resolved using a comparison of the build values of the two vehicles involved in a collision. 

If the damage is less than the build of the vehicle that 
inflicted it, the vehicle takes half of the damage it inflicted 
and suffers the other half itself.

If the damage is more than the build of the vehicle that 
inflicted it, the vehicle is wrecked. It may explode, burn, roll 
or suffer some combination thereof. Those within the vehicle 
suffer an additional 1D10 damage.

A vehicle is also damaged when it is used to inflict an 
impaling or piercing injury on another vehicle or on an in-
animate object such as a tree or lamp post. The amount of 
damage is the same as for a similar attack using a natural 
weapon, such as a fist or a knife. If a vehicle is used to inflict 
damage on another vehicle, the latter must apply the “hazard”

"There are three states of insanity: temporary, indefinite and permanent.",temporary or indefinite,,,,"Indefinite Insanity. 

When an investigator loses 5 or more Sanity points as the 
result of a single Sanity roll, he or she becomes indefinitely 
insane. No investigator is simply able to shrug off this amount 
of sanity loss. A “bout of madness” has occurred (see page 
155). 

While  in  the  fragile  state  of  underlying  insanity  (after 
the initial bout of madness has passed) any further loss of San-
ity points (even a single point) will result in another bout of 
madness. This mental fragility remains for the full 1D10 hours. 
Any  further  Sanity  point  loss  during  this  time  leads  to  a 
further bout of madness, and so on. 

Once the underlying insanity has been resolved (either by 
recovery, or by the bout of madness reaching its conclusion), 
the investigator is no longer prone to further bouts of mad-
ness. Note that it is possible for a character to be in the middle 
of a bout of madness when their underlying insanity comes 
to an end; in which case the bout of madness is cut short and

2. **Drowsiness**: This state is similar to insanity, but Link's perception is slightly improved, and he can see more clearly. However, his attacks deal less damage.

4. **Confusion**: This state is the highest level of insanity, where Link's perception is severely impaired, and he becomes disoriented. His attacks deal the most damage, but he is also the most vulnerable to attacks.

Some common states of insanity in games include:

1.  **Sanity System**: This is a mechanic found in many survival horror games, such as the Amnesia series, where the player's character's sanity decreases as they experience traumatic events or witness disturbing things. When sanity drops too low, the character may experience hallucinations, become disoriented, or even lose control.

2.  **Insanity Meter**: This is a similar concept to the sanity system but is often used in other types of games, such as action-adventure or role-playing games. When the player's character's sanity meter drops, they may experience negative effects, such as reduced accuracy or increased aggression.

3.  **Madness**: In some games, the player's character may become mad or insane due to various reasons, such as witnessing traumatic events, experiencing psychological trauma, or being exposed to supernatural forces. This can lead to changes in the character's behavior, such as increased aggression or erratic decision-making.

4.  **Psychosis**: This is a state of insanity where the player's character may",,,,"In the game of Call of Cthulhu, an investigator can go insane, 
and when he or she does so, they experience a bout of madness. 
There are four states of active insanity in the game:

1.  Temporary  Insanity:  While  the  investigator  is  in  a 
state of temporary insanity, they will act irrationally. As this is 
a temporary state, the investigator will recover after a few days 
of rest and treatment.

2.  Permanent  Insanity:  While  the  investigator  is  in  a 
state of permanent insanity, they will continue to act irration-
ally. As this is a permanent state, the investigator will require 
professional treatment to recover. The player takes control of 
the investigator when they are sane.

3.  Permanent  Insanity  with  Underlying  Sanity:  When 
an  investigator  loses  more  Sanity  points  than  their  current 
Sanity score in one go (see page 156), they suffer a major in-
sanity  incident  resulting  in  permanent  insanity.  In  this  case

Firstly, there is temporary insanity, also known as ""bout of 
madness"". This lasts 1D10 hours. 

Secondly, there is a 24-hour temporary insanity. This is 
triggered when an investigator loses 5 or more Sanity points as 
a result of a single Sanity roll. 

Thirdly, there is indefinite insanity, also known as ""permanent 
madness"". This occurs when an investigator loses as much as or 
more than a characteristically maximum Sanity score in one game 
day, or when an investigator’s Sanity points fall to zero or below. 
Indefinite insanity lasts until the investigator is cured or recovers 
(see Recovery from Indefinite Insanity, page 162).

Fourthly, there is permanent insanity, which results when an 
investigator loses all Sanity points (in which case the game for that 
investigator is effectively over).

It is worth noting that the effects of temporary and indefinite 
insanity are the same: the player takes no control of the investi-
gator for the duration of the bout of madness. The difference is 
that temporary insanity lasts for 1D10 hours, whereas",,,,Two states of insanity exist in the game: temporary and indefinite.,,,,"Temporary, indefinite, and permanent insanity",,,,"Temporary insanity, and the game provides rules for both.",,,,"Indefinite insanity. 

Key: The Keeper may inflict indefinite insanity if the delu-
sional insight is terrifying, or if the investigator is clearly 
beyond  help  and  the  Keeper  wishes  to  fast  forward  the 
action and get the story back on track.

Phobia: A lasting irrational fear of something. The Keeper 
may inflict a phobia on an investigator during a bout of 
madness if appropriate to the scenario. The Keeper should 
use the generic phobia until an appropriate one has been 
chosen by the player or Keeper. The Keeper should add the 
new phobia to the investigator’s backstory. 

Mania: A lasting abnormal tendency to act in a certain way 
when  the  investigator  is  under  emotional  stress.  The 
Keeper  may  inflict  a  mania  on  an  investigator  during  a 
bout of madness if appropriate to the scenario. The Keeper 
should add the new mania to the investigator’s backstory.

Delusions  have  greater  effect  when  they  are  strongly 
linked to the investigator. A great way to do this is to have 
the delusions center on the investigator’s backstory entries.

These states can be triggered by various factors, such as encountering supernatural entities, experiencing traumatic events, or engaging in certain activities. The specific states and their effects may vary depending on the game.",,,,"In the game of Call of Cthulhu, there are four main states of 
insanity, each with its own effects and duration.

1.  Indefinite  Insanity:  While  suffering  from  this  state, 
an  investigator  is  completely  insane  and  is  out  of  play  for 
an  extended  period,  during  which  the  player  may  not  take 
control of their investigator. This state can result from being 
temporarily or permanently insane (see below), from major 
wounds, and so on. Indefinite insanity lasts until the investi-
gator has recovered (see Recovery from Insanity, page 164).

2.  Permanent Insanity: When Sanity points are reduced to 
zero the investigator is permanently and incurably insane and 
is  committed  to  an  asylum  (or  equivalent).  Any  further 
Sanity  point  loss  is  ignored  and  his  or  her  name  is  re-
moved from the investigator list. 

The only way to recover from permanent insanity is the 
intervention of an investigator with a successful Psychoanal-
ysis skill roll (see Psychoanalysis",,,,"In the game, there are three distinct states of insanity. 

First is temporary insanity, also known as a bout of madness, which lasts for 1D10 rounds (minutes). During this time the investigator acts as if under the control of their irrational personality. 

Second is indefinite insanity, also known as an insanity attack, which lasts for 1D10 hours. During this time the investigator is completely incapable of action, as if in a trance or under anesthesia. 

Third is permanent insanity, which is inflicted when the Sanity loss for a single event exceeds 5 points. 

Note: in 7th Edition and earlier, the three states of insanity were known as temporary, indefinite, and permanent; 
in  Call  of  Cthulhu  6th  Edition  and  later,  these  have  been  reworded  as  bout  of  madness,  under  the  doctor’s  care, 
and in the care of a sanitarium, respectively. 

Indefinite insanity now lasts until the character is released or until 
they have fully recovered (usually at the Keeper’s discretion, but 
this can be nominal if it is agreed that recovery will take a game 
month, or two game",,,
Five or more,1D10 Sanity points,,,,"1D10. 

When an investigator loses 1D10 Sanity points in a single day, 
they must make an Intelligence roll to avoid temporary insanity. 
If the Intelligence roll is failed, the Keeper chooses a type of 
temporary  insanity  (phobia,  mania,  or  delusion)  and  the 
investigator’s mind is lost for 1D10 hours (see Temporary 
Insanity, page 155).

Note: When in the presence of a Mythos monster, San-
ity point loss is automatic; the player cannot make a Sanity 
roll. However, if a character is in a situation in which they 
might normally make a Sanity roll (such as seeing a monster 
or  a  god),  and  they  are  distracted  (perhaps  by  a  fight-
ing maneuver), they will lose the opportunity to make the 
Sanity roll and will thus avoid insanity in that instance. 

Sanity in the Game

maximum Sanity (see Maximum Sanity, page 93). During 
play,  the  investigator’s  Sanity  will  fluctuate.  When  San-

In general, in the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, a character can become insane if they lose a certain number of Sanity points. According to the Player's Handbook (p. 146), a character can become insane if they lose 5 or more Sanity points.

However, it's worth noting that the game master (GM) can also impose additional penalties or effects on a character's Sanity score, which can make it more difficult for them to remain sane.

In some cases, a character may also become insane due to external factors, such as exposure to certain magical effects, supernatural events, or the influence of certain creatures or objects.

It's also worth noting that the concept of Sanity in D&D is a bit more nuanced than just losing points. Sanity is a measure of a character's mental state, and it can be affected by various factors, such as fear, stress, and trauma. A character can become ""unstable"" or ""broken"" if their Sanity score drops to 0, but they may still retain some level of mental function.

Losing Sanity points can lead to various effects, including temporary insanity.

According to the Call of Cthulhu rulebook, an investigator loses a point of Sanity when they experience a traumatic event or witness something horrific. The exact number of points lost can vary depending on the specific event and the investigator's individual characteristics.

Temporary insanity typically occurs when an investigator loses 1-5 points of Sanity. When an investigator loses 1-2 points, they may experience minor effects such as confusion, disorientation, or a temporary loss of memory. Losing 3-5 points can lead to more severe effects, such as hallucinations, paranoia, or a complete breakdown of their mental state.

However, the exact number of points required to become temporarily insane can vary depending on the specific situation and the game master's discretion.",,,,"An investigator must lose 5 or more Sanity points in one day, or a cumulative total of 1D10 Sanity points in any 24-hour period, to become temporarily insane.",,,,"An investigator must lose 5 or more Sanity points without any

lost 5 or more Sanity points as a result of a single Sanity roll 
is  permanently  insane.  Note  that  the  loss  of  1D10  Sanity 
points or more in one day also leads to permanent insanity.

While  the  investigator  is  temporarily  insane  (which  is 
each hour that the investigator is insane), the player must make 
an Intelligence roll at the end of each hour of game time. If the 
player fails the roll, the investigator remains insane for another 
hour.  If  the  player  succeeds  in  the  Intelligence  roll,  the 
investigator is no longer insane and the player can make a San-
ity roll to see if their investigator loses additional Sanity points as 
a result of their bout of madness.

Call of CthulhuPhobia: A lasting irrational fear of something. The investigator 
sees the phobia-inducing thing and immediately begins to 
sicken (roll CON roll, 1/1D10 SAN loss) and has a dream or 
vision (roll 1/1D10 SAN loss) on the following day. There-
after the investigator loses 1D3 Sanity points each day until 
either the phobia has taken full effect or the investigator has 
gone insane. 

Mania: A lasting abnormal tendency or obsession. The inves-
tigator begins to crave the thing they are obsessed with and 
seeks  it  constantly,  even  if  it  means  risking  great  danger 
or  repulsion  to  others.  This  may  be  emotional  (phobia)  or 
physical (mania).

Losing Sanity points can lead to temporary insanity, which can have various effects on the investigator's abilities and interactions with the game world.

In Arkham Horror, an investigator starts with 0 Sanity points. They can gain Sanity points by resolving certain events or using specific items, but they can also lose Sanity points by encountering terrifying events, investigating mysteries, or experiencing other traumatic events.

The exact number of Sanity points an investigator must lose to become temporarily insane varies depending on the specific game scenario or house rule being used. However, in the standard Arkham Horror rules, an investigator typically becomes temporarily insane when their Sanity points drop to 0.

When an investigator's Sanity points reach 0, they become temporarily insane, which can lead to various effects, such as:

1.  The investigator must discard a skill token.
2.  The investigator is unable to perform certain actions or use specific skills.
3.  The investigator may experience other penalties or effects, depending on the specific game scenario.

It's worth noting that some investigators may have a higher or lower Sanity threshold for becoming temporarily insane, depending on their unique abilities or traits. Additionally, some game scenarios or expansions may introduce new mechanics",,,,"An investigator would lose 5 Sanity points in a single day to become temporary insane. Alternatively, if the cumulative loss of Sanity points reaches one-fifth of the investigator’s maximum Sanity, the investigator becomes temporary insane (see page 154 of the 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu rulebook).",,,,"6 points of Sanity loss results in temporary insanity. 

If the Sanity loss is between 17 and 30 points, the investigator is indefinitely insane.

If the Sanity loss is 31 points or more, the investigator is permanently insane. 

In each case, the Keeper should describe the onset of insanity as a turning point in the story, marking a significant event in the investigator’s 
life. A bout of madness should come to an end, the investigator emerging somewhat changed, at a point that seems appropriate to the 
Keeper, but at least 1D10 hours after it began. The Keeper may call for a Sanity roll to test the investigator’s Sanity points after recover-
ing from insanity. If the roll fails, the investigator has lost further Sanity points as a result of the bout of madness. The Keeper may add 
other sanctions as a result of the bout of madness, in common with those for permanent insanity (at the Keeper’s discretion).

Call of CthulhuTable",,,,The Keeper decides how many hours temporary insanity lasts.,,,,"The concept of temporary insanity is a complex and nuanced topic, and the duration of its effects can vary significantly from person to person. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, as it depends on various factors, including the severity of the injury or condition, the individual's mental state at the time, and the specific circumstances surrounding the incident.

In general, temporary insanity is typically defined as a state of mind that is characterized by a lack of control over one's actions, a distorted perception of reality, and a diminished capacity for rational thought. The duration of temporary insanity can be measured in different ways, including:

1. **Duration of symptoms**: The length of time during which a person experiences symptoms of temporary insanity, such as confusion, disorientation, or impaired judgment.
2. **Duration of the incident**: The length of time during which the incident occurred, which can impact the severity of the injury or condition.
3. **Severity of the injury or condition**: The severity of the injury or condition that caused the incident, which can affect the duration of temporary insanity.
4. **Individual factors**: The individual's mental state, personality, and coping mechanisms at the time of the incident can also influence the duration of temporary insanity.

The duration of temporary insanity is not strictly defined and can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case.

In the United States, the Model Penal Code, which is a widely adopted set of model laws for states, defines temporary insanity as a condition that lasts for a short period of time, typically a few minutes or hours, and is caused by a sudden and intense emotional or psychological stimulus.

In practice, the duration of temporary insanity is often determined by the court on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific facts and circumstances of the case. The court may consider factors such as:

1. The nature and severity of the mental disorder or defect
2. The duration and intensity of the stimulus that triggered the disorder
3. The defendant's ability to control their actions during the period of insanity
4. The defendant's prior mental health history and any previous episodes of insanity

In general, temporary insanity is typically considered to last for a short period of time, such as:

* A few minutes or hours, as",,,,"In Call of Cthulhu, the duration of temporary insanity is deter-
mined by rolling on Table 8: Bouts of Madness—Summary, 
or  by  rolling  1D10  hours  and  rounding  up,  see  Temporary 
Insanity (page 124). 

In some instances, the Keeper may choose to roll 1D10 and 
multiply the result by 10 to get a number of hours (see Rethinking 
a Situation, page 162).

It is advised that the Keeper does not use time in this way as 
a  punishment.  Instead  the  Keeper  should  try  to  incorporate 
the  negative  consequence  of  a  failed  Pushed  roll  within  the 
story and make it relevant to the non-player character. For exam-
ple,  if  the  goal  were  to  persuade  a  police  officer,  a  failed 
Pushed roll could result in the officer becoming belligerent and 
arresting the investigator for obstructing a police officer in the 
performance of his duty—something that will only serve to add 
to the investigator’s troubles later on.

Failed Dice Rolls and S",,,,"In Call of Cthulhu,  the  duration  of  temporary  insanity  is 
determined  by  rolling  on  Table  VIII:  Duration  of  Insanity,

unit of time, depending on the circumstances of the bout of 
madness.

of  how  time  passes  during  the  bout  of  madness.  If  days 
are chosen, the Keeper should have a good idea of how long 
the bout of madness will last. 

If  the  Keeper  knows  that  the  bout  of  madness  will  be 
limited to a short period, such as until the character is out of 
sight of the thing they are trying to flee from, then the bout of 
madness should be set to only a few hours or rounds. If the

The Keeper may choose to have a random chance of success 
with a 1D100 roll to determine if the investigator’s bout of 
madness is real or imaginary (see Reality Check, page 162). 
Whether  real  or  imaginary,  the  bout  of  madness  takes  the 
same amount of real-world time (1D10 hours).

If the investigator is alone, he or she may be treated by 
a doctor or by a successful Medicine roll. In the case of a 
failing roll, the Keeper may inflict a bout of madness.

Treatment with private home care (at the Keeper’s dis-
cretion) or in some friendly place (of the player’s choice) 
may  be  attempted  by  a  non-player  character  or  another 
investigator. This is a skill roll; if successful, the investigator 
recovers 1 Sanity point per day (see page 154).

The duration of temporary insanity is not strictly defined and can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case.

In the United States, the Model Penal Code, which is a widely adopted code that provides a framework for criminal law, defines the insanity defense as follows:

""A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of a mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.""

The duration of temporary insanity is not explicitly stated in the Model Penal Code, but courts have developed various standards to determine when a defendant's mental state was sufficiently impaired to justify an insanity defense.

Some factors that courts consider when determining the duration of temporary insanity include:

1. **The nature and severity of the mental disorder**: The more severe the disorder, the longer the duration of temporary insanity may be considered.
2. **The defendant's behavior and actions**: If the defendant's behavior was consistent with a mental disorder,",,,,"In Call of Cthulhu, the duration of temporary insanity is 
determined by the player. When going insane, the player 
chooses one, two, or three (rolling 1D3) hours of real time

Alternatively,  the  Keeper  may  decide  on  the  duration 
of  insanity  if  time  is  important  in  the  developing  plot,

more  than  one-fifth  of  the  caster’s  current  Sanity  points, 
the caster’s mind is overwhelmed and the temporary insanity 
lasts for 1D10 hours. The effects of the spell or encounter 
with the entity are still present at the end of this period or

Note that this is an average; as Keeper you have the freedom to adjust the rate of aging as you wish. 

When a character ages 99 points to become an old character (or if age is reduced to zero), the Keeper should consider how to mod-

to recover. The player may also make a Sanity roll at the end 
of each month, with the goal “to recover their composure.” 
The player wins the Sanity roll and the investigator recovers 
from indefinite insanity. 

Second, the Keeper can call for a Sanity roll with the goal 
“to face their fears.” The Keeper picks one of the investiga-
tor’s phobias or manias, and the player must make a Sanity 
roll. If the roll is successful, the investigator loses the phobia or 
mania. If the roll is unsuccessful, the investigator loses 1D6 
Sanity points. If the Sanity roll is fumbled, the investigator 
loses 2D6 Sanity points and begins a bout of madness. The

It sounds like you're going through a very tough time. Recovering from indefinite insanity can be a complex and individualized process, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. However, I can offer some general guidance and resources that might help.

**Please note that if you're experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, I strongly encourage you to seek help from a qualified mental health professional or a crisis hotline. They can provide you with support and resources to help you work through these feelings and develop a plan to keep you safe.**

That being said, here are some general steps that might be helpful:

It's possible that it's a fictional or made-up term, or it may be a misunderstanding or misremembering of a real condition.

However, I can provide information on some common mental health conditions that may be related to the term ""insanity"" or that may cause similar symptoms. If you're experiencing symptoms that concern you, I recommend consulting a mental health professional for proper evaluation and guidance.

Some possible conditions that may be related to the term ""insanity"" include:

1.  **Psychosis**: A condition characterized by a disconnection from reality, often involving hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.
2.  **Schizophrenia**: A chronic mental health disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, often causing hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.
3.  **Bipolar disorder**: A mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings, from manic highs to depressive lows.
4.  **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**: A condition that can develop after experiencing a traumatic event, causing symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and anxiety.

If you're experiencing symptoms that concern you, here are some general tips for recovering",,,,"Recovery from indefinite insanity can take a while. 

Indefinite insanity lasts until the investigator is cured or recovers. 
The duration of indefinite insanity is left up to the Keeper. It can 
be a few days, a month, or even years. 

The only way to end indefinite insanity is with successful Intellect 
( INT ) rolls. The player makes a roll and if they fail, they make 
another roll and so on. The Keeper may set a maximum number 
of rolls that may be attempted. A variation is to require that the 
player roll equal to or below half their INT. 

Alternatively,  the  Keeper  could  allow  a  combined  dice 

roll, with the player rolling a percentile dice and the Keeper rolling 
a 1D100 alongside them. If the player wins the roll, the investigator 
recovers from their insanity. If the Keeper wins, the bout of madness 
continues.

A  bout  of  madness  ends  when  the  investigator  either  recovers 
(see below) or is persuaded to act rationally by another character. 
A  bout  of  madness  will  always  take  at  least  one  combat 
round, but may",,,,"In Call of Cthulhu,  indefinite  insanity  is  a  potentially  dire  con-
dition for an investigator, and getting an investigator back on his or 
her feet can take time. 

Recovery from indefinite insanity requires a Sanity roll. An in-
vestigator  recovers  from  indefinite  insanity  when  he  or  she  is 
found to have fully returned to their senses and their behavior is 
no longer disordered. This takes 1D10 days. During this time 
the player must make a Sanity roll at the end of each week of in-
definite insanity. If the Sanity roll is failed, the investigator falls 
back into a state of madness and the process starts over. If the 
Sanity  roll  is  successful,  the  investigator  has  recovered  and 
returns to the game as normal.

Alternatively,  at  the  Keeper’s  discretion,  recovery  can  be 
accelerated  if  the  investigator  is  successfully  treated  by  a  doc-
tor.  This  may  be  especially  true  in  a  hospital  or  sanitarium.  The 
Keeper may lower the Sanity",,,,By undergoing a successful Reality Check roll (see page 162),,,,A successful Sanity roll,,,,A successful Psychoanalysis roll by a qualified psychiatrist.,,,,"The best way to recover from Indefinite Insanity is to have

Call of CthulhuRecovery from indefinite insanity takes time and is different 
for each investigator. The Keeper should judge the duration 
of  insanity  and  recovery  roll  should  be  made  at  the  end  of 
each month of game time that elapses since the investigator 
was last in a state of mind to make a dice roll. Recovery from 
permanent insanity is unlikely; the Keeper should test for it 
with a Per 5% roll at the end of each month.

The Keeper should test for indefinite insanity once during 
each month of game time (more often if the investigator is in 
a place of safety). The Keeper should test for indefinite insanity 
in one of two ways (rolling 1D100, with results of 96–100 being 
a success):

cruited a new phobia or mania), the Keeper should test 
for indefinite insanity.

The Keeper may also allow automatic recovery during the next Investigator Development Phase.",,,,"I'm assuming you're referring to the concept of ""indefinite insanity"" as a plot device or a fictional condition, rather than a real medical or psychological condition. In that case, I'll provide a hypothetical response.

If we're talking about a fictional scenario where a character or individual is experiencing ""indefinite insanity,"" it's essential to note that this is not a real condition and should not be taken as medical advice.

That being said, if we're looking at a narrative or fictional context, here are some general steps that might help a character recover from such a condition:

1.  **Seek professional help**: In a fictional context, the character might benefit from seeking help from a therapist, counselor, or a trusted authority figure who can provide guidance and support.
2.  **Grounding techniques**: The character might use grounding techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or physical activities like walking or yoga, to help them focus on the present moment and calm their mind.
3.  **Social support**: Surrounding themselves with loved ones, friends, or a support group can provide emotional support and help the character feel less isolated.
4.  **Self-care**: Engaging in activities that bring joy and relaxation, such as hobbies, reading, or creative",,,,"Recovery from indefinite insanity can take a while. 

Recovery from temporary indefinite insanity can happen in one of two ways.

First, the player can choose to have their investigator make 

an Intelligence (INT) roll to regain full mental capacity.

Second,  any  non-player  characters  or  other  players’ 
investigator  helpers  can  make  a  Sanity  roll  to  help  their 
comrade recover. If the Sanity roll is successful, the investigator 
immediately recovers from their insanity. 

If the roll is unsuccessful, the process of recovery begins. 
The  investigator  is  then  treated  as  a  new  patient  and  the 
process of treatment begins anew. This may involve a return to 
the asylum, in which case the player will have to make further 
Sanity rolls for the duration of the investigator’s stay. Alterna-
tively, the investigator might be treated successfully in private, 
in which case the recovery phase is over and the game can pro-
ceed with the player’s next investigator development phase.

Treatment with private institutions and by private practitioners 
may be lacking in some respect, but it is generally available 
and effective enough to justify the use of the “",,,,"In Call of Cthulhu, recovery from indefinite insanity takes time and 
care, and three different paths are available to the investigator—private 
care, institutionalization, and self-help. 

Private Care
The best care available is at home or in some friendly place where 
personal attention can be given. This may be the home of a rela-
tive or friend, or even a sanitarium with a private ward. The 
investigator’s living standards determine the standard of such 
places. For the next 1D4 hours (or as the Keeper judges fit) the 
investigator is under the care of doctors and nurses, and has 
no need to make any rolls for food and lodging. 

The  care  provider  makes  a  dice  roll  for  Sanity  point 
recovery  as  per  the  Medic  skill  (if  a  nurse  or  doctor),  or 
Psychology (if a close friend or relative), or Intimacy (if a loved 
one), or Charm (if a sex worker). If the roll fails, the investiga-
tor gains no benefit. If the roll succeeds, the investigator gains 1D3

another character, or by gaining the knowledge through an experience.

Learning a Spell from a Book
To learn a spell from a book, the investigator must first find 
a copy of the book that contains the spell. The book must be 
a  suitable  tome  for  the  spell;  the  Keeper  must  decide  on 
this case by case. A spell is likely to be found in a tome that 
is of a similar or higher Magic point cost. A tome that is of 
greater Magic point cost can never be used to learn a spell 
that requires a casting roll, as the tomes are not capable of 
withstanding the magical energies involved.

Learning a Spell from Another Person
A  character  may  learn  a  spell  from  another  character.  If 
the teacher is willing, the process is relatively quick, taking 
only a few hours in the case of a simple spell. The student 
must make a successful Idea roll to learn the spell. If the roll 
is failed, the student may try again, although the process will 
take longer",,,,"A character can learn a spell from a book, a teacher, or by reading a tome.",,,,"In various fictional settings, characters can learn spells through different methods. Here are some common ways a character might learn a spell:

1. **Apprenticeship**: In some magical traditions, a character may learn a spell by apprenticing with an experienced mage or wizard. This involves learning the spell from a master and practicing it under their guidance.
2. **Study and research**: Characters might study ancient tomes, scrolls, or other written texts to learn about the spell and its history, theory, and application. They may also research the materials needed to cast the spell, such as ingredients, rituals, or magical tools.
3. **Trial and error**: Some characters might learn a spell by experimenting and trial-and-error, testing the spell in a controlled environment, such as a laboratory or a magical trial ground.
4. **Mentorship**: A character might learn a spell from a wise and experienced mentor, who teaches them the spell and shares their knowledge and experience.
5. **Incantation and visualization**: Characters might learn a spell by focusing their mind and using visualization techniques to connect with the magical energy and channel it into the spell.

2.  **Apprenticeship**: Finding a powerful wizard or sorcerer who takes them under their wing and teaches them the art of magic. This can be a one-on-one mentorship, where the apprentice learns from their master's experiences and techniques.
3.  **Self-Study**: Through intense research and experimentation, a character might discover and learn a spell on their own. This can involve pouring over ancient tomes, practicing spells in secret, and experimenting with magical energies.
4.  **Trial and Error**: A character might stumble upon a spell by accident, and then learn to control and refine it through trial and error. This can be a more organic and unpredictable way of learning, where the character discovers the spell's limitations and potential dangers.

various  and  mysterious  process.  Here  are  a  few  ideas 
to get you started. 

Finding a Copy of the Book
An  occult  tome  is  the  primary  source  for  learning  a 
spell. Each tome is different, and the information in here is 
meant to be a starting point for the Keeper to draw from. A 
tome might list a spell’s name, a general description of what 
the spell does, an estimate of the casting time, the number 
of magic points needed, and any special ingredients or por-
tions needed. A tome might also note any special conditions 
that must be met for the spell to succeed.

A spell can be found in only one place in a tome, though 
the same information can be pieced together from several 
different sources. The Keeper can dictate which spells can be 
found in which tomes, though consistency is not required. 
The  Keeper  should  not  feel  compelled  to  include  any 
specific spells in any of the books, although the Keeper’s 
library should have at least one copy of each Mythos tome 
",,,,"In  the  game,  learning  a  spell  is  a  variable  and  poten-
tially hazardous process. Spells are not something to be picked 
up quickly, and usually require dedication and attention from 
the caster. A player seeks to know the cost and effect of a spell, 
including the magic points, Sanity points, and Sanity loss, as 
well as any other relevant information.

There are three methods of learning a spell.

G  From a book.

G  From another person (by direct contact).

G  From a Mythos entity.

Learning a Spell from a Book
A  book  of  spells  is  a  Mythos  tome.  Each  tome  is  dif-
ferent, with a unique set of spells and information. The user 
of a tome must spend time reading it, usually 2D6 weeks, 
and  the  book  must  be  open  and  the  reader  fully  focused 
upon it. While the investigator is learning a spell from a book, 
the  book  may  be  referenced  for  other  spells  or  information 
thereafter without additional time being required.

3. One-on-one teaching by a powerful sorcerer or cultist (implied in Document 1, as they have larger pools of Magic points).",,,,"In the realm of fantasy and fiction, learning a spell can be a fascinating and complex process. Here's a general outline of how a character might learn a spell:

1.  **Discovery**: The character may stumble upon an ancient tome, a mysterious artifact, or a wise mentor who teaches them about the spell. This can be a magical text, a cryptic message, or a hidden knowledge passed down through generations.
2.  **Understanding the basics**: The character must comprehend the fundamental principles of magic, such as the elements, energies, and forces involved. This might involve studying the properties of magic, its limitations, and the risks associated with its use.
3.  **Gathering ingredients and materials**: Depending on the spell, the character may need to collect specific ingredients, such as rare herbs, gemstones, or magical components. These items can be found in various locations, like enchanted forests, ancient ruins, or hidden caves.
4.  **Practicing and experimenting**: The character will likely need to practice the spell repeatedly, experimenting with different techniques, incantations, and gestures. This process can be time-consuming and may involve trial and error, as the character learns to control the spell's effects.
5.  **Mentorship and guidance",,,,"In the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, learning a spell can occur in three main ways: 

Reading a Mythos book.

Learning from another person (either a fellow investigator or 
somebody a little too familiar with the Cthulhu Mythos).

Through personal experience (usually encountering a Mythos 
entity or being exposed to Mythos energy).

The investigator is the player’s portal to the world of the game. 
Everything in the game is experienced through the investiga-
tor. The truth is known through the investigator. When some-
one  says  something  the  player  wishes  to  know,  they  should 
ask the question “What?” rather than “Do you know?” Players 
should avoid asking for dice rolls unless their investigators have 
actually  encountered  the  thing  they  wish  to  fight,  as  the 
advice in this chapter is aimed at providing Keepers with advice 
on how to run such encounters. 

Winning the Idea Roll
The Keeper has more freedom to alter the outcome of an idea 
roll than he or she does with a skill roll. If the players have 
identified a clue, they have done their job; it is now up to the 
Keeper",,,,"In the Cthulhu Mythos, knowledge of the gods is gained 
through pain, fear, and a willingness to give up your mind 
and soul to the unknowable. 

Finding a tome is only the first step; the owner must also 
learn to tap into the knowledge it contains. This is the func-
tion of the study phase. The study roll is the most important 
roll for spell-crafters and occult scholars, as it determines 
whether the character gains the knowledge contained within a 
tome.

To  study  a  Mythos  tome,  the  investigator  spends  a 
number of hours equal to or less than the book’s POW rating 
perusing the text. The reader must make a Sanity roll (0/1) 
after  each  month  of  study  (see  Self-help  in  the  Skills 
chapter),  and  also  after  every  12  hours  of  actual  reading. 
If  the  reader  is  successful,  he  or  she  may  continue  study 
without interruption. A failed roll indicates that the investi-
gator has not absorbed the information and they must continue 
their study (rolling immediately",,,
A Hard POW roll,An opposed INT roll to the target.,,,,"A player must make a Sanity roll to learn a spell. If the Sanity 
roll is successful, a successful INT roll will allow the investigator 
to  cast  the  spell.  A  character  can  learn  to  cast  a  spell  in 
one session, but it will be some time before they can cast it—
the Keeper determines the interval.

A Hard INT roll is required to begin to learn a spell. If this 
roll is failed, the investigator has not understood the spell and 
no progress has been made. The player may make another at-
tempt to learn the spell at the next session, or on any other oc-
casion when the player wishes to push the roll. The player may 
make one, and only one, attempt to learn a spell in a single 
game session.

The player describes to the Keeper how their investigator 
is trying to learn the spell. The Keeper may require the inves-
tigator to purchase a tome in which the spell is inscribed or 
written down. The Keeper may decide that the investigator 
must find a teacher, or that the investigator must perform 
a certain task in order to learn the spell.

The player then makes a reading roll for the book (if using",,,,A magic roll,,,,"In the context of Dungeons & Dragons, a spellcaster must make a Wisdom (spell save) check to cast a spell.",,,,A magic roll,,,,"An opposed roll, with the goal to roll under the investigator’s POW.",,,,A skill roll,,,,"An opposed roll, with the goal to roll under the investigator’s POW.",,,,An opposed POW roll,,,,An opposed POW roll with the target,,,,A Hard POW roll is required to successfully cast a spell for the first time.,,,,An opposed POW roll,,,,"In many tabletop role-playing games, particularly those based on fantasy settings, a player typically needs to roll a specific type of dice to cast a spell. The most common type of roll is a D20 (a 20-sided die).

When casting a spell, the player usually rolls a D20 and adds a relevant ability score modifier, skill level, or other relevant bonuses to the roll. The total result is then compared to a Difficulty Class (DC) set by the game master or the spell's description. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the spell is successful, and the desired effect occurs.

However, the specific type of roll and the rules surrounding spellcasting can vary depending on the game system being used, such as Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, or other tabletop RPGs.",,,,"In roleplaying games, to cast a spell the player must make a 
Sanity roll (if the spell costs Sanity points) and also a roll for 
the skill used by the spell. If the spell costs magic points it may 
not be cast if the caster is out of magic points. Some spells have 
other prerequisites, such as the need for a piece of enchanted 
wax, a vial of space-mead, and so on. 

Whether a character is able to cast a particular spell is also 
determined by his or her Cthulhu Mythos skill (see page 63).

Cthulhu  Mythos  encompasses.  Spells  are  presented  in 
this  book  in  a  number  of  categories,  including  Call  and 
Contact Spells, Creation Spells, Enchantment Spells, Gate 
Spells,  Power  Spells,  and  Summoning  Spells.  Spells  may 
also be grouped according to theme in some Mythos scenarios, 
such as spells for contacting the dead or for causing harm to 
enemies. 

Spells are divided into two groups: Cthulhu Mythos",,,,"In most cases, to cast a spell, a player must make an opposed 
POW (Power) roll. This is opposed by the POW of the target of 
the spell (if any) or the local ""ambient"" POW (for spells cast at a 
remote location or in a supposedly ""haunted"" area). 

The  player  should  state  what  the  investigator  is  trying 
to achieve with the spell. The Keeper then tells if it is possible 
and, if so, asks for a POW roll. If the roll is a success, the spell 
works as described in the rules. A failed roll means that noth-
ing happens. A fumble has some special consequences (usually 
bad ones). 

The Keeper should never tell a player that he or she has won 
a roll until the story has been developed a little. Avoid saying, 
“Yes, you were able to push the door open”, instead say “The 
door creaked and splintered as it swung open”. The latter in-
cludes a consequence (the door is damaged) that is in addition 
to the player winning the roll. 

When a player loses a pushed roll, you have a blank slate. 
The situation is as",,,,An opposed INT roll,,,,A dice roll,,,,A dice roll,,,,"A skill roll (usually an opposed roll with a non-player

Call of CthulhuThe Keeper may choose to grant automatic success to a 
spell if the conditions for casting it are exceptionally 
good; for example, casting a spell at the dark of the moon 
on  a  clear  night  with  the  stars  Aldebaran  and  Fomal-
haut  visible  in  the  sky  in  the  southern  hemisphere  in 
March  or  September.  The  Keeper  should  consider  the 
spell cost and add or amend the casting time before setting 
the increased POW cost. The increased cost should have a 
greater effect than that of the spell. The Keeper should also 
consider the increased cost in Magic points and Sanity points 
and amend these as appropriate.

The  Keeper  should  consider  the  situation  and  then 
determine  the  likely  location  of  the  spell’s  effect  and  the 
amount of Magic points and Sanity points required. The Keeper 
should  also  decide  on  any  additional ",,,,A 1D100 roll,,,,An opposed POW roll,,,,An opposed POW roll,,,,A Hard POW roll is required to successfully cast a spell the first time (Document 1).,,,,"In many tabletop role-playing games, particularly in the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) series, a player typically needs to perform a specific action to cast a spell. The most common actions associated with casting a spell are:

1. **Rolling an Intelligence check**: In D&D 5th edition, players usually roll an Intelligence check to cast a spell. This is because Intelligence is the ability score associated with magical knowledge and spellcasting.
2. **Rolling a Spell Attack**: If the spell requires an attack roll, the player rolls a d20 (a 20-sided die) and adds their spellcasting ability modifier (usually Intelligence or Wisdom) to the roll. The target's Armor Class (AC) is then compared to the result.
3. **Rolling a Dexterity check**: In some cases, a Dexterity check might be required, especially for spells that involve physical actions like casting a spell while moving or in a specific environment.

However, the specific action required to cast a spell can vary depending on the game system, the type of spell, and the game master's discretion.",,,,"In most cases, to cast a spell the player must make a successful POW roll.",,,,"In most cases, to cast a spell the player must make a 
Sanity roll (if the spell requires a Sanity point payment) or 
a  POW  roll  (if  it  does  not).  Additional  requirements 
may be set by the Keeper; for example, a roll may be required 
on the cultist’s INT or EDU. 

The  player  should  be  provided  with  a  description 
of the spell’s effect from the spell description. However, the 
actual damage, Sanity loss, or other outcome is determined 
using the rules for spells and magic in the game. 

The  caster  also  rolls  dice  to  determine  the  number 
of  magic  points  expended  and  the  number  of  Sanity 
points  sacrificed,  as  noted  on  the  chart  for  that  parti-
cular spell. The Keeper should emphasize that the caster is 
essentially  sacrificing  Sanity  points  and  magic  points, 
and  that  the  spell  will  not  work  if  sufficient  magic points 
and Sanity points are not expended. 

The Keeper should take care to describe the spell’s effect

effect of the spell.

T  The caster suffers the full effect of the spell (this can in-
clude Sanity loss, physical harm, and so on).

by the spell itself).

maximum,  the  excess  is  lost  as  magical  energy  that  is 
channeled to the god. The caster must then make a CON 
roll or collapse. The caster also loses 1D3 Sanity points.

1. **Miss**: If a spellcaster fails to meet the spell's casting requirements, they may miss the spell. This can be due to various factors, such as lack of concentration, insufficient magical energy, or a critical failure in the spell's casting mechanics.
2. **Missed spell**: If a spell is cast but fails to hit the target, it may not deal any damage or have any effect. The spell may also be considered a ""miss"" or a ""fizzle.""
3. **Missed spell damage**: If a spell is cast and fails to hit the target, the spell's damage may not be applied. This can be a significant setback for the caster, especially if the spell is a critical attack or a critical hit.
4. **Missed spell effect**: Some spells may have an effect that is not triggered if the spell is cast but fails to hit the target. For example, a spell that deals damage to a specific location may not affect the target if the spell is cast but fails to hit.

Additionally, the Keeper may add one or more side effects for less powerful spells (Document 1), and for more powerful spells, the side effects can be worse (Document 1).

2.  **Spell Backfires**: The spell has an unintended effect, often opposite of its intended purpose. For example, a fireball spell might create a small, harmless flame instead of a large explosion.

must immediately pay the full Magic point cost of the spell. No 
such payment is required if the roll is a regular success.

When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  pushed  and  the  roll  is  still 
failed, the caster should consider the consequences for the failed 
casting roll (see The Consequences of Failing a Pushed Spell 
Casting Roll, page 180). No Magic points are spent or San-
ity lost if the pushed roll is failed.

When  a  spell  is  recast  as  a  pushed  casting  (while  the 
original casting is still in effect) the Keeper must apply the con-
sequences of the pushed casting roll to the current spell effect. In 
other words, the pushed casting roll is not for the benefit of the 
caster but for the benefit of the players. It gives the players an 
opportunity to alter or negate the current spell effect.

make a skill roll to resist the spell, which may not always be 
appropriate",,,,"When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  failed,  refer  to  the  Keeper

esting outcome.

roll. No Sanity points are lost and no magic points are spent.
T  The spell has a partial effect. The Keeper may choose to 
have part (but not all) of the spell’s effect take place. For 
example, in the case of a Create Zombie spell, the corpse 
comes to life but does not act like a normal zombie. Per-
haps it is friendly and docile? Picking a random selection 
of characteristics might create an unusual zombie. 

T  The spell causes a fumble. A fumble always leads to the 
opposite of the intended effect (see The Omen Roll, page

use 1D3 magic points to stabilize the wound. The victim will 
die if hit point total goes to zero.

Additionally, the Keeper may add one or more side effects for less powerful spells (choose or roll 1D8), which can affect the caster and others nearby (Document 1). For more powerful spells, the side effects can be worse.",,,,"In the context of tabletop role-playing games, particularly those that involve magic, a spell casting roll can fail in several ways. The specific consequences of a failed spell casting roll can vary depending on the game system being used, but here are some common outcomes:

1. **Spell Fails to Cast**: The spell may not be cast at all, or it may be cast in a weakened or altered form. This could result in the spell having little to no effect, or it could have an unintended consequence.
2. **Spell Backfires**: The spell could have an opposite or unintended effect, often with chaotic or humorous results. For example, a spell meant to heal might instead cause harm.
3. **Spell Misfires**: The spell might not affect the intended target, but instead affects the caster or others nearby. This could result in the caster or others taking damage or suffering an unintended consequence.
4. **Spell Fails to Resolve**: The spell's effects may not be resolved immediately, but instead, the spell's outcome is delayed or becomes a pending effect that will be resolved later.
5. **Spell's Effects are Reduced**: The spell's effects are diminished or reduced in some way, such as a weaker damage output or a shorter duration.
6. **Spell's Effects",,,,"When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  pushed  and  failed,  the  caster 
should  consider  themselves  fortunate  if  they  are  no  more 
than 5 miles away from the target when the spell fails. If this was 
a spell which affected an individual, the target is harmed rather 
than benefited by the spell. The Keeper should determine the nature 
of  the  harm  (physical  injury,  sanity  loss,  madness,  etc.)  and 
amount (rolling 1D6 and dividing by 10, rounding down, and then 
multiplying by 5). The Keeper should describe some manner in 
which  the  caster  has  somehow  corrupted  or  perverted  the 
original spell. Alternatively, the Keeper may choose a spell which 
is very similar to the one that was cast, but with a significant 
difference (a ‘corrupted version’).

If the roll is fumbled, the caster and any other participants 
suffer 1D10 damage each from the sudden, uncontrolled out-
burst of magical energy. Everyone within 10 yards takes 1D10 
damage and everyone within 30 yards takes 1D3",,,,"When  a  spell  casting  roll  is  failed,  refer  to  the  Keeper’s 
notebook for the specific spell for what happens next. In general, 
one of the following occurs.

T  The spell does nothing.

T  The spell causes a fumble result (the opposite of the spell’s 
intended effect).

T  The spell causes a random result (the Keeper decides on a 
random effect, possibly related to the theme of the spell, 
and possibly worse than a fumble).

T  The spell causes a fumble result, but rather than the spell 
backfiring, the magic points spent are lost and no effect is 
produced.

If  the  caster  suffers  a  fumble  on  casting  a  spell  that 
involves the loss of hit points (such as Drain Magic Points, 
Wither Limb, or Cause Wound), the Keeper should choose a 
more severe effect. The Keeper can either use the fumble result 
as it stands or roll again and fumble again, using the second 
fumble result. 

The Keeper is now using a custom rule. The Keeper’s 
decision is final.

Here are some of the things the Keeper might advise the players on:

2. **Setting and world**: The Keeper provides information about the campaign setting, including its history, geography, and notable locations, which can help the players understand the context of their adventure.

1. **Setting**: The game is set in the 1920s, a time of great change and upheaval. The world is on the brink of a new era, but there are still remnants of the old world that are not yet fully understood.
2. **Tone**: The game is a horror game, and the Keeper will be presenting the players with dark, unsettling, and often terrifying situations. Players should be prepared for a challenging and intense experience.
3. **Investigator Background**: Each investigator has a unique background, skills, and abilities. Players should choose a background that fits their character concept and playstyle.
4. **Attributes**: The game uses a six-point attribute system, with six attributes: POW (Power), STR (Strength), CON (Constitution), SIZ (Size), APP (Appearance), DEX (Dexterity), and INT (Intelligence). Players should consider how their attributes will affect their character's abilities and interactions.
5. **Skills**: Skills are used to determine how well an investigator can perform various tasks. Players should choose skills that fit their character concept and background.
",,,,"When starting a game of Call of Cthulhu, it is advised that the Keeper provides the players with some background information on the period in which the game is set. This is usually done to encourage the players to 
keep their period setting knowledge in mind when generating their investigators.

motivated. The players will pick up on what you are giving them verbally, so be sure to keep control of non-player characters and the world around the players’ investigators. 

When the players have decided on their investigators, the Keeper should take a close look to ensure that no one investigator is going to dominate the game. If one player has created a highly powerful investigator, it may be 
necessary for the Keeper to even the odds by adding a complication or two to that investigator’s backstory.

First, the Keeper should tell the players a little about the time and place in which the game is set. This could be a specific historical period, or a general era such as the 1920s or the future. 

Next, the Keeper should say a little about the situation or events that the investigators find themselves in at the start of the game. This could be a general situation, such as, “You are all members of a posse, hunting down a cultist,” or a more specific situation, such as, “You wake up in a hospital with no memory of who you are or how you got there.”

The Keeper should also provide some background information for each investigator, in the form of a backstory. This need only be a few sentences for each investigator, but it helps to drive the sense of identity for the player. 

The  Keeper  should  also  provide  some  information  about  the 
other people the investigators are likely to meet during the game.

investigators are from the present day and are trapped in a situ-
ation where they are forced to deal with the horror of the Cthul-
hu Mythos in a more modern-day setting. This may be the case

* Magical beings

NPCs can serve various purposes in a game, such as:

major, such as the main villain of the scenario. 

You may also create a backstory for a non-player character 
that goes beyond the simple role of antagonist or informant. A 
fully detailed non-player character can be used as the focus of 
a whole scenario, where the investigators must deal with the

In the context of video games, movies, and literature, an NPC is a character that is controlled by the game or story, rather than a player. They are often used to populate the game world, provide information, or serve as obstacles or allies to the player.

In video games, NPCs can be found in various forms, such as:

1. Townspeople: They can be found in towns, cities, or villages, and often provide quests, information, or services to the player.
2. Enemies: They can be hostile characters that the player must defeat in order to progress through the game.
3. Allies: They can be characters that assist the player in their quest or provide support.
4. Merchants: They can sell items or services to the player.
5. Guards: They can be characters that patrol areas and enforce rules or restrictions.

In movies and literature, NPCs can be characters that are not central to the main plot but still play a role in the story. They can be used to add depth and realism to the narrative.

they are the “extras” in a film, a population of people for the 
investigators to interact with. The Keeper can call upon these 
“extras” as and when required. 

The  Keeper  may  be  required  to  figure  the  statistics  for 
some  NPCs  (though  often  their  stats  will  be  provided  in 
published scenarios), as well as decide their motivation and 
role in the scenario. The Keeper may also decide what skills 
the non-player characters understand and are proficient in. 

While  playing,  the  Keeper  will  be  describing  most 
non-player characters and will thus be “in character” and

In a typical idea roll, a player or the game master (GM) rolls a dice (usually a d20, a 20-sided die) and adds a relevant skill or ability score to the roll. The result of the roll is then used to determine the success or failure of the action, but also to generate a creative solution or idea.

The idea roll is often used in situations where the player is faced with a problem or challenge, but they don't have a clear idea of how to solve it. By rolling the dice, the player can generate a random idea or solution, which can be used to overcome the challenge.

In D&D, an idea roll is a mechanic used to resolve creative or problem-solving challenges, particularly when players are trying to come up with innovative solutions or ideas.

When a player is faced with a creative challenge, they can choose to make an ""idea roll"" by rolling a dice (usually a d20) and adding a relevant skill or ability score to the roll. The goal is to achieve a high enough total to succeed in generating a creative solution.

The idea roll mechanic serves several purposes:

1.  **Encouraging creativity**: By making the outcome of creative challenges uncertain, the idea roll encourages players to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions.
2.  **Adding a layer of unpredictability**: The roll introduces an element of chance, making the outcome of the challenge more dynamic and exciting.
3.  **Providing a framework for collaborative problem-solving**: The idea roll can facilitate collaboration among players, as they work together to come up with a solution that meets the required threshold.

First, the player makes an Idea Roll to see if the investigators 
get a clue. If this is successful, the Keeper provides the players

to do and the Keeper can press the advantage that this gives the 
investigators’  adversaries  and  give  the  players  a  strong  hint 
or  clear  direction  on  where  the  game  is  going  next  (note 
the use of the word “strong” here—this is not a guarantee, but 
a likely event). 

If the players have reached a point where they are stuck, the 
Keeper can offer them a “hint” in the form of a “strong rec-
ommendation” that they may wish to follow. This is not a roll, 
but may involve a significant risk for the investigators.

The most well-known version of the Key of Solomon is the ""Clavicula Salomonis,"" which was published in the 17th century by a French occultist named Samuel Liddell Mathers. This version is based on earlier manuscripts and has become the standard reference for modern occultists and practitioners of ceremonial magic.

So, while the original ideas and concepts in the Key of Solomon may date back to ancient times, the written versions of the book as we know them today were likely written in the 14th to 17th centuries AD.",,,,"The  authorship  and  exact  date  of  writing  of  the  Key  of 
Solomon  are  unknown.  It  is  traditionally  attributed  to  King 
Solomon, who is said to have written it in the 10th century BC. 
However, the existing versions of the text are all medieval manu-
scripts, with the earliest known versions dating to the 14th century 
AD.  The  Key  of  Solomon  is  a  grimoire,  a  book  of  spells  and 
incantations, purporting to reveal to the reader how to contact 
and  command  a  variety  of  demons  and  other  entities.  The 
books also allegedly tell how to create and summon demon-sum-
moning  devices,  such  as  the  fabled  Pentacle  of  planar  rule. 
The  books  also  allegedly  contain  the  spells  Summon/Bind 
Byakhee,  Contact  Deity/ Kthulhut,  Contact  Deity/Yog-So-
thoth, Contact Deity/Zhothaqquah, Create Gate,",,,,"The  authorship  and  exact  date  of  the  writing  of  the  Key 
of Solomon are unknown. The book is ascribed to King Solomon, 
an ancient Israelite king, but this ascription is likely to be a 
false one, intended to lend the book authority. Many manuscripts 
of the Key of Solomon exist, but none of them original. The 
earliest extant versions date to the 14th century. 

The  book  is  in  two  main  parts:  the  first  a  theoretical 
treatise on magic, the second a practical guide to spells. The 
latter half is often missing from extant manuscripts.

The earliest known manuscripts of the Key of Solomon date back to the 14th century, specifically to the 1300s.

However, the text is believed to have undergone significant changes and additions over the centuries, with different versions and translations emerging in various languages, including Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin. The modern versions of the Key of Solomon are often based on the 15th-century Latin translation by Johann Trithemius, a German abbot and occultist.

Altering a Spell
A caster may alter a spell that they have learned. The Keeper 
must decide on the consequences of doing so. The Keeper 
should not allow a player to alter a spell",,,,"The main spell classes are Enchant, Enchantment, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation.",,,,"In Dungeons & Dragons, there are several spell classes, which are the primary ways that players cast spells. Here are the main spell classes:

2. **Cleric**: Clerics are devoted servants of a higher power, using their faith to heal wounds, protect allies, and smite enemies. They can cast spells related to healing, protection, and divine magic.

3. **Druid**: Druids are nature-based spellcasters who tap into the power of the natural world to summon animals, control the elements, and heal the land. They can cast spells related to nature, animal companions, and elemental magic.

4. **Fighter**: Fighters are skilled warriors who use their martial prowess to take down enemies. They can cast spells related to damage, defense, and combat.

1. **Abjuration**: Spells that protect, banish, or repel. These spells often create barriers, seal doors, or prevent harm from reaching the caster or their allies.
2. **Conjuration**: Spells that summon or create objects, creatures, or effects. These spells can bring forth magical items, creatures, or even entire environments.
3. **Divination**: Spells that provide insight, predict the future, or reveal hidden information. These spells often grant the caster knowledge about the past, present, or future.

7. **Necromancy**: Spells that manipulate death, the undead, or the spirits",,,,"In the main, spells in the Call of Cthulhu game are classed as 
Mythos or Non-Mythos. 

Non-Mythos spells can be found in the Grimoire at the back 
of this book and in certain Mythos tomes. They are organized 
alphabetically by name. Each spell has a cost in magic points, 
Sanity points (if appropriate), and POW that must be factored 
into the character’s build. Learning a spell may take weeks, a 
month or more. The Keeper decides on the time required. The 
study of a tome is an important factor and can add greatly to 
the learning time. The Keeper should never feel constrained to 
use the rules for learning a spell in the manner it is presented 
in this chapter; every scenario, player, and group is different. 
Some players will hurry through the process, while others will 
delve deeply into it. Be prepared to be creative and to make 
judgments about the pace of the game.

A Note About the Magic of the Cthulhu Mythos
In the stories of H.P. Lovecraft, magic is weak and of little 
importance  to  the  greater  cosmic  scheme",,,,"In the world of the Cthulhu Mythos, spells are broadly divided 
into four main classes: Creation, Divination, Enchantment, and 
Summoning.  Each  class  of  spells  finds  its  counterpart  in 
Mythos  magic.  Non-Mythos  spells  are  listed  in  the  other 
categories, depending which of these four classes they most fit.

Creation Spells
These  spells  create  physical  objects  or  entities  from  other 
dimensions.  Such  spells  require  the  sacrifice  of  POW  to 
""pay"" for the energy needed to create the desired object or be-
ing. The object created lasts until destroyed or dispelled. 

Voluminous  manuscripts  are  alleged  to  exist  that  pro-
vide the rituals and formulas for creating gates to other dimen-
sions,  and  brewing  the  fabled  space-mead  that  allows  the 
imbiber to see into other dimensions.

alchemy to manipulate reality and create new dimensions.

Spells and Magic
Spells  are  a  conduit  to  the  Mythos  and  to  the  horrors  of 
the Cthulhu Mythos. Spells can be found in tomes as well as 
being passed down from person to person as magical formulas. 
A  successful  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  roll  is  always  a  great 
help to an investigator learning a spell.

The Keeper may wish to use the following guide to set the 
difficulty level for an investigator to learn a spell from a book. 
The initial reading roll is of Regular difficulty. If the reader 
is  unable  to  roll  an  Extreme  success  on  a  subsequent 
reading, the book’s secrets have perhaps best been left un-
explored or the investigator should seek external help (such 
as referring to another investigator who has successfully read 
the book, or seeking advice from the Keeper).

* Creation spells (e.g., Create Zombie)
* Deeper Magic spells
* Learning spells
* Altering spells
* Casting spells

Here are the main spell classes:

1. **Abjuration**: Spells that protect, banish, or repel enemies, often creating barriers or shields to prevent harm.
2. **Alteration**: Spells that change the form or properties of objects, creatures, or environments, such as transmutation, polymorph, or shape-shifting.
3. **Charm**: Spells that influence the minds or emotions of creatures, often making them more friendly, obedient, or confused.
4. **Conjuration**: Spells that summon or create objects, creatures, or effects from another plane of existence, such as teleportation, summoning, or creation.

eight groups, each reflecting the type of magic they represent.

First Spell: A first spell can be any spell the Keeper wishes, 
but it must be a spell from the standard spells of the same school 
as the tome. The Keeper is encouraged to choose a lesser-known 
spell for the first spell, to maintain mystery and surprise.

Mythos Hardened: Investigators who have 20 or more points 
of Cthulhu Mythos skill are no longer susceptible to the effects 
of mythonium poisoning.

Poisons  requiring  a  roll  for  damage  are  treated  as  a  new 
form of poison. The Keeper should determine the appropriate 
effect and duration of the poison, and whether a Medicine roll 
is allowed to treat it.

The Keeper should add a poison to a monster’s attack if it 
makes sense to do so. Many monsters are capable of injecting, 
seeping, or being eaten by their victims, and many have venom 
in their bites and stings.

The Keeper should decide on the correct poison for the sit-
uation, or roll 1D10 on Table IX: Sample Poisons. The victim",,,,"In the  Call  of  Cthulhu  roleplaying  game,  spells  are  divid-
ed  into  eight  classes.  Each  class  of  spells  suits  a  particular 
theme or aspect of magic, and often implies a certain school of 
thought or method of approach. 

Whether one uses the term spell, chant, rite, or ritual, such 
a  performance  always  requires  concentration,  devotion,  and 
specific  conditions  from  the  caster.  A  successful  casting  of 
a spell produces a definite spell effect.

The classes of spells and the spells within each class are not 
mutually exclusive; for example, many Create Zombie spells also 
have Summon/Bind Zombie as alternatives. A given spell may be 
found in more than one spell book if it appears in multiple books. 

The Keeper should modify spells and spells lists according to 
the scenario and campaign. A spell may be more or less pow-
erful, have different side effects, or require a different spell cast-
ing time. A spell may be unique in some way; perhaps it can be 
cast only at certain locations or times, or it requires a part of

The Contact Spell,Contact Deity/Nyarlathotep,,,,"Contact Spells

Contact spells are divided into two separate groups: spells 
concerned with contacting Mythos deities and spells for 
contacting non-Mythos entities. Using Contact spells a 
cultist could get in touch with monsters and alien races, 
perhaps to learn about magic, gods, or alien species. The 
caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might 
be struck and plans negotiated. Remember these are in-
dependent beings with their own motivations—casters make 
contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Sum-
moning Spells (see page 263) that have the potential to al-
low casters to bind the summoned beings to their will. 

Contact Deity Spells

Casting time: 1 hour
The Contact Deity spell can be used to contact any deity. The 
caster must know the deity and must have an established 
line of communication with it. For example, if the caster 
has previously received dreams or visions from the deity, or 
if the deity has previously possessed or possessed-crazed the 
caster.  The  caster  should  also  have  some  reason  to  want 
to  contact  the  deity—",,,,Contact Deity,,,,"In the context of Dungeons & Dragons, there isn't a specific spell that a cultist can use to directly ""get in touch"" with alien races. However, there are spells that can facilitate communication or allow the cultist to gather information about other species.

One possible option could be the ""Detect Magic"" spell, which allows the caster to sense magical auras and detect the presence of magical creatures or objects. This could potentially help the cultist gather information about alien species that are sensitive to magic.

Another option could be the ""Detect Life"" spell, which allows the caster to sense the presence of living creatures, including potentially alien species. This could also provide the cultist with information about the alien's biology and behavior.

It's worth noting that the cultist would likely need to have a good understanding of the alien species' biology and behavior in order to effectively use these spells. Additionally, the cultist would need to be careful not to disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem or harm the alien species in any way.

One spell that might fit the bill is ""Contact Other Plane"" (PHB, p. 253). This spell allows the caster to establish a telepathic link with a being on another plane of existence. However, it's worth noting that this spell doesn't specifically target alien races, but rather any being on another plane.

Another option could be ""Gate"" (PHB, p. 294), which creates a portal to another plane of existence. While not directly a communication spell, it could potentially be used to summon or contact alien beings.

In some campaign settings, like the ""Planescape"" setting, there are specific spells and rituals that allow for communication with various planar entities, including alien races. However, these are setting-specific and not part of the core rules.

Contact Deep One: The cultist tries to contact deep ones. The spell 
must be cast at a coastline, sea-loch, or other saltwater lake. The 
casters must have a deck of tarot cards and a book on the magic 
of Dagon. As the cultists dance around the alter, they draw cards 
from the deck, each one representing an organ of the body. For 
each organ, they must roll under the percentiles on the card. For 
each organ that fails, the caster loses 1D3 CON. For each organ 
that succeeds, the caster gains 1D3 DEX. In the case of a tie, the 
organ is unaffected. The spell lasts 24 hours or until the caster’s 
DEX reaches zero. 

Contact  Elder  Thing:  The  caster  expends  1  magic  point 
per 10 feet of the elder thing’s distance from the caster. Elder 
things normally inhabit the stars, so this spell can reach any 
distance. The caster must know the elder thing’s correct loca-

the Keeper should decide on the spot whether to ask for rolls 
for STR, CON, or DEX, or a combination thereof, and whether 
to allow or demand the use of weapons.

Human Limits
Where  a  monster  is  described  as  being  able  to  perform 
a  particular  action,  the  Keeper  should  not  require  a  roll  to 
accomplish it. For example, no roll is required for a deep one 
to swim or for a fire vampire to fly. 

The  actions  of  monsters  should  be  played  out  within 
the game much like those of the investigators. Describe the 
monster’s actions, and then ask the player what actions the 
investigator is taking. This two-way communication is the 
heart of the game.

When the Keeper makes a statement about what some or 
all of the monsters are doing, the players should respond with",,,,"In  Call  of  Cthulhu,  each  monster  or  beast  has  certain 
characteristics,  skills,  and  equipment  listed,  together  with

fight back. 

Where  applicable,  the  different  versions  of  a  monster 
provide  an  explanation  of  the  ways  in  which  the  creature 
can change, such as the various stages of a chthonian’s life cycle.

Keepers  are  reminded  that  these  are  alien  creatures 
with  no  human  equivalent,  and  thus  characteristics  and 
skills  should  be  adjusted  and  modified  as  the  Keeper  sees 
fit.  The  Keeper  should  also  feel  free  to  block  out  whole 
characteristics or skills if it makes sense to do so. For example,

the physical size and strength of a character. The build of a human

build of 0 or 6. A build of 0 would imply a child or frail person,

In the game, the build of a character determines the amount 
of  damage  they  can  inflict  in  a  fist  fight  (see  Table  XVII: 
Damage Bonus and Build, page 401). Build also affects the char-
acter’s  hit  points  (see  Table  XVII:  Damage  Bonus  and  Build, 
page 401). 

In the game, characteristic values are used as a guide to create 
an image of an investigator that feels real to the player. The age

attributes of Strength, Constitution, Size, and Dexterity. The

This mass is made up of thousands of tiny,

providing a pseudopod with which to grasp prey or an additional limb with which to 
perform some manipulative task. The bulk of a crawling one is a translucent, 
semi-elastic mass, formed from the tips of the many appendages. It is this bulk that 
contains the crawling one's vital organs and with which it interacts with its environment. 
When the creature dies, its bulk ruptures and deflates with a disgusting 
popping sound, and the thousands of appendages shrivel up and 
break off, some still writhing and twisting in the ground.

Crawling ones look like elongated globular masses covered in 
thin, semi-elastic tentacles. These appendages can be retracted 
into the body at will. The creatures do not have any truly internal 
organs, with all essential functions performed by the central 
bulk.",,,,"In the most commonly known descriptions, a crawling one is composed

The  central  mass  of  a  crawling  one  dissipates  after  it  has
