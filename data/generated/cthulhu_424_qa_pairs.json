  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, the investigators encounter a truck on the road, which may be used by a servant of Gla'aki, a malevolent deity. The truck's driver, James Stanton, is hostile and demands that the investigators leave the trail, but he won't actively try to stop them. Meanwhile, a rifle-scope-wielding investigator, Eugene Clayton, is positioned on a ridge to spot the investigators, and may fire a warning shot if he spots them. The investigators must then navigate the situation, potentially using Stealth rolls to get to Eugene without being shot, or fleeing the area to avoid becoming targets.",
