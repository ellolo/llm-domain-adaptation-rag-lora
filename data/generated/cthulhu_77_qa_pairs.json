  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document outlines three skills in the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game: Stealth, Ride, and Science. Stealth involves understanding and observing a target without being detected, while Ride involves handling and riding a mount, such as a horse or donkey. Both skills have regular and hard difficulty levels, with pushing examples that demonstrate extreme or reckless behavior. Failing these skills can result in various consequences, including the target becoming aware of the observer, the rider being thrown from the mount, or the investigator becoming obsessed with the animal.",
