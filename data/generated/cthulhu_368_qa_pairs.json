  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nAzathoth is a powerful, amorphous deity in the Cthulhu Mythos, often referred to as the \"monstrous nuclear chaos\" at the center of the universe. As the ruler of the gods, Azathoth is blind and idiotic, yet its urges are immediately fulfilled by Nyarlathotep. Worshiping Azathoth is rare and often unintentional, and those who do so may gain insight into the nature of the universe, but at the risk of disaster and horror. Azathoth's behavior is unpredictable, growing in power and reach with each combat round, and summoners must carefully manage their magic points to placate the god.",
