  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the \"Escaping the Pursuer\" scenario from the Call of Cthulhu game, a character named Harvey is being chased by the police. The police car can accelerate to move multiple locations in one movement action, but this comes with risks, including penalty dice for hazard rolls. The Keeper can call for a sudden hazard at any time, and players can choose to accelerate to gain speed, but must be prepared for the consequences. The game mechanics allow for a dynamic and unpredictable chase, with the pursuer's speed and the environment affecting the outcome.",
