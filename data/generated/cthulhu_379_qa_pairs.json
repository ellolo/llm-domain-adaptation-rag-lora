  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nGla'aki, a Great Old One, is a powerful and malevolent entity that dwells at the bottom of a lake in the Severn River Valley in England. It summons new cultists through hypnotic dreams, known as the \"dream-pull,\" which can draw victims to the lake for initiation. Once initiated, victims are transformed into undead slaves, serving Gla'aki. Gla'aki's powers include attacks with tentacles, summoning and binding spells, and regenerating hit points. Its current weakness makes it unable to send the dream-pull far, but it can still dispatch servants to capture or guide new initiates.",
