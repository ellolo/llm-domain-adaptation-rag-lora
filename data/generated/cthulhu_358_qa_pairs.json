  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Shantak is a monstrous, insectoid creature from Lovecraftian mythology that serves as a mental parasite, infecting its victims with its \"nerve whip\" or \"meld\" abilities. These creatures have a 60% chance of successfully melding into a human's head, gaining control and causing the victim to become an unsuitable host. Shantaks are known to be used as steeds by servants of the Outer Gods, including Azathoth, and are feared by nightgaunts. They possess no innate fighting skill, but can inflict significant damage with their nerve whip attack. Shantaks are also capable of flying through space and carrying unwary riders to the throne of Azathoth.",
