  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this game system, the Keeper sets the difficulty level for challenges, using levels such as Regular, Hard, and Extreme, depending on the situation. The Keeper should frame situations in a way that allows the player to roll dice, rather than rolling them themselves. When the player rolls dice, success or failure is determined by the Keeper, with the Keeper using the player's skill levels to set the target number. The Keeper's role is to interpret the outcome of the roll and adjust the story accordingly, while the player is encouraged to describe the outcome of a successful roll.",
