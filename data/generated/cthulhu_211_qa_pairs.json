To achieve this, the Keeper can veto the player's comments, veto subsequent dice rolls, or create consequences for failure. The Keeper should also follow specific rules, such as not allowing consecutive rolls against the same skill and rolling dice in full view. Additionally, the Keeper should set difficulty levels that are consistent for all players, regardless of their skill level, and reserve dice rolls for important and dramatic moments.",
