  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop game, vehicle damage and movement are calculated using a combination of hit points and build ratings. Vehicles with higher build ratings are more resilient to damage, while those with lower build ratings are more susceptible. The movement rating (MOV) of a vehicle also affects its speed and maneuverability in chases. Vehicles that suffer significant damage may be impaired or completely wrecked, with occupants potentially dying. The Keeper has discretion to determine the outcome of such incidents, with luck rolls potentially influencing the survival of those involved.",
