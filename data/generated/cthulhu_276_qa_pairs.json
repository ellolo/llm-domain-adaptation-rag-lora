  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this section of the Grimoire, various spells are described, including Call, Contact, and Summon spells, which can be used for different purposes such as worship, communication, and binding of monsters. Call spells bring physical manifestations of gods, while Contact spells allow for communication with gods or monsters, and Summon spells compel monsters to appear before the caster. To cast these spells, wizards must have sufficient magic points, POW, and sometimes make moral or sacrificial choices. The spells can also have consequences, such as the need to bind or control summoned monsters, and the risk of losing one's own life essence or vital organs.",
