  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Natural World skill represents traditional knowledge and personal observation of the natural world, allowing characters to identify species, habits, and habitats, as well as track and call animals. This skill is often inaccurate, but can be useful for general judgments and decisions, such as judging horseflesh at a county fair. Failing a Natural World roll can lead to humorous consequences, such as getting facts wrong or picking the wrong mushroom. In contrast, the Navigate skill allows characters to find their way in various conditions, using astronomical tables, charts, and instruments.",
