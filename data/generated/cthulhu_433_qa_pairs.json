  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIf investigators are taken captive, they can attempt to escape by making Hard DEX rolls to break free from their bonds. Alternatively, they can wait until nightfall and observe the site, noting the undead servants' activities and the construction of a pulley system to retrieve a crystal. If the investigators fail to intervene, the servants will use the crystal to summon Gla'aki, a powerful entity that will drain its power and potentially drive witnesses mad. The outcome ultimately depends on the Keeper's discretion, with the goal of thwarting the investigators' escape and fulfilling the dark rituals of the servants.",
