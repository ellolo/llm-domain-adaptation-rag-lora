  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a chase scene, the Keeper divides the chase into narrative chunks, or locations, rather than physical distance, to create a more dynamic and engaging experience. The chase is made up of a string of locations, with characters moving 1 or more locations per round, and hazards and barriers slowing their progress. The Keeper tracks the characters' positions using a method such as a grid of dots or miniatures, and determines the order of movement based on the characters' DEX scores. The pace of the chase is controlled by the number of movement actions each character has per round, with faster characters getting more.",
