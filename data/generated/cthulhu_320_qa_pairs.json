  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, combat encounters are designed to be more dynamic and creative. The Fighting skill is used to describe a monster's standard attack, but to avoid repetition, the Keeper can use the damage listed for the monster's standard attack to determine damage for any variation of the attack. This allows the Keeper to describe the monster's attacks in a more imaginative and engaging way. Additionally, Maneuvers, which use the monster's Fighting skill, can be used to describe more complex attacks, but must take into account the build difference between the monster and its opponent.",
