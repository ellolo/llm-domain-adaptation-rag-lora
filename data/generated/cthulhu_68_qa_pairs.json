  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes two skills in a fictional investigative system: Pushed and Listen. Pushed enables investigators to find information in a library, but requires Persuade, Fast Talk, Charm, or other skills to gain access. Failing a Pushed roll can result in various consequences, including finding misleading information or getting into arguments with librarians. Listen, on the other hand, measures an investigator's ability to interpret and understand sound, and can be opposed by Stealth.",
