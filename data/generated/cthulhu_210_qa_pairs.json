  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game \"Call of Cthulhu,\" the Keeper has the authority to decide when and how skill rolls are used to determine the outcome of tasks. The Keeper's role is to define the outcome of a failed skill roll, rather than the dice roll itself, and to ensure that the game moves forward in a logical and coherent manner. The Keeper should aim to create a narrative that is driven by the players' actions, rather than the dice rolls. This approach allows the Keeper to control the pace and direction of the game, while still giving players agency and control over their characters.",
