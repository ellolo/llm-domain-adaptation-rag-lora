Skills above 90% can be improved by rolling 1D10, adding points to the skill, and gaining Sanity points. Additionally, players can also gain Sanity points through spending time with aspects from their backstory, check their Credit Rating, and reduce their Sanity limits. The game also allows players to alter their Investigator's backstory and manage their finances, with guidelines provided for these activities.",
