  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, characters can switch between different modes of movement, such as flying, swimming, or driving, which affects their Movement (MOV) rate. When a character joins a chase, their MOV rate must be at least equal to the slowest fleeing character to be considered. If a character joins a chase as a fleeing character, their MOV rate must exceed the slowest member of the chase, requiring adjustments to movement actions. Additionally, characters can create hazards or barriers through their actions, which may require movement actions, skill rolls, or both.",
