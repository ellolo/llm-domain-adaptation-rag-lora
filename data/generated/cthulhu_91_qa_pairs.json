  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, the Keeper has the discretion to determine the outcome of failed dice rolls, allowing for creative and non-sudden endings. The Keeper can choose to have multiple players attempt the same skill roll, such as researching a book or administering first aid, or allow individual players to attempt the task separately. This approach can add complexity and nuance to the game, while also providing opportunities for players to work together and contribute to the outcome. The Keeper's decisions should be guided by the game's mechanics and the players' intentions, and may involve pushing dice rolls or allowing multiple attempts.",
