  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Cthulhu Mythos system allows characters to gain temporary increases in Power (POW) through various means, such as casting successful spells, exercising POW, or receiving gifts from Mythos deities. This increase in POW can be permanent if the character rolls a high percentile dice result. The system also introduces the concept of non-Mythos magic, which can be significant in the game but requires the Keeper's approval and may have different mechanics and procedures. Additionally, the system includes optional rules, such as the Spontaneous Use of the Cthulhu Mythos Skill, which allows characters to improvise magical effects.",
