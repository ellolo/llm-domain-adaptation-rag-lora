  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, investigators can experience mental trauma and insanity due to their exposure to the Cthulhu Mythos. To cope with this, players can use various methods such as therapy, self-help, or seeking healing from a key connection in their backstory. These methods involve making Sanity rolls, which can result in gaining or losing Sanity points, and can be influenced by the player's roleplaying and the Keeper's discretion. The goal is to help the investigator recover from mental trauma and maintain their Sanity points within a reasonable limit.",
