  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game system, skill rolls are used to determine success or failure in various tasks. The difficulty level of a task is determined by the opposing skill or characteristic, with different levels of difficulty requiring different levels of success (Critical, Extreme, Hard, or Regular). Opposed rolls are used when two players are competing against each other, with the outcome determined by the best level of success. The game also features bonus dice and penalty dice that can be used to modify the outcome of skill rolls, and investigators can develop their skills through a process of rolling dice and determining success or failure.",
