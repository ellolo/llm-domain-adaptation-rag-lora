  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe investigators have arrived at Turner's cabin, where they find a diary belonging to Joseph Turner, detailing his backstory. However, the main focus is on the five surviving artists, who have been strapped to poles near a stagnant lake, where they were brutally attacked by Gla'aki, a malevolent entity. If the investigators can free the artists, they will reveal a terrifying tale of a terrible entity in the water, spreading a sickness among them. The outcome depends on the investigators' actions, including Stealth rolls to avoid detection, and the consequences of failure, such as being captured or driven mad.",
