  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, firearms malfunctions can occur when a character attempts to fire a weapon and rolls a result equal to or higher than the weapon's malfunction number. This can result in a jammed or misfiring weapon, which can be fixed with a successful Mechanical Repair roll or Firearms skill roll. The Keeper should describe the effects of damage and try to avoid simply stating the number of hit points lost, instead using descriptive language to convey the severity of the injury. The document also provides guidelines for tracking damage and differentiating between regular and major wounds.",
