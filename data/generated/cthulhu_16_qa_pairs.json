  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nH.P. Lovecraft was a prolific letter writer who regularly corresponded with other fiction writers, including Clark Ashton Smith and Robert E. Howard. This exchange of ideas led to the creation of shared mythological elements, such as the Necronomicon and the deities Tsathoggua and Atlach-Nacha. Lovecraft's works were influenced by various authors, including Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Machen, and Lord Dunsany, who contributed to the development of his Cthulhu Mythos. As Lovecraft's career progressed, he began to incorporate elements from his earlier tales into his later stories, often at the suggestion of his younger correspondents.",
