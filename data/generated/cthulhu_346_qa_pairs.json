They can materialize through any sharp corner and are driven off by their targets, but can be difficult to repel. These creatures are known for their razor-sharp teeth, claws, and pulsating blue-tinged skin, and are capable of inflicting significant damage. They possess magical abilities, including spells that can be cast by each hound, and can leave behind a gout of bluish pus, known as ichor, after attacking their victims.",
