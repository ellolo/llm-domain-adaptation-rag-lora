  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe horror genre can be a fun and effective way to scare players, but it requires a different approach than traditional horror movies. To create a sense of fear and tension, game designers should focus on confounding players' expectations of how the \"real\" world works, rather than simply introducing monsters or supernatural events. This can be achieved through cognitive dissonance, where players are presented with conflicting ideas or situations that challenge their understanding of reality. By presenting players with problems and complications, and then introducing additional challenges, game designers can create a sense of escalating tension and terror.",
