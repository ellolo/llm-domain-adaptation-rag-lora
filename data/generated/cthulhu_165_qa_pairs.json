  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the investigators' sanity is a crucial aspect of the game, and encounters with strange entities, lost or destroyed items, and other events can trigger bouts of madness. A bout of madness can take two forms: real-time, where the investigator experiences a specific effect for a set number of rounds, or summary, where the Keeper determines the effect based on a roll. The document outlines various effects of madness, including amnesia, psychosomatic disabilities, violence, paranoia, and phobias, among others. The Keeper's discretion plays a significant role in determining the outcome of a bout of madness, and the game master must carefully manage the investigator's sanity to create a thrilling and unpredictable experience.",
