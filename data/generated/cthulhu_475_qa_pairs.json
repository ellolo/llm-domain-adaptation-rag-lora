  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the 7th edition of Call of Cthulhu, the game's mechanics have been updated to unify characteristics and skills, making it easier to compare and calculate rolls. The decision was made to separate Luck from POW, as POW is significant elsewhere in the game, and to roll Luck randomly (3D6 x 5). Additionally, the game's characteristic system has been revised, with the STR, DEX, CON, SIZ, APP, INT, POW, and EDU characteristics now providing one-fifth values, which can be multiplied by five and divided by two to calculate full values.",

      "question": "What is the main goal of unifying characteristics and skills?",
      "answer": "to make it easier to compare and make opposed rolls using a mixture of skills and characteristics"

    },
    {
      "question": "Why were the original ideas to link base skill in Charm to Appearances and Dodge to DEX not used?",
      "answer": "Three reasons: using characteristic values introduces additional work during investigator creation, the benefit of using one-fifth of the characteristic did not seem significant enough to justify the added complication, and the characteristics feed into skill points to a limited degree."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the characteristic used to calculate skill points?",
      "answer": "A variety of characteristics are used to calculate skill points, depending on your investigator\u2019s chosen occupation."

      "question": "How do you get the full value of a characteristic?",
      "answer": "Multiply the one-fifth value by five for the full value."

    {
      "question": "What is the process for calculating the one-half value of Luck points and hit points?",
      "answer": "Multiply these by five for the full values and divide this new value by two, rounding down, for the one-half value."
