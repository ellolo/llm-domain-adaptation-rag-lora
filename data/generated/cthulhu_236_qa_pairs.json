  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, magic is a mysterious and mutable force that can be used by investigators to achieve their goals. When using magic, consistency is not a requirement, and the rules encourage players to incorporate their own ideas for hazards and consequences. The use of the Cthulhu Mythos skill, including spontaneous magic, should be handled with care to avoid giving players disproportionate power. When setting goals for the use of Cthulhu Mythos skill, it's essential to consider the costs and requirements, and to make sure the consequences of failure are dire and unique.",
