  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nGhasts and Ghasts are two types of formless, cannibalistic creatures that inhabit the underworld and vast caverns, where sunlight never reaches. They are restricted to these environments and are sensitive to direct sunlight, which causes them to sicken and eventually die. Ghasts are capable of attacking and swallowing prey, dealing damage and potentially gaining sanity points, while also being vulnerable to physical attacks and able to dodge. They have unique characteristics, such as their ability to swallow prey and digest it, and are often found in conjunction with other, more humanoid creatures.",
