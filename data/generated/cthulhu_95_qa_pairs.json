  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, opposed rolls can be used to determine the outcome of non-combat interactions between investigators and non-player characters (NPCs). To make an opposed roll, both sides declare a mutually exclusive goal and select a skill or characteristic to use, which are then compared to determine success. The Keeper can apply bonuses or penalties to the rolls, and the results are compared using a tiered system, with Critical success beating Extreme success, and so on. This system allows for more nuanced and dramatic outcomes in non-combat interactions.",
