  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this section of the game, the Keeper and players describe a combat scenario between Old Man Birch and Harvey. To determine the outcome of the combat, the Keeper uses the \"Build\" of the two characters to compare their relative capabilities. If the attacker has a smaller Build, they may take penalty dice, while if the opponent exceeds the attacker's Build by three or more, the maneuver is ineffective. The section also explains the concept of \"Fighting Maneuvers,\" which require a Definite Goal, such as disarming or seizing an opponent.",
