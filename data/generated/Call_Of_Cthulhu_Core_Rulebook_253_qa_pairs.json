Each version is associated with a different translator and has similar content, including spells and incantations to summon and bind various entities from the Cthulhu Mythos. The book is said to have been written by the wizard Eibon, who gained knowledge and power through a pact with the god Tsathoggua, but was later persecuted by the priests of Yhoundeth. The book's origins are shrouded in mystery, with some attributing its creation to Atlantis and its spread to Europe through trade and migration.",
