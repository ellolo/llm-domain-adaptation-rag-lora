  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Lovecraftian universe, a shoggoth is a monstrous, amorphous creature that can engulf and crush multiple targets, dealing massive damage. When a shoggoth attacks, it can engulf multiple victims, each of whom must make a successful opposed STR roll to avoid being sucked apart. Shoggoths can also regenerate hit points and have various vulnerabilities, such as being unable to withstand fire and electrical attacks. Additionally, there are smaller, intelligent shoggoth-like creatures known as Shoggoth Lords, which are cunning and charming but have a tendency to melt down into their monstrous forms when threatened or distracted.",
