  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a horror-themed game, the Keeper should plan out the investigators' backstories from the outset to create a cohesive narrative. This can involve corrupting or distorting existing backstory entries as the game progresses, which can be done by adding or amending entries to reflect the investigator's growing madness or realization about their own bloodline. The Keeper can also delay changes to backstory entries if needed, allowing for more flexibility in the game. This approach helps to maintain continuity and creates a more immersive story for the players.",
