  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this game system, establishing contacts with non-player characters (NPCs) can be crucial for investigators. Players can use various skills, such as Chemistry, Medicine, or Own Language, to establish contacts, with the Keeper adjusting the difficulty level based on location and other factors. A successful roll can lead to a contact who may be helpful or untrustworthy, depending on the outcome of a concealed dice roll. The Keeper can also use a pushed roll to determine the contact's disposition, potentially leading to an antagonistic or unreliable contact.",
