  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this game, Magic points are a vital resource for casting spells, energizing artifacts, and powering magical gates. Investigators start with a limited pool of Magic points, which can be depleted, resulting in physical damage or other effects. Magic points can be replenished naturally over time, but excess points cannot be regenerated. To learn a spell from a Mythos book, investigators must make an initial reading and then attempt a Hard INT roll, which can take hours, days, or months to complete.",
