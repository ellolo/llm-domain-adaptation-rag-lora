  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft (HPL) struggled to achieve commercial success as a writer, despite his early attempts to sell his fiction being met with unqualified success. However, after the editorship of Weird Tales passed to Farnsworth Wright, Lovecraft's fortunes changed, and he faced repeated rejections for his work. Lovecraft's writing was often ghostwritten or revised for others, and he earned most of his income from these endeavors, rather than from his own published works. Despite this, he maintained a core of fans and continued to write, eventually finding publication in amateur magazines and later in Weird Tales.",
