  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the rules for aging and education (EDU) are discussed in the context of a role-playing game. The aging effects are cumulative, with significant changes occurring at specific ages (20, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80). The EDU system allows investigators to improve their skills through education, with the Keeper deciding on the learning rate and interval. The document also provides guidelines for training and combat skill specialisms, as well as a system for self-study and experience checks.",
