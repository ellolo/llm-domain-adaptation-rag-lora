  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, presenting monsters and entities from the Cthulhu Mythos can be a crucial aspect of creating a horror-filled experience for players. To achieve this, the Keeper should focus on setting the tone and using vivid, descriptive language to hint at the otherworldliness and terror of the monsters, rather than relying on images or miniatures. By doing so, the Keeper can create a sense of dread and unease in the players, allowing their imaginations to fill in the blanks and create a more immersive experience. This approach also encourages the Keeper to vary and elaborate on monster descriptions to avoid making them feel mundane or overused.",
