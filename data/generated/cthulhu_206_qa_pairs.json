  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, the game master (Keeper) can use a concealed roll to determine how non-player characters (NPCs) react to investigators, taking into account the investigator's attributes such as APP (Attributes) and Credit Rating. This allows for a more nuanced and realistic portrayal of NPCs, who can have positive or negative reactions based on their own flaws and mistakes. The Keeper can also use props, such as portraits, to help differentiate between NPCs and keep track of their characteristics. This approach enables the Keeper to create a more immersive and engaging game world.",
