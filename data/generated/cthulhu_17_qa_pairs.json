  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nH.P. Lovecraft's later stories, particularly those written after 1928, integrated elements from his earlier tales, such as the Deep Ones, Arkham, and the Necronomicon. This integration was influenced by his younger correspondents, including Robert Bloch and Frank Belknap Long, who contributed to the development of the Cthulhu Mythos. August Derleth, a close friend and collaborator of Lovecraft, continued to write and expand on the Cthulhu Mythos after Lovecraft's death, introducing new characters and elements, such as the Tcho-Tcho people and the sand-dwellers. Derleth's efforts helped to keep Lovecraft's works in print and available to the public, ensuring the continuation of the Cthulhu Mythos.",
