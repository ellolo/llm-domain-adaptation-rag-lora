  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, investigators can encounter \"obscured clues\" that provide useful information but are not crucial to progressing the plot. When a player requests a perception roll to uncover an obscured clue, the Keeper should use a difficulty level and declare it before the roll. If the investigators fail to perceive the clue, it can create tension and provide consequences, such as wasting time, leaving evidence, or attracting unwanted attention. The Keeper can choose how the players react to missing the clue, offering them options to ignore, push, or act on it.",
