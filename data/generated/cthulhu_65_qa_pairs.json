  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the topic of \"Pushing\" is discussed, which refers to a skill used by investigators to intimidate or coerce individuals into revealing information or complying with their demands. Pushing involves taking extreme measures, such as physical harm or threats, to achieve the desired outcome. The consequences of failing a Pushed roll can be severe, including physical harm to the investigator or the target, mental trauma, or even possession by a malevolent entity. The skill of Pushing is opposed by skills such as Psychology, Charm, and Persuade, and requires a high level of difficulty and risk.",
