  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, investigators can encounter various monsters that can affect their Sanity points. To prevent excessive Sanity loss, a reasonable interval is established, such as no more than 6 Sanity points lost for encountering deep ones. The Sanity point loss can be tracked and reduced by 1 during each investigator development phase. Optional rules, such as Insane Insight and Mythos Hardened, can also be applied to enhance the game experience.",
