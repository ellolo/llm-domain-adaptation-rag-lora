  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nWhen designing a linear scenario for Call of Cthulhu, it's essential to create a clear beginning, middle, and end that sets up the whole game, provides clues and leads, and pieces together the bigger picture. A well-structured plot can be inspired by classic detective fiction, books, films, and TV shows. However, as players become more experienced and confident, they may want to deviate from the linear scenario, leading to the need for non-linear scenarios. Non-linear scenarios allow for a sandbox-style setting where players can discover interconnected plots and endings in a different order each time the scenario is played.",
