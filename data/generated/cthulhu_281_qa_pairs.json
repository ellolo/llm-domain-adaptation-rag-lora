  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document outlines two Call Deity spells in the Cthulhu Mythos: Call of Shub-Niggurath and Call Yog-Sothoth. Call of Shub-Niggurath requires a human sacrifice and a consecrated altar, while Call Yog-Sothoth involves constructing a stone tower and designating a human sacrifice. In contrast, the Dismiss Deity spell allows a deity to leave Earth without the need for a human sacrifice, requiring only magic points to be sacrificed in exchange for a higher chance of dismissal. The spell can be cast at any time and anywhere, and its success depends on the total chance of dismissal, which can be increased by contributing magic points.",
