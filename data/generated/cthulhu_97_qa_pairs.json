  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper sets the difficulty level for skill rolls and opposed rolls, which can result in bonus or penalty dice. The Keeper may also use a single dice roll to compare against multiple skills, with the Keeper specifying the required success level. Opposed rolls, such as the Ordeal of Pain, require both players to make a roll and the Keeper awards bonus or penalty dice accordingly. The Keeper's discretion is key in determining the outcome of these rolls, with the goal of creating a fun and challenging experience for the players.",
