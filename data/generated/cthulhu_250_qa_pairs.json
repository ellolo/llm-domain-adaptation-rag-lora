  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, certain books, known as \"Mythos Tomes,\" can possess a distinct \"character\" that echoes their powerful owners, such as grand sorcerers and cult potentates. These books are often bound in leather, have a musky odor, and may cause nearby books to char and blacken. Mythos Tomes can be a source of great power for investigators, but using them too freely can unbalance the game and make it predictable. The presence of these books can also drive owners to delve deeper into the Mythos and court insanity.",
