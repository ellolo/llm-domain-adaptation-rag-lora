  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, Mythos tomes can be a powerful tool for investigators, but they also come with a terrible cost: increasing descent into madness. The possession of a Mythos tome should always carry a consequence, such as a loss of sanity or a corrupted investigator background entry. These entries can be used to manipulate the game's narrative, add depth to the investigator, and provide roleplaying opportunities. The tome's influence can also lead to delusions, which can either hinder or guide the investigators' progress.",
