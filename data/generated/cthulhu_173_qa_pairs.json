  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, investigators can use Reality Check Rolls to distinguish between reality and delusions or hallucinations. A successful roll allows the investigator to see through delusions, while a failure can lead to a loss of Sanity points and potentially induce madness. Additionally, investigators can be affected by phobias, which can cause rapid symptoms such as anxiety, palpitations, and trembling when exposed to the source of their phobia. Mania is another condition that can affect investigators, characterized by an elevated mood, increased activity, and decreased need for sleep.",
