  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines the rules for combat in a fantasy setting, specifically for a character named Harvey who attempts to snatch a briefcase from a cultist. The rules for combat involve rolling a DEX score to determine the outcome of an attack, with the attacker gaining a bonus die if they succeed and the defender gaining a penalty die if they fail. The document also introduces the concept of surprise attacks, where the attacker can gain an advantage by catching the defender off guard, and fighting maneuvers, which can be used to initiate combat. The rules also cover various combat scenarios, including dodging, fighting back, and maneuvering.",
