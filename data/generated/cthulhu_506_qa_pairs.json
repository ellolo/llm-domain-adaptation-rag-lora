The severity and duration of the Bout of Madness are determined by a roll of 1D10, with different outcomes corresponding to different numbers. The document also provides guidelines for resolving the effects of a Bout of Madness, including how to determine the outcome of violent outbursts and the recovery of the investigator.",
