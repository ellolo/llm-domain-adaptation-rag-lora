  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, investigators are attempting to lift a heavy rafter that is too heavy for one person to lift. The physical human limits of the investigators are crucial in determining their ability to lift the rafter, and exceeding these limits requires multiple investigators combining their efforts. The Keeper rules that subtracting the investigators' characteristics from the rafter's SIZ can reduce the difficulty level, allowing multiple investigators to attempt the lift. This scenario highlights the importance of teamwork and strategy in overcoming physical limitations.",
