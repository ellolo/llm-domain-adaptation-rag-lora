  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, Contact spells allow cultists to establish communication with Mythos creatures and deities, but do not grant the caster control over the contacted entity. These spells require specific conditions to be met, such as proximity to certain locations or species, and involve a random member of the species appearing at the caster's location. The caster must be prepared to negotiate and potentially make a bargain, as the contacted entity's motivations are independent and unpredictable. Each version of the Contact spell has its own unique requirements and costs, ranging from 3 to 5 magic points.",
