  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, vehicles can be damaged, leading to penalties and potentially even complete wrecking. A vehicle's build is reduced by 1 point for every 10 hit points of damage, and if it reaches half its starting value or lower, it is impaired. If a vehicle takes damage equal to its full build value, it is completely wrecked, potentially leading to accidents and fatalities. Similarly, investigators can suffer from Sanity loss, which can lead to temporary or indefinite insanity, with recovery depending on treatment and Luck rolls.",
