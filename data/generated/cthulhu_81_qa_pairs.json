  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, the \"Porcelain Statuettes\" are a sample consequence of failing a Pushed roll, where an investigator is convinced that something is there, even if it's not. The Stealth skill allows characters to move quietly and hide without detection, with a difficulty level determined by the opponent's Spot Hidden or Listen skill. The Survival skill, which can be purchased with skill points, provides expertise in extreme environments, such as desert, sea, or wilderness terrain. Failing a Pushed roll can lead to various consequences, including being spotted by cultists or failing to notice important clues.",
