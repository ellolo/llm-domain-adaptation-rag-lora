  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document outlines two types of skills: Regular difficulty and Hard difficulty. Regular difficulty involves repairing or creating a standard electrical device, such as a computer, with the proper tools and parts. Hard difficulty, on the other hand, involves repairing or creating something that is badly damaged or working without proper tools, often with a higher risk of failure. The document also introduces the concept of \"Pushing\" examples, where investigators attempt to take shortcuts or risks to achieve their goals, which can lead to unpredictable consequences.",
