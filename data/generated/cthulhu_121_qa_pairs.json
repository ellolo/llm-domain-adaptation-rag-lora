  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, automatic fire is a combat tactic that allows an attacker to fire multiple shots in a single round. When using automatic fire, the player declares the number of rounds to be fired, which may be any number up to the gun's capacity. The number of bullets fired is then divided into volleys, with an attack roll made for each volley. Automatic fire can be used with full auto, burst fire, or semi-automatic fire, each with its own rules and limitations.",
