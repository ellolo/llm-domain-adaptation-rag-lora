  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu games, the Keeper can use various techniques to create a sense of immersion and provide information to players, including handouts. Handouts can be physical items such as letters, maps, or newspaper articles, or digital files like sound recordings. The Keeper can use creative methods to create these handouts, such as using old notebooks, coffee-stained paper, or fake blood, to create a realistic and engaging experience for the players. The use of handouts can also help to shift the focus from the Keeper to the players, encouraging them to read and interpret the information. Effective use of handouts can enhance the overall gameplay experience.",
