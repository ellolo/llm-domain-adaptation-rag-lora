The rules provide guidelines for calculating movement distances, determining when attacks can be made, and applying penalties for shooting through cover or using mounted weapons. The document also introduces a system for determining the effectiveness of shooting through cover, taking into account the size of the hiding space and the type of cover. Additionally, it revises the point-blank bonus die rule to exclude long or cumbersome weapons.",
