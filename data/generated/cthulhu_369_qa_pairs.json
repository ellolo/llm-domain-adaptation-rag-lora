  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nBastet, also known as Bast, is the goddess of cats in ancient Egyptian mythology. She is often depicted with a sistrum, a lion's head, and a small bag, and is associated with the cult of Bubastis. As a goddess, Bast rarely takes action, but can summon felines to aid her or personally intervene if someone is cruel to cats. In the game, Bast is a powerful character with high strength, power, and attack values, and can heal damage to herself or a cat by expending magic points. Her cult may have survived in secret in England, with rumors of rural villages holding stories about cats being the familiar of witches and warlocks.",
