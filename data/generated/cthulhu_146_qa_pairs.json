  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, vehicles can engage in combat using the regular combat rules, substituting the Drive Auto skill for both Fighting and Dodge skills. Vehicles can inflict damage on opponents, and the damage dealt is matched by the damage received by the vehicle, with the exception of a 1:1 ratio. Fighting maneuvers can be used to trip, push, or throw vehicles, and the success of these maneuvers can result in additional damage or movement action loss. The size difference between vehicles can affect the success of these maneuvers, with larger vehicles imposing greater penalties.",
