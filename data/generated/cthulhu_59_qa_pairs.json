  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes three skills in the context of a game or simulation: Pushed, Disguise, and Diving. Pushed involves defusing explosive devices or placing charges, with a high difficulty level and potentially chaotic consequences if failed. Disguise allows the user to change their appearance and voice to impersonate someone else, with varying levels of difficulty depending on the target's expertise. Diving, on the other hand, involves underwater navigation and equipment maintenance, with a focus on regular and hard difficulty levels.",
