  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game, investigators will encounter cosmic horrors and alien creatures that challenge their sanity, leading to potential madness. Sanity is a crucial aspect of the game, modeled after H.P. Lovecraft's fiction, and is used to determine an investigator's ability to withstand traumatic events. Investigators start with a set number of Sanity points, which can rise and fall during play, and losing too many points can lead to temporary, indefinite, or permanent insanity. The Keeper will test investigators' resiliency and emotional strength by calling for Sanity rolls, which can result in loss of Sanity points or temporary madness.",
