  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game \"Chases Investigators,\" players take on the role of investigators tasked with uncovering the truth behind the Cthulhu Mythos, a series of cosmic horrors that challenge their sanity. The game's mechanics are designed to simulate the psychological effects of encountering such horrors, with Sanity points serving as a measure of the investigator's mental resilience. Investigators can lose Sanity points, leading to temporary or indefinite insanity, and the Keeper will test their resiliency through Sanity rolls. The game's goal is to navigate the horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos while maintaining a grip on reality.",
