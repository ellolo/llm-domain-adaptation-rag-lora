  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nCyaegha, a massive black mass with a green-glowing eye, is worshiped by a cult in a small village in western Germany. The cult practices human sacrifice, but Cyaegha's primary concern is its release, which it cares little about. Cyaegha is a powerful entity with abilities that allow it to survey and attack its surroundings, and those who worship it can gain access to its dark powers. However, the cult's practices are said to be cursed, and those who worship Cyaegha can be possessed and converted to its cause, leading to a terrible doom.",
