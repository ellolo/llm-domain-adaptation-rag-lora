  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nWhen a character or vehicle encounters a hazard, such as a traffic jam or a pedestrian crossing, the Keeper must decide whether damage is inflicted and how much, using specific tables as a guide. The Keeper must also determine the consequences of failing to negotiate the hazard, which can include lost movement actions and potential damage. Hazards can be further distinguished from barriers, which block progress until successfully negotiated or removed, and may require specific skills to overcome. The Keeper must use their discretion to decide when a hazard constitutes a barrier and what the consequences of failing to overcome it are.",
