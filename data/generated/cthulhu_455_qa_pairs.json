  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe \"yellowjackets\" are a pair of thugs from Atlantic City who are hired by Charles Leiter's creditors to collect a debt of $11,000.

They can be played as a rival to the investigators, a source of physical action, or even an unlikely ally, depending on the Keeper's discretion.",
