  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a chase scenario, the Movement Over Distance (MOV) rating of a character is not a linear measure of speed, but rather an overall speed rating intended to represent their speed in a chase. When multiple characters are involved, each character makes a speed roll to establish their MOV rating, and the participants are then grouped into pursuers and fleeing characters based on their speed. The pursuers are placed in order of their MOV ratings, and the fleeing characters are placed in order of their MOV ratings relative to the slowest fleeing character. The positions of the characters, hazards, and movement actions are then determined, and the chase is resolved through a series of movement actions and potential hazards.",
