  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, investigators use perception skills to gather clues and solve mysteries. Perception skills include Spot Hidden, Listen, and Psychology, and a successful roll can reveal important information. To create an engaging game, the Keeper should provide a mix of obvious and obscure clues, allowing players to discover information on their own. This approach helps to avoid a single, crucial clue that might be missed, and provides a more dynamic and challenging experience for the players. The Keeper can use their discretion to reveal clues to specific players, depending on their involvement in the game.\n\nNow, I have a few questions:\n\n1. Can you elaborate on the difference between obvious and obscure clues? How do the Keepers decide which type of clue to provide?\n2. How do the Keepers ensure that the clues they provide are not too easy or too difficult for the players to discover?\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Idea roll\" mentioned in the text? How is it used in the game?",
