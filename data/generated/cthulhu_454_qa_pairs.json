  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nWick, a powerful ghoul, serves as a procurer of flesh and treasures, and a dealer in the spoils of the dead to humankind. He prefers to do dirty work at a distance, using his minions, Hector and Carla, to carry out tasks that are beneath him. Wick's motivations and actions are driven by his desire for the Witch Trial Papers, which he believes will grant him power and control. He is willing to use violence and intimidation to achieve his goals, and may even resort to ritualistic sacrifices to appease and bind a malevolent entity. Wick's character can be a useful contact for investigators, but also poses significant dangers and corruption.",
