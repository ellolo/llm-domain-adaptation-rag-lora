  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, gods and deities are depicted as having a significant advantage over mortals, with characteristics such as immense power, omniscience, and invulnerability. However, they are not omnipotent and can be physically assaulted and driven back, as seen in the story of Great Cthulhu. When facing a god, investigators are unlikely to be noticed or affected, and their chances of success are often negligible. Gods also have unique abilities, such as the ability to trap and dispose of mortals in their webs.",
