  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the Cthulhu Mythos skill is described as a way for characters to improvise magical effects, similar to spells, in the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game. When using this skill, the character must first state an aim, which the Keeper then considers and may suggest a lesser aim or block the proposal. The skill is resolved through a Cthulhu Mythos skill roll, with the Keeper determining the cost in Magic points and Sanity points, and the consequences of failure. The skill is not a fixed ability, but rather a dynamic process that requires rolling for every use.",
