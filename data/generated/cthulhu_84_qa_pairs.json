  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, the \"Transferable Benefit\" rule allows for the improvement of one specialization to have a positive impact on other closely related specialisms. When a character raises a specialization to 50% or over, all other related skill specializations are raised by 10 percentage points, but not higher than 50%. This rule can be applied multiple times, with the second application raising related specializations by 10 percentage points again, but not higher than 90%. This rule applies to various skills, including Fighting, Firearms, Languages, and Survival.",
