  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game system, investigators have a spending limit that they can exceed, but must then reduce their cash by the full amount spent. This system is intended to minimize bookkeeping, but can lead to uncertainty and requires the Keeper's intervention when necessary. The Keeper can also adjust the spending limit based on the investigator's assets and the cost of living in the location they are in. This allows for more flexibility in managing the investigator's finances, especially when traveling to areas with lower costs of living. The system also provides a way for investigators to access loans or convert assets into cash to cover expenses.",
