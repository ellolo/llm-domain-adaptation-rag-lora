  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a horror-themed game, careful consideration is required when creating and casting spells, as they can have a significant impact on gameplay. Key aspects of spellcasting include POW rolls to determine success, spell range, casting time, and costs, which can be altered based on the source of the spell and the scenario. The game master can also add personal touches to the spell, such as location, components, and ritual, to create a more immersive experience. Effective spellcasting requires a balance between the caster's POW and the target's POW, as well as consideration of the spell's effects on the caster's sanity.",
