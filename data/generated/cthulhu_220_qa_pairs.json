  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, the \"Idea roll\" is a mechanic that allows the Keeper to introduce new plot twists or complications, potentially throwing the game into chaos. If the players lose the Idea roll, the Keeper can restart the game, putting the investigators in a difficult situation. To avoid predetermining events, the Keeper should avoid scripting the arch-villain's fate and instead use the Luck pool to increase the villain's effectiveness. This allows the Keeper to maintain control over the game while still giving the players agency and direction. By using the Idea roll and Luck pool effectively, the Keeper can create a dynamic and unpredictable game world.",
