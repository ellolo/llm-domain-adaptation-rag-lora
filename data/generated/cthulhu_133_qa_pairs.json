  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIncorporating a movie-style knock-out rule into a game can be achieved by using blunt attacks to render an opponent unconscious, dealing only 1 hit point of damage. This rule can be applied to any opponent with a vulnerable spot, such as a human, deep one, ghoul, or shoggoth, but not a shoggoth. The Keeper can automatically declare a successful knock-out if the attacker sneaks up on the opponent or uses a surprise attack, as seen in the example of Harvey knocking out a security guard at the British Museum. Additionally, the game can include rules for spending Luck points to remain conscious, and for avoiding nothing happening when both sides fail their Fighting skill rolls.",
