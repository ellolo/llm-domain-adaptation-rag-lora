  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes the transformation of hybrids, which are half-human, half-deep ones, into Deep Ones, monstrous creatures that inhabit the sea. This transformation can occur in remote coastal villages or other locations, and typically takes place over several stages. During this process, hybrids may be lured to Deep One lairs or places of safety, where they can be supervised and schooled in their shared heritage. Those who complete the transformation gain special powers, including the ability to breathe underwater and cast spells. However, not all hybrids undergo the transformation, and some may even manifest in future descendants.",
