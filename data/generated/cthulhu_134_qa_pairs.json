  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nCombat in a role-playing game can be unpredictable, with various ways for characters to get hurt, including the opponent's fist, environmental hazards, and ranged attacks. To resolve combat, the Keeper can use one of three solutions: defaulting to the higher skill, allowing both sides to inflict damage, or using a CON roll to simulate uncertainty. Additionally, the Keeper can use techniques like suppressing fire to simulate panic and chaos in combat situations. This can include using suppressive fire to make a group of targets \"dive for cover\" and avoid return fire.",
