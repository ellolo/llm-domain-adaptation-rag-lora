  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nUbbo-Sathla is a powerful, formless god that dwells in a cold, dank cavern in Antarctica. It has the ability to regenerate its hit points and is immune to certain types of damage, but is vulnerable to magic and certain physical attacks.

The god's powers and abilities are described in detail, providing a rich and complex background for a fictional world.",
