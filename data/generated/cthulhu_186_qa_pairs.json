  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, the Mythos rating of a book is compared to the player's Cthulhu Mythos skill level. If the player's skill is below the book's rating, they gain Cthulhu Mythos points equal to the book's full study (CMF) number. If the player's skill is equal to or above the book's rating, they gain Cthulhu Mythos points equal to the book's initial reading (CMI) number. The player can then use these points to increase their Cthulhu Mythos skill, with each study taking progressively longer and with diminishing returns.",
