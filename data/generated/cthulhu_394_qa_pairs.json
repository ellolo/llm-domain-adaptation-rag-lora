  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nY'golonac and Yibb-Tstll are two malevolent deities in the Dreamlands universe of H.P. Lovecraft's works. Y'golonac is a minor god who feeds on the souls of those who are subtly evil, and can possess and transform individuals into his own form. To fight off a possession, a target must roll POW or less on a 1D100 each round, and if overpowered, they will lose INT and POW points until Y'golonac is forced away. Yibb-Tstll, on the other hand, is a deity who sees all time and space and is often approached by sorcerers seeking to use his servitors, but has no known cult.",
