  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, hazards can be used to add spice to a chase scene, slowing down characters and vehicles and potentially causing harm. The Keeper will present the hazard and allow each character to decide how to deal with it, using skills such as Climb, Swim, Dodge, STR, and Drive Auto to negotiate obstacles. If a character elects to take a cautious approach, they can spend movement actions to gain bonus dice on their skill roll, potentially avoiding damage or delay. A failed skill roll can result in damage or delay, and the Keeper will use tables to determine the extent of the damage.",
