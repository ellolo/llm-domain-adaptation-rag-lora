  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nDimensional Shamblers, also known as Elder Things, are entities capable of walking between planes and worlds, often serving a god or Great Old One. They possess unique abilities, including trans-dimensional travel, which allows them to leave one plane of existence and enter another, and spells, which they can cast with a high probability. These entities are described in the Lovecraftian mythos, specifically in the story \"At the Mountains of Madness,\" where they are referred to as the Old Ones. They are known to have created the shoggoths as slaves and have been driven back to Antarctica, but may still have colonies in the deepest waters.",
