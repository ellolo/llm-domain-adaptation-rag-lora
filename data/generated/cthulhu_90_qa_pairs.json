  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this game system, a \"pushed roll\" is a failed skill roll that grants the Keeper free rein over the outcome, allowing them to create more challenging and horror-themed consequences. When a player fails a pushed roll, the Keeper can impose additional consequences, such as damage, loss of equipment, or capture, to make the investigators' lives more difficult. This mechanic allows the Keeper to escalate the horror and tension in the game, while also giving players the opportunity to push back against the consequences of their failed rolls. The system also includes various consequences, such as setbacks, deals, and fainting, to create a Lovecraftian atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.",
