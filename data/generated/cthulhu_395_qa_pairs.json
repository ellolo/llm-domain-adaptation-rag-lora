  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nYibb-Tstll, a god with no known cult, is often approached by sorcerers seeking his use of nightgaunts or his beneficent touch. His touch can cause drastic losses, including the loss of sanity or death, and can also be beneficial. Yibb-Tstll's blood, known as \"The Black,\" can be summoned and takes independent action. In contrast, Yig, a North American deity, is worshiped by Plains tribes and voodoo doctors, and is associated with snakes, granting worshipers immunity from poisonous snakes and arcane rituals.",
