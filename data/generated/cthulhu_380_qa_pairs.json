Gla'aki's powers involve injecting a fluid into a victim's spine, which can either kill them, turn them into an undead slave, or leave them unharmed. The victim's fate depends on the damage caused by the spine and whether the fluid is injected before the spine is broken off. Gla'aki is also connected to Hastur and is said to be served by the byakhee, an interstellar flying race.",
