  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, combat is resolved through a sequence of skill rolls, with the goal of inflicting physical harm. To make combat more dynamic, players are encouraged to improvise using everyday objects as improvised weapons. The Keeper can use a Luck roll to determine the availability of these objects, and combat maneuvers can be resolved with a combination of skill rolls, size, and strength. The game also emphasizes the importance of comparing the builds of the combatants to gauge the relative might of the opponents.",
