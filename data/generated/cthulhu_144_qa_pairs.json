  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a chase scenario, the Keeper must decide how to handle hazards and barriers, which can slow or stop the character or vehicle. Hazards can cause damage, while barriers block progress until they are successfully negotiated or removed. The Keeper must use Table III: Other Forms of Damage or Table VI: Vehicular Collisions to determine the extent of damage, and roll 1D3 for lost movement actions if a hazard is failed. Barriers, on the other hand, can be overcome with specific skills such as Jump, STR, or Locksmith.",
