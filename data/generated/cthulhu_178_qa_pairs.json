  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game Call of Cthulhu, investigators can be institutionalized if they are deemed a danger to themselves or others due to mental health issues. The duration of institutionalization varies by state, but typically ranges from 60 to 180 days. To recover from insanity, investigators can receive rewards such as Keeper awards, increasing skills to 90%, or psychotherapy, which can restore Sanity points. However, psychoanalysis is not a cure-all and can have negative consequences if the investigator's mental state is too severe.",
