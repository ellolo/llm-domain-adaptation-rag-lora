  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the context of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, the \"Dark Young\" are enormous, writhing, tentacled creatures that serve as avatars of the Great Old One Shub-Niggurath. These creatures are typically 12-20 feet tall, with a tree-like silhouette, and are capable of draining the strength of their victims. They are often found in areas where Shub-Niggurath is worshiped and are known to act as proxies for their mother, accepting sacrifices and spreading her faith. The Dark Young possess unique abilities, including the ability to use their tentacles to grab and drain victims, and are feared for their ability to wreak havoc on the world.",
