  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes two fictional creatures from the Lovecraftian universe: the Servants of Gla'aki, undead slaves created by the Great Old One Gla'aki, and the Gnoph-Keh, a mysterious, hairy, and adaptable being associated with Ithaqua. The Servants of Gla'aki are created from Gla'aki's spines and share his memories, but they decay and become vulnerable to intense light. They have limited magical abilities and are typically armed with a sickle, while the Gnoph-Keh has the power to summon a blizzard, restricting visibility and costing it a magic point per hour. Both creatures have unique characteristics and abilities that make them formidable opponents in a Lovecraftian setting.",
