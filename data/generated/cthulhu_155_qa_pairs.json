  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the rules for vehicle chases are outlined, including the potential for explosions, damage, and accidents. The Keeper determines the outcome of the chase, using a combination of Luck rolls and skill checks to navigate hazards. The document also introduces the concept of MOV (Movement Rate) ratings, which measure relative speeds and affect the outcome of chases. Additionally, the rules for chases in different environments, such as air and sea, are discussed. The document provides guidelines for creating new hazards and barriers in these environments.",
