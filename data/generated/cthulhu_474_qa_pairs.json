  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, investigators can lose sanity due to terrifying experiences, which can lead to temporary, indefinite, or permanent insanity. Sanity points, which start equal to the investigator's POW, can fluctuate and decline or increase, but do not regenerate. Investigators can use skills and characteristics to overcome challenges, with success determined by a 1D100 roll. The game also includes various mechanics, such as surprise attacks, unconsciousness, and the use of mythos tomes, which can be used to enhance gameplay.",
