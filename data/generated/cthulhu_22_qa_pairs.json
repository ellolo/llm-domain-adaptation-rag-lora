  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Great Old Ones are a group of powerful, supernatural alien beings in the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe created by H.P. Lovecraft. Each Great Old One is independent and has unique abilities, with some being temporarily imprisoned and others roaming freely across the Earth. Cthulhu, the most famous Great Old One, is said to be the most important on Earth, and is worshiped by humans more than the others combined. However, the designers of the current edition have omitted certain elements from the original concept, including the \"war in heaven\" between the Great Old Ones and the Elder Gods, and the connections between the Great Old Ones and the elements of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air.",
