  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, players can develop skills in various scientific disciplines, such as Astronomy, Biology, Botany, and Chemistry. These skills, known as \"specializations,\" allow characters to conduct experiments, analyze data, and make informed decisions in their investigations. The difficulty of these tasks is determined by a \"pushed\" roll, which can result in unexpected consequences, such as catastrophic experiments or unintended discoveries. Characters can also develop \"allied\" specialties, which can be used as a backup or to overcome specific challenges.",
