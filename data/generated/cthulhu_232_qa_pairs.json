  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the context of the Call of Cthulhu game, the Keeper's role is to create a terrifying experience for the investigators, using a combination of clues and monster encounters to deduce the identity or purpose of the monsters. The Keeper should aim to provide players with opportunities to avoid death, but not necessarily to make the game too easy. The monsters presented in the game, particularly those of lesser intelligence, should be unpredictable and terrifying, while those of higher intelligence should be more cunning and less willing to engage in combat. The Keeper's decisions can greatly impact the game's balance and outcome, and should be made with the goal of creating a challenging and immersive experience for the players.",
