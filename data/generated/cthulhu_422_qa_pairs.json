  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, investigators are tasked with tracking down two kidnappers, Sidney Harris and Eugene Clayton, who have escaped into a forest. To progress, the investigators must make tracking rolls to follow the kidnappers' trail, which may be hazardous and slow. The investigators will encounter various obstacles, such as disturbed foliage and bloodstains, which they must navigate through. Successful tracking rolls will provide advantages, while failed rolls may result in exhaustion or other negative outcomes. The investigators must ultimately find the kidnappers, who are likely to be hiding in the forest.",
