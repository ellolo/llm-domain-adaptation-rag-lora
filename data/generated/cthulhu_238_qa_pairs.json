  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a horror game like Call of Cthulhu, the death of an investigator can be a significant event, but it's not always necessary to deal out death. Instead, players can be encouraged to form an attachment to their investigators, and the death of an investigator can be a heroic or meaningful event. To make the game more enjoyable, the Keeper can use epilogues to wrap up the story and provide a sense of closure for each player's investigator. Additionally, starting with a mysterious event, devising an alternate history, or using a Mythos entity as inspiration can create a unique and engaging scenario.",
