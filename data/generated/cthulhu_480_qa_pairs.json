  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the 7th Edition of Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper has new options for handling social interactions, including the ability to \"push\" skill rolls, which can lead to more complex consequences. When a player attempts to intimidate or charm someone, the Keeper can adjust the difficulty level based on the situation, and can also use alternative skills such as Intimidate or Charm. The Keeper should also consider the characteristic values of the characters involved and use the new guidelines for characteristic rolls. Additionally, the Keeper can use the new \"pushing\" skill rolls to create more complex consequences, rather than immediately failing a skill roll.",
