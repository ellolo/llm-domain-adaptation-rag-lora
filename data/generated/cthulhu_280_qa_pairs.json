  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, the Keeper must create motivation for a deity's behavior, often due to hunger. To call a deity, specific conditions and rituals must be met, varying by deity. For example, to call Azathoth, the spell can be cast outside at night with no special preparations, while to call Hastur, nine large stone blocks must be arranged in a V-pattern and cleared nights with Aldebaran above the horizon. Each deity has unique requirements and rituals, adding to the mystery and danger of summoning them.",
