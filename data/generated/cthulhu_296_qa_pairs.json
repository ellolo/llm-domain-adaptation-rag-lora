  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes two spells in the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game: Fist of Yog-Sothoth and Green Decay. Fist of Yog-Sothoth is a powerful spell that deals massive damage to a target, while Green Decay is a curse that slowly turns a victim into a green mold over the course of seven days. Both spells require significant magical energy and have specific requirements for casting, including the use of magic points, POW, and Sanity points. The spells are considered to be of dark and malevolent nature, fitting for the Lovecraftian horror theme of the game.",
