  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes three spells in the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game: \"The Rite of Knowledge Long Lost\", \"Song of Hastur\", and \"The King's Cry\". These spells involve the manipulation of powerful energies and the use of magical incantations to inflict harm or terror on victims. The spells have specific requirements, such as the need for a successful POW roll or the alignment of celestial bodies, and can have varying effects on the victim, including physical damage, mental terror, or even transformation into a monstrous creature. The spells also have alternative names and deeper versions, which offer additional complexity and strategy for the game.",
