  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop game, combat is resolved through a combination of skill rolls, dice rolls, and the attacker's and defender's abilities. Ranged and thrown attacks are treated similarly to firearms, with the attacker needing to be within a certain distance of the defender to engage. Armor can reduce damage inflicted, but not magical attacks, and surprise attacks can automatically hit or gain a bonus die. Additionally, when a character is outnumbered, they gain a bonus die on subsequent attacks, and characters can dodge or fight back multiple times before the bonus die is applied.",
