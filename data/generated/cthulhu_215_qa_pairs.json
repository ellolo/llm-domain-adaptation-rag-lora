  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a role-playing game, the Keeper (game moderator) must balance the difficulty level of challenges to keep the game engaging and fun for the players. The Keeper's decisions on difficulty level, such as raising it to Extreme for a cultist with low Intimidate and Psychology skills, can greatly impact the game's outcome. The Keeper must also consider the emotional and psychological impact of violent or traumatic events on the players, potentially requiring Sanity rolls to reflect the characters' mental state. Effective pacing is crucial to keep the game moving and engaging, with the Keeper striking a balance between action, discussion, and drama.",
