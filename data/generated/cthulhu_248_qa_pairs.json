  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nTo effectively use a published scenario in a game, such as Call of Cthulhu, it's essential to approach it with a clear understanding of its contents. The first step is to read the scenario thoroughly, gaining an overview of the chapters and contents, and then to read it again, taking notes on the essential details. This process helps to distill the scenario into a set of Keeper's notes, allowing you to feel ownership of the scenario and create new stories with your players. By identifying and noting down essential elements, you can effectively run the game in your own way, while still respecting the original scenario.",
