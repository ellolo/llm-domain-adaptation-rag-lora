  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nCthulhu, a monstrous entity from H.P. Lovecraft's works, is a powerful being that can incinerate a 20-yard radius area with fire, causing significant damage to those within its reach. To combat Cthulhu, targets must make an Extreme CON roll, which can result in hit point loss or incineration. Cthulhu's physical form is highly adaptable, allowing it to warp and modify its body to suit its surroundings, but its overall shape remains recognizable as a caricature of the creature. Those who hear Cthulhu's call, often through dreams or artistic inspirations, may be driven to madness or creative works that reflect the darkness of the entity's influence.",
