  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, First Aid and Medicine skills are used to treat injuries and stabilize dying characters. First Aid can be attempted once to grant 1 hit point recovery, while Medicine can be used to recover more hit points, but with increased difficulty if not performed on the same day. A dying character must be stabilized with First Aid, followed by Medicine, and then a recovery roll is made after a week of rest. The character's condition can deteriorate if they fail to recover, requiring further treatment.",
