  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, the Keeper's role is to guide the players through a terrifying experience, pushing them into situations that will lead to madness and irrational behavior. The Keeper uses various techniques, such as providing warnings and hints, to create a sense of foreboding and danger. The goal is to create a sense of uncertainty and unease, blurring the lines between reality and delusions, and ultimately driving the players' characters to the brink of madness. By doing so, the Keeper gains control over the investigator, leading to a bout of madness or even permanent insanity. The Keeper's approach is to create a sense of psychological horror, rather than relying solely on supernatural or paranormal elements.",
