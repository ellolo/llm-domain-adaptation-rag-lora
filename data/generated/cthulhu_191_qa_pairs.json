  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, magic casting can have unintended consequences, including physical damage and Sanity point loss. When a spell is cast, the Keeper can use a set of rules to determine the physical harm inflicted on the caster, such as damage to hit points or physical injuries. Additionally, the casting of a spell can also have a psychological impact, potentially leading to Sanity point loss and even insanity. The Keeper can use these rules to create a more immersive and realistic experience for the players.",
