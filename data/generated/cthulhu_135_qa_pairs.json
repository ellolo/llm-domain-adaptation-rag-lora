  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, investigators and non-player characters can use various tactics to avoid or mitigate damage from firearms. The Keeper can use random rolls or Luck rolls to determine the effectiveness of these tactics, such as diving for cover, bracing a firearm, or wearing armor. Armor ratings can reduce damage from shotgun attacks, and specific armor can offer protection to specific body parts. Additionally, telescopic sights and bracing a firearm can increase the effective range of a weapon.",
