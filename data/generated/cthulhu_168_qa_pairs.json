  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the investigators' sanity is tested through various scenarios, resulting in different outcomes. These outcomes, known as \"Bouts of Madness,\" can range from amnesia to violence, and may involve significant changes to the investigator's behavior, memories, or physical state. The Keeper can choose from a list of sample phobias or manias, which can be added to the investigator's backstory, to create a unique and unpredictable experience for the player. The Bouts of Madness can be triggered by a roll of a penalty die, and the outcome is determined by the Keeper's discretion.",
