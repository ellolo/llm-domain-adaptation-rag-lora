  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Necronomicon is a fictional grimoire in the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe created by H.P. Lovecraft. The book is said to contain deep magic and knowledge related to the Cthulhu Mythos, including spells, incantations, and descriptions of various Mythos entities. There are several versions of the Necronomicon, including the original Kitab Al Azif written by Abdul Al-Hazred around 730 A.D., and later translations by Olaus Wormius, Dr. John Dee, and Baron Frederic. Each version is said to have a different level of sanity loss and Mythos rating, with the original Kitab Al Azif being the most powerful and potentially insane-inducing.",
