  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, learning and casting spells is a crucial aspect of gameplay. To learn a spell, a character must attempt a Hard INT roll, which can be pushed with justification, but may result in Sanity point loss and strange magical effects. Once a spell is learned, it can be taught to others, and characters can also learn spells from Mythos entities through disturbing and alienating experiences. Casting spells requires a successful casting roll, Magic points, and physical components, and can result in Sanity point loss and other consequences. The timing and difficulty of casting spells vary depending on the spell and the character's abilities.",
