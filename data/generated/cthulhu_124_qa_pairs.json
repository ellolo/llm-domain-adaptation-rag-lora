  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, firearms combat is governed by specific rules. When firing at a target, the attacker rolls damage for half of the shots fired, subtracting any armor from each shot. The difficulty level of the shot affects the outcome, with Extreme success guaranteeing a hit and impale, while Regular and Hard success result in a hit and partial damage. The game also allows for partial volleys, where the attacker fires fewer shots at multiple targets, to conserve ammunition and manage the difficulty level of the shot.",
