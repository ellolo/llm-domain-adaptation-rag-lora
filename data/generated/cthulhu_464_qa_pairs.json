  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, the investigators must deal with the consequences of handling the Witch Trial Papers, which contain the Horror, a malevolent entity that can manifest and wreak havoc. The investigators can choose to destroy the illustrated portion of the papers, which is the most effective way to stop the Horror, or use their Cthulhu Mythos skill to dispel it. Alternatively, they can hand the papers over to Dean Fallon or another interested party, which may lead to financial rewards but also risks the Horror's manifestation. The outcome of the scenario depends on the investigators' actions and the Keeper's discretion.",
