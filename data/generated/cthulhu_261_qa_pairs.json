  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Necronomicon, a dark and powerful book, is known to exist in only five copies today, with the majority being Latin versions printed in 17th-century Spain and 16th-century Germany. These copies are highly valued and few can afford to obtain them, making them inaccessible to the general public. The existing copies are held in various institutions, including the British Museum, the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, and the Miskatonic University Library, and are often fragile and rare. The book's history is shrouded in mystery, with some copies believed to have been lost or destroyed over time.",
