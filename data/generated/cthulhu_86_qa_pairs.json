  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper should clearly state a player's goal before determining the difficulty level for skill rolls. The difficulty level is determined by the Keeper, who considers the complexity of the goal and the skills involved, and can range from Regular to Extreme. The Keeper uses the following guidelines to set difficulty levels: Regular (average challenge), Hard (professional-level challenge), and Extreme (expert-level challenge). The Keeper also considers the skills and characteristics of the opponent when setting difficulty levels, and can adjust the difficulty level accordingly.",
