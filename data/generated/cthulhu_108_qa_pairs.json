  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a combat scenario, players take turns acting and speaking in rounds, with each player having a chance to complete at least one action. The order of attack is determined by ranking characters' Dexterity (DEX) from highest to lowest, with ties resolved by combat skill. In a one-on-one fist fight, melee attacks are resolved using opposed skill rolls, with characters choosing to either dodge or fight back. The Brawling skill is used for melee attacks, while the Dodge skill is used to avoid being hit. This system allows for a flexible and dynamic combat experience.",
