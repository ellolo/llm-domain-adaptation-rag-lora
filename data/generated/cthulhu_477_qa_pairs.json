  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the 7th Edition of a game, skills are now more flexible and can be distributed as the player sees fit. The Keeper may enforce a cap of 75% on starting skills, and some points can be transferred between skills to balance an investigator or non-player character (NPC). Combat skills, such as Fighting (Brawl), have been amalgamated into a single skill, and basic weapons like clubs and knives are now included in this skill. Additionally, the rules for converting NPCs, gods, beasts, and monsters have been updated, and characteristics and skills for these entities are now simplified for setting difficulty levels.",
