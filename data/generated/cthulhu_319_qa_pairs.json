  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, investigators can face various monsters from Lovecraft's Mythos, some of which can be defeated in combat, while others require fleeing or hiding to survive. These Mythos entities, such as Deep Ones, Mi-Go, and Ghouls, are designed to be formidable and unpredictable, making them challenging to defeat. To accurately portray these monsters, it's essential to remember that their goals, knowledge, and abilities are often difficult to fathom, and their mere presence can draw madness upon investigators. Pronunciation guides for Mythos names are also provided to help players accurately represent these alien entities.",
