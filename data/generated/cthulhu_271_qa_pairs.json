  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, cultists who achieve a paradigm shift and transcend insanity can access deeper levels of magic, known as \"deeper magic,\" which can be discovered through spellcasting. When an investigator casts a spell and is insane, they can roll a 1D100 and compare the result to their Cthulhu Mythos skill to determine if they have successfully plumbed the deeper magic. Deeper magic can be used by all Mythos entities and cultists with zero Sanity points, and can be altered by the Keeper to create new and exciting effects. The Keeper should plan ahead when introducing spells that might fall into the hands of investigators, and consider the potential deeper magical effects.",
