Hunting Horrors are massive, forty-foot-long creatures that can be summoned to seek out blood and lives, and are repelled by daylight. Lloigor, on the other hand, are vortices of power that exist as invisible, intangible entities, and can take on monstrous, reptilian forms when needed. They possess telekinetic abilities and are masters of manipulating reality, but their minds are shrouded in pessimism and are incomprehensible to humans.",
