  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe investigators are investigating the mysterious death of Professor Leiter, whose body has been found with severe injuries, including a massive heart attack, violent muscular spasms, and thermal damage to his optic tissues. Autopsy results suggest that the cause of death is unknown and cannot be explained by any outside cause. Emilia Court, a faculty member and Leiter's assistant, is a key witness to the investigation, but her motives and true intentions are unclear, and she may be seeking to discredit Leiter's colleagues, including Anthony Flinders and Roach. The investigators may need to use Charm rolls to persuade Court to assist them, and she may have secrets of her own, including her independently wealthy background and her goal of becoming a professor.",
