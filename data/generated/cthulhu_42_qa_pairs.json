These traits can be chosen from a list of 10 options, including Generous, Good with Animals, Dreamer, Hedonist, Gambler, Good Cook, Ladies' Man, Loyal, Good Reputation, and Ambitious. The investigator's key background connection is also chosen, which can provide meaning to their life and aid in regaining sanity points. The Keeper has the freedom to modify or destroy the key connection, but the investigator must be given the opportunity to save it through a dice roll.",
