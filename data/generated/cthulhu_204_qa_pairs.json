  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this game, the Keeper (game moderator) plays the role of non-player characters, including NPCs like a maid or a barkeep.

The Keeper's goal is to create a immersive experience for the players, who should model their performances on the Keeper's example.",
