  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document appears to be a list of recommended texts for a Keeper in a Cthulhu Mythos setting, specifically those related to the worship of Cthulhu and other Outer Gods. The texts include \"Thaumaturgical Prodigies In The New-England Canaan\", \"True Magick\", and \"Zanthu Tablets\", which are said to contain information on summoning and binding spirits, as well as the worship of various deities. Reading these texts is said to result in a loss of sanity, with varying degrees of severity depending on the text and the individual Keeper. The document also notes that reading occult books can add to the Occult skill, but does not incur a sanity cost.",
