  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Call of Cthulhu game system uses a skill-based system to resolve conflicts and challenges. To make a skill roll, a player must state a goal, determine the difficulty level, and roll dice, with the goal of achieving a critical success (01) or avoiding a fumble (96-100). The difficulty level is determined by the opposing skill or characteristic, with regular, hard, and extreme difficulties ranging from 50 to 90 and above, respectively. Opposed rolls are used when two players are opposing each other, with the winner determined by the best level of success.",
