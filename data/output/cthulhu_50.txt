 of equal 
to or below one-fifth of the skill value) be called for—only 
in  the  most  extreme  and  dire  situations.  Sometimes  this 
may  be  simply  that  the  performance  of  the  skill  is  greatly 
hindered, such as when being shot at or pursued, or when 
conditions are uniquely appalling.

Some examples of where an Extreme difficulty might be 

called for include:

Demolitions:  to  defuse  an  explosive  device  of  a  radically 
different design to any seen before, perhaps of futuristic or 
alien origin.

Electrical Repair: working on futuristic or alien technology 
that uses a form of electronics.

Listen:  Eavesdropping  on  a  quiet  conversation  in  an  ex-
tremely noisy environment.

Locksmith: Opening a high security lock with only a piece 
of wire (i.e. no tools); crack open the most secure of bank 
vaults.

Medicine: Diagnosis and treatment of strange, new, or alien 
medical ailments.

Psychology:  Read  someone’s  intent  or  determine  that  a 
person is lying if their relevant opposing skill (Intimidate, 
Fast Talk, Persuade, or Charm) is 90% or above.
