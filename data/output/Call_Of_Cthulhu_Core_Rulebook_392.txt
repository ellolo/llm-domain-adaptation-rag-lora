ATTACKS 
Attacks per round: 1
Fighting attacks: Sticky filaments and other appendages attempt 

to draw the target close enough so it can be digested.

Swallow  (mnvr):  Attacks  with  sticky  filaments,  pseudopods,  or 
with gelatinous tentacles. Whatever the attack, a success draws 
the target into the spawn’s body, where it is digested at the rate 
of  1D6  hit  points  per  round.  Once  swallowed,  no  action  is 
possible, though friends may attempt to free the victim.

Ubbo-Sathla
There, in the gray beginning of Earth, the formless mass that 
was Ubbo-Sathla reposed amid the slime and the vapors. 
Headless, without organs or members, it sloughed off from 
its oozy sides, in a slow, ceaseless wave, the amoebic forms 
that were the archetypes of earthly life. About it there lay the 
mighty tablets of star-quarried stone that were writ with the 
inconceivable wisdom of the premundane gods.

—Clark Ashton Smith, Ubbo-Sathla

This god dwells in a cold, dank cavern, and never leaves its 
lair  unless  called  or  disturbed.  The  grotto  can  be  entered

entrances  from  the
