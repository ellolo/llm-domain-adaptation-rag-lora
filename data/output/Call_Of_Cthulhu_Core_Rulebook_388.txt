 and stand-ins, the dark young, may 
represent the aid she grants worshipers.

Summoned,  Shub-Niggurath  attacks  non-worshipers 

present.

She is often summoned specifically to accept sacrifices. 
Shub-Niggurath can be dismissed by those who know her 
summoning  spell  and  it  is  possible  to  hurt  her  enough  to 
make her leave.

ATTACKS 
Attacks per round: 1
Fighting  attacks:  Shub-Niggurath  has  a  multitude  of  tentacles, 

which flail around and may hit opponents.

Seize  (mnvr):  Shub-Niggurath  has  dozens  of  tentacles,  but  can 
only seize one victim in a round. With a successful catch, the 
investigator is seized and whipped to the goddess’ body to be 
drained  of  body  fluids  by  one  of  her  many  mouths,  the  bite 
permanently draining 3D10 STR from the victim per round.
While being drained, the victim is held absolutely helplessly, and 
may not cast spells, expend magic points, or perform any act 
whatsoever except to writhe in pain and scream.

In  battle  against  more  powerful  beings,  Shub-Niggurath  still 
attacks  with  one  tentacle  per  opponent,  but  after  a  tentacle 
strikes  it  holds  on,  and  a  second  tentacle  attacks,  and  so  on. 
Each  additional  successful  attack  permits  a  new  mouth  to 
begin to drain her gigantic victim.

Trample: Once per round, Shub-Niggurath may trample beings of 
SIZ 300 or less. The trample attack is effective against all such 
beings in her path, which averages 10-20 yards across.

Rhan-Tegoth’s CON by 5, to a maximum of 800 CON. Ex-
cess points are lost. Unfed, Rhan-Tegoth loses 1D100 CON 
each day until reaching 300, and then re-enters hibernation.
A sacrifice fully drained by Rhan-Tegoth is left flattened 
and  riddled  with  hundreds  of  tiny  puncture  wounds.  The 
blood and body fluids sucked out, only the crushed shell of 
the corpse remains. Seeing such a corpse costs 1/1D6 Sanity 
points.
