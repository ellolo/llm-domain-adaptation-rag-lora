imals  listed  below  are  those  that  feature  as  foes  in 
stories of the horror genre (think of Hitchcock’s The 
Birds) or those that might be utilized by the investi-
gators (such as horses as mounts).

Bat, Large
The giant fruit bat of Central America congregates in doz-
ens or hundreds. The smaller bats common to the United 
States  gather  in  enormous  cavern-based  flocks  of 
up to 50,000 individuals. Bats worldwide are under 
severe environmental attack from humans.

Bird
Common birds such as the magpie, crow, and jackdaw offer 
no threat to humans normally, however in the horror genre 
these  creatures  sometimes  turn  into  foes.  Use  the  values 
given for bats for an individual smaller bird.

Larger  birds  may  pose  possible  threats  if  so  inclined. 
The statistics below provide for a giant eagle or any other 
large bird. Only the largest birds will attack humans, though 
vultures will attack helpless prey of any sort. All birds have 
the special ability to cut an attacker’s chance to hit in half 
(one penalty die to hit) while they are flying.

Larger birds live in the higher hills and mountains, which 
offer safe nesting sites and reliable updrafts for soaring. They 
perch among pinnacles or on rocky ledges, or even in trees 
that have grown close enough to support the considerable 

weight of up to a half-dozen large birds and their nest. The 
range  of  such  birds  is  effectively  the  western  hemisphere, 
but no reason exists that a Keeper cannot say, “A giant bird 
is diving at you” anywhere this side of Antarctica, where the 
giant birds only walk.
