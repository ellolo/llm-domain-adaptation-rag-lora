 cult  of  Hastur  is  moderately  common  on  Earth,  and 
the abominable tcho-tcho peoples are reputedly among his 
worshipers, as are the Brothers of the Yellow Sign. Hastur’s 
cult  is  particularly  loathsome,  and  is  more  widely  known 
of than it is belonged to. Worshipers refer to Hastur as "He 
Who Is Not to Be Named." This may be a misapprehension, 
stemming from his title, The Unspeakable.

Other Characteristics
Hastur is summonable only at night. When Hastur is pres-
ent, each round three individuals within 20 yards of the hor-
ror  must  successfully  Dodge  or  be  grasped  by  Hastur  and 
destroyed on the following round. Hastur does not normally 
attack friends or worshipers. He must always leave that por-
tion of the Earth where Aldebaran is below the horizon.

Ithaqua
The stars had been blotted out…the great cloud which had 
obscured the sky looked curiously like the outline of a great 
man. And…where the top of the “cloud” must have been, 
where the head of the thing should have been, there were two 
gleaming stars, visible despite the shadow, two gleaming stars, 
burning bright—like eyes!

Call of CthulhuIthaqua

Ithaqua  is  reported  from  the  Arctic  and 
sub-Arctic,  where  Native  Americans 
encountered  him.  He  is  known  to  stalk 
the  wastes, 
tracking  down  hapless 
travelers  and  carrying  them  off.  Such 
unfortunates  are  sometimes 
found 
alive, and they linger living for a while, 
unable to explain what has happened 
to them. Most are found dead weeks 
or months later, buried partway as if 
dropped from a height, frozen solid 
in  positions  of  great  agony,  and 
missing random body parts.

Cult
Ithaqua has a minimal cult, though 
many fear him in the far north. The 
inhabitants  of  Siberia  and  Alaska 
may leave sacrifices to keep the Wen-
digo  from  haunting  their  camps, 
but  organized  worship  seems  to 
be rare. Ithaqua is more widely 
worshiped  on  the  faraway 

world of Borea.
