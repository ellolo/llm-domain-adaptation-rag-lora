Foreword

What has risen may sink, and what is sunk may rise… Cthulhu still lives. 

—H. P . Lovecraft

My own introduction to H. P. Lovecraft was as a child, when I found a tattered book of stories, printed 
long before I was born. I read that book in bed that night, and became entranced forever. If you, too, love 
Lovecraft’s stories, you can now experience the Cthulhu Mythos in a whole new way. 

I’ve been a game designer more than 30 years, and a Lovecraft fan far longer. I’ve been an author, a 
college professor, and even executive producer on a movie. You’ve probably heard of some of the games 
I helped to create, and might even have played them. In the video game field, I’m probably best known 
for the strategy games I worked on. But I am most proud of how I helped create the horror roleplaying 
genre, as original author/developer of the Call of Cthulhu game way back in 1980.

My other ventures have, at times, been successful. Some of the computer games I helped to develop 
sold millions of copies. But when I am invited to a game convention as a guest, or when a fan offers to 
buy me a drink, or asks for an autograph, or any of the perks that my modest fame has accumulated, it is 
always for Call of Cthulhu, never one of my other games. Call of Cthulhu is beloved in a way nothing else 
has been—and this is of course due mostly to the power of Lovecraft’s world, and Chaosium’s dedication 
in bringing it forth to you, my friends. 

Chaosium, through Call of Cthulhu, popularized the terrifying universe of H. P. Lovecraft in gaming 
and made Cthulhu a household word. Now, Chaosium has put together a team of experienced game 
professionals with decades of experience. In this 7th edition, Chaosium has managed once again a suc-
cessful combination of roleplaying adventure with Lovecraftian horror, both of which are dear to my 
heart. They are, and were, the right team for this topic. 

Hardcore fans will be thrilled to hear that the new edition has lost nothing in the transition, and 
teems  with  terror,  horror,  and  ways  to  introduce  you  and  your  friends  to  the  dread  world  that  H.  P. 
Lovecraft and his friends constructed.

Chapter One
Introduction

The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of 
the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid 
island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was 
not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining 
in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the 
piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying 
vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall 
either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace 
and safety of a new dark age...

—H.P. Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu"

Welcome to 
Call of Cthulhu! 

all of Cthulhu is a game full of secrets, myster-
ies and horror. Playing the role of a steadfast 
investigator,  you  will  travel  to  strange  and 
dangerous  places,  uncover  foul  plots  and 
stand against the terrors of the night. You will 
encounter  sanity-blasting  entities,  monsters  and  insane 
cultists. Within strange and forgotten tomes of lore you will 
find secrets that man was not meant to know. 

You and your companions may very well decide the fate 

of the world.

Call  of  Cthulhu  is  a  horror-themed  roleplaying  game 
based on the writings of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft 
penned  a  tremendous  body  of  work  during  the  1920s  and 
1930s, concerning both horrors from beyond and from with-
in. Following his death in 1937, Lovecraft’s stories of cosmic 
horror  have  grown  in  reputation  and  stature,  and  today  he 
is recognized as a major American horror story writer of the 
twentieth  century,  influencing  numerous  authors  and  film 
directors,  and  amassing  a  huge  following  of  devoted  fans. 
Indeed,  Lovecraft  himself  could  now  be  considered  a  cult 
figure in his own right. Lovecraft’s fiction ranges from science 
fiction  to  gothic  horror  and  into  nihilistic  cosmic  terror—
perfect material on which to base a roleplaying game.

Lovecraft’s  most  famous  invention  has  become  known 
as the Cthulhu Mythos, a series of stories sharing common 
plot elements, such as certain mythical books of arcane lore 
and  alien  godlike  entities.  The  Cthulhu  Mythos  fired  the 
imagination of other authors, mostly protégés and friends 
of  Lovecraft,  and  soon  they  were  adding  to  this  complex 
mythology, further advancing its concepts and constituent 
parts.  Today, “Cthulhu”  stories  are  still  being  written  (and 
filmed) by the heirs to Lovecraft’s literary legacy.

An Overview of the Game
The aim of playing Call of Cthulhu is to have fun with your 
friends as you explore and create a Lovecraftian story. One 
player takes the role of game moderator, known as the Keep-
er of Arcane Lore (“Keeper” for short), and his or her role 
within the rules is to run the game for the rest of the players. 
The rest of the players take the part of intrepid Investigators 
of  the  Unknown  (“investigators”),  attempting  to  seek  out, 
understand and eventually confront the horrors, mysteries 
and secrets of the Cthulhu Mythos. 

The Keeper picks a story to run. These stories are known 
as “scenarios”, and you will find two at the back of this book. 
A scenario provides the Keeper with the structure of a story 
for him or her to present to the players. The Keeper’s role 
is a little like that of a director making a film in which the 
actors don’t know how the story will develop. To extend that 
analogy, the players are like actors who have the freedom to 
improvise their own scripts. 

The  investigators  need  not  be  anything  at  all  like  the 
people  who  play  them.  Indeed,  it  is  often  more  rewarding 
and enjoyable for players to create characters entirely unlike 
themselves: tough private eyes, rude taxi drivers, or sinisterly 
genteel occultists. 

Most of the play is a verbal exchange. The Keeper sets the 
scene, describing the environment, the individuals, and en-
counters to the players. The players tell the Keeper what they 
intend their investigators to do. The Keeper then tells them 
whether they can do it and, if not, what happens instead. In 
play the game takes the form of a group conversation with 
many twists and turns and fun on the way.

The game rules use dice to determine if an action suc-
ceeds or fails when a dramatic “conflict” presents itself; for 
example, whether your investigators are able to leap out of 
the way of a giant statue that is about to crash down upon 
their heads! The rules describe how to decide the outcome 
of such conflicts. 

In Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper has the responsibility of 
preparing scenarios and running the game without bias. It 
is  the  Keeper’s  duty  to  make  the  investigators’  opposition 
smart and mean.

Cooperation & Competition
Gaming is a social pastime. If you want to use your imag-
ination alone, you could simply read a book. However, be 
warned!  When  a  number  of  people  get  together  coopera-
tively, they build a communal fantasy far more interesting 
and  imaginative  than  a  single  person  can—and  the  joint 
effort results in an extremely fun and satisfying experience 
for all involved. Together you create and develop a story in 
which each of your investigators plays a leading role.

Whether  or  not  investigators  cooperate,  the  players 
should.  Investigators  may  be  played  as  nice  people,  as 
devious  brutes,  or  however  the  players  wish.  Most  of  the 
entertainment of the game can be found in the ingenuity of 
players’ roleplaying and in-character conversations, as well 
as the unforeseeably scary or amusing directions the story 
will take.

Working cooperatively together, the players and Keeper 
build an enjoyable and understandable “world” in which to 
play. The rewards of cooperation are great. Remember, the 
object of all of this is to have fun!

Winners and Losers
In  Call  of  Cthulhu,  there  are  no  winners  and  losers  in  the 
standard competitive sense. Play is usually cooperative. The 
participants work together to attain a common goal—usual-
ly to discover and foil some nefarious plot being perpetrated 
by  the  minions  of  some  dark  cult  or  secret  society.  The 
opposition that the investigators face will often be an alien 
or hostile situation—controlled by an impartial Keeper, not 
another player. 

Winning  in  such  a  situation  depends  on  whether  the 
investigators succeed in their goal. Losing is what happens if 
they fail to achieve their goal (they may be able to try again 

12 

Call of Cthulhulater). During the game investigators may become injured, 
suffer sanity-shattering experiences, or even die! However, 
someone has to make a stand against the cosmic horrors of 
the universe and the death of a single investigator matters 
little if it means repulsing Cthulhu’s master plan to enslave 
the Earth! 

Investigators  who  survive  will  gain  power  from  arcane 
volumes of forgotten lore, knowledge of horrendous monsters, 
and advancement in their skills as they become more experi-
enced. Thus the players’ investigators will continue to progress, 
until their demise or retirement—whichever comes first.

Example of Play
If you’ve never played a roleplaying game before, you might 
still be wondering just how it all works. The following ex-
ample  of  play  provides  an  illustration  of  a  typical  gaming 
session. Don’t worry about some of the terms used, as you’ll 
become better acquainted with them as you read the rest of 
this book (there’s also a useful Glossary on page 386).

This  example  game  uses  the  classic  1920s  setting.  The 
investigators  are  trying  to  find  out  why  Boss  Morgan,  a 
notorious gangland figure, has vanished. 

Paula,  Joe,  Cathy  and  Arnold  are  the  players,  each  of 
them  controlling  an  investigator.  Garrie  is  in  the  role  of 
Keeper  and  is  running  the  game  (leading  the  story  and 
controlling  the  non-player  characters  and  monsters  in  the 
game). Notice that while the players have different ways of 
referring to their characters, Garrie the Keeper easily sorts 
out their statements and feels no need for consistency.
We join the game in mid-session…

(GARRIE) KEEPER: Well, guys, what’s your plan?

PAULA:  Let’s  sneak  around  Boss  Morgan’s  house,  looking 
for clues. 

All the investigators agree to Paula’s plan.

JOE: Let’s go! I’ll drive us over in my Hupmobile. Is there 
anyone on the street? We’re leaving at midnight.

(GARRIE) KEEPER: As you arrive at Morgan’s house, you 
see the street is pretty dark as two of the streetlights aren’t 
working. It all looks deserted. Nobody is in sight.

CATHY: My private eye Jake can pick the lock on the back 
door. 

The players agree to the plan.

PAULA: I’ll keep watch from the street

ARNOLD: I’ll stay in the car for now and keep watch—my 
investigator is still very nervous.

JOE: I’ll go with Cathy.

(GARRIE) KEEPER: Cathy and Joe, make Listen rolls.

CATHY: (rolls percentage dice) I succeeded!

JOE: I failed the roll. So, Cathy, what did you hear?

(GARRIE) KEEPER: You hear a creak of wood; sounds like 
the house’s front door quietly opening. Don’t forget to tick 
your Listen skill, as you got a success.

CATHY: Right. (She makes a check mark on her sheet). I’m 
grabbing  Joe  and  attempting  to  hide  behind  the  garbage 
cans. 

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  OK,  I’ll  need  you  both  to  make  a 
Stealth roll.

JOE and CATHY: Yeah! We both rolled successes (both tick 
their Stealth skills). We’re well hidden behind the garbage.

(GARRIE) KEEPER: Great. Since it’s night and there are no 
working  street  lamps  near,  you  can’t  see  much.  The  form 
of a hulking figure leaves the house and creeps towards the 
street. When it reaches the middle of the street, it pulls up 
a manhole cover and drops down inside. You hear a splash. 
(Garrie makes a dubious liquid-sound…)

CATHY: Did he lock the door behind him?

(GARRIE) KEEPER: Not only is it not locked, it’s wide open.

CATHY: I’ll sneak back and tell the others. 

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  The  rest  of  you,  Cathy  told  you  that 
the front door is open.

Investigators enter an abandoned mansion.

JOE and PAULA together: Let’s go inside.

13 

chapter 1: introduction(GARRIE) KEEPER: What do you do, Arnold?

ARNOLD: Are you kidding? My professor go in there? No 
way.

CATHY: He can stand guard while the rest of us go inside.

ARNOLD: All alone? No way! He’s coming inside!

(GARRIE) KEEPER: It’s very dark and quiet inside.

PAULA:  Joe,  let  me  use  your  flashlight.  I’ll  take  the  lead. 
Everyone else keep their lights doused—we don’t want to be 
seen from the street.

(GARRIE) KEEPER: You  are  in  a  hallway. You  can  go  left 
through an arch into the living room or right, through an 
open  door  into  what  looks  like  a  study.  In  front  of  you  is 

a  stairway  leading  up.  Beneath  the  stairs  is  a  closed  door. 
Ahead your beam picks out some wet patches on the floor, 
possibly  footprints.  The  water  in  the  patches  is  dirty  and 
stinking.

PAULA: Where do the footsteps come from and where are 
they going?

(GARRIE) KEEPER: You can’t tell. Everyone try a Spot Hid-
den roll. (All fail to notice droplets of water on the underside 
of the banister). What do you want to do?

PAULA: I’m going into the study, and I intend to search it.

JOE: I’ll search the living room.

ARNOLD: The professor checks out the hall closet.

CATHY: Jake goes upstairs.

(GARRIE) KEEPER (Since the group has 
split  up,  the  Keeper  now  deals  individu-
ally  with  each  player):  Paula,  there  are 
bookshelves  in  the  study,  but  strangely 
only  a  few  books.  There  are  two  un-
locked  filing  cabinets,  a  locked  desk,  a 
chair for the desk and three big leather 
easy chairs.

PAULA: I’ll open the desk first.

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  It’s  locked.  If  you 
want to pick the lock make your Lock-
smith roll.

PAULA: I rolled a 23—that’s under my 
Locksmith skill of 34—I succeed! (Paula 
ticks the skill).

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  Fine.  Now,  inside 
the desk you find two things of interest: 
a sealed envelope marked “Last Will and 
Testament” and a small ledger which is 
titled “Innsmouth Shipping Co.” Do you 
want to look at them now? (Paula wants 
to  very  much  but,  to  maintain  tension 
and pace, the Keeper now turns his atten-
tion to Cathy).

Cathy,  as  Jake  climbs  to  the  top  of  the 
stairs, he can feel beads of water under-
neath  the  wooden  banister,  as  though 
water accumulated here after something 
wet touched the railing.

CATHY: Uh-oh. Jake proceeds cautiously.

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  There  are  two 
bedrooms and a bathroom on this floor. 
The  door  to  the  right-hand  bedroom 
is  open.  There’s  a  musty,  almost  sweet 
smell here.

Never Played a  
Roleplaying Game Before?

If you’ve never played a roleplaying game before, you may be wondering 
what this is all about. To dispel some misconceptions and set you on the 
right track, it may be useful to describe an average session of play (a full, 
blow-by-blow description of a game can be found nearby).

John, his partner, and two friends meet up at John’s house on Friday 
evening at around seven o’clock. After catching up on the week’s news 
and organizing some drinks and snacks, they sit down in John’s lounge 
and  John  hands  out  some  paper  and  pencils,  then  talks  them  through 
creating their investigators. People compare ideas for characters as they 
roll dice and fill out their investigator sheets. It’s now about eight o’clock. 
John kicks off the game by describing the opening scene, telling how 
the  investigators  find  themselves  talking  with  a  man  who  wants  them 
to check out an old property that he owns; rumor has it that it might be 
haunted! One of the players immediately responds to this, putting on the 
voice of her investigator to say that such things are, “Complete hogwash”. 
As the story unfolds everyone becomes involved, describing what their 
characters are doing or saying. Dramatic conflicts arise and dice are rolled 
to  determine  the  outcome.  Sometimes  the  players  get  their  way;  other 
times events appear to conspire against them. It is all played out simply by 
talking and rolling some dice to determine the outcome of certain situa-
tions; people aren’t getting out of their chairs to act it out, neither are they 
donning costumes or using props.

John  and  his  players  cease  play  at  around  ten-thirty  then  chat  for  a 
while before calling it a night at around eleven o’clock. Everyone is looking 
forward to meeting up again next week to find out how the story develops.
Of course that’s just an example. The number of players and the dura-

tion of a session of play will vary from group to group.

Call of CthulhuCATHY: I peep in through the open door.

(GARRIE) KEEPER: As  you  enter  the  bedroom,  the  smell 
grows stronger and you see blood and gore everywhere. The 
fully clothed corpse of Boss Morgan is draped over the bed. 
The top of his head has been torn off and the insides crudely 
scooped out. You can see all this because a faint green phos-
phorescence has been traipsed over most of the room. Please 
make a Sanity roll for Jake.

CATHY: Oops, I failed.

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  Okay,  Jake  loses  1D6  Sanity.  (Garrie 
rolls  a  4  on  a  1D6).  Jake  loses  4  Sanity  points—he  turns 
green, utters a scream and then throws up at the gruesome 
sight. The rest of you hear Jake scream from upstairs.

ALL: We rush to aid him.

(GARRIE) KEEPER: OK. Each of you make a Sanity roll as 
you enter the room and see the terrible scene. (They do, with 
various results).

CATHY: After Jake has regained control of himself, he finds 
a bathroom and wipes off his trench coat.

(GARRIE) KEEPER: What are the rest of you going to do?

"Uh-oh. Jake proceeds cautiously."

JOE: I want to inspect the body closely, but without touch-
ing it. Also, I’m warning the others not to step in the blood.

fail. Paula succeeds). Paula, you hear a clanging noise from 
the street outside. The rest of you hear nothing.

PAULA: I’m searching the other rooms up here.

ARNOLD: The professor comes with you.

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  Joe,  you  can  see  more  of  the  filthy 
water splashed over the corpse. Some of it is even inside his 
brainpan.  There  are  some  abrasions  on  what  is  left  of  his 
face. Try a Spot Hidden roll.

JOE: I succeeded. Now what?

PAULA:  I  wonder  what  that  could  be?  I  hope  it’s  not  the 
manhole cover banging down!

(GARRIE) KEEPER: The front door suddenly slams closed 
and you can hear someone stomping in and up the stairs! 
(The Keeper stomps on the floor and hunches his shoulders for 
effect).

ARNOLD: My professor is waiting by the window—ready 
to jump out!

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  Seven  feet  up  the  wall  is  a  bloody, 
watery handprint. Claw marks are visible, and the print is 
at least eight inches across the palm, though the fingers are 
quite stubby. It’s not smeared at all and you can make out 
the lines of the palm in the print.

PAULA: I’m shining my light out the bedroom door, trying 
to see what’s coming.

CATHY: Jake pulls out his .38 snub-nose revolver and looks 
over Paula’s shoulder.

JOE: Wow! I’m hissing for Paula, Jake and the professor to 
get in here. Does he have his camera with him, Arnold?

JOE:  I’m  cowering  behind  Jake  and  Paula  but  I’m  getting 
out my trench knife, just in case.

ARNOLD: Dang it! I knew the professor forgot something! 
Uh, he presses a sheet of paper from a notebook against the 
print for a copy.

(GARRIE) KEEPER: He gets the print. Arnold, your profes-
sor also notices strange symbols on the opposite wall. As he 
studies them, they seem to move, swirling hypnotically.

ARNOLD: Uh-oh! He wants a closer look.

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  Shuffling  into  the  room  is  a  ghastly 
parody  of  a  man.  It  stands  almost  eight  feet  tall,  with  de-
formed,  twisted  extremities.  Its  face  is  a  mass  of  wrinkles. 
No features are visible. Its sickly brown-green skin is loose 
and strips of decaying flesh flap from its limbs. It drips the 
same  filthy  brown  water  you’ve  seen  earlier.  You  must  all 
make Sanity rolls. If you succeed you lose 1 point, if you fail 
it’s going to be 1D10 points! 

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  He  doesn’t  have  the  time.  Everyone, 
try Listen rolls for your investigators (Joe, Arnold, and Cathy 

JOE: I made my roll successfully.

ARNOLD: Hooray! I made mine too.

chapter 1: introductionRead Me— 
How to Use this Book

This book contains everything that you need to play Call 
of Cthulhu—except for dice, pencils, notepaper, and some 
friends. A wealth of support material for this game exists, 
including short, quick-play scenarios, world-encompass-
ing  campaigns  played  across  many  gaming  sessions, 
setting books, online forums, and so on. 

Before  you  run  this  game  for  the  first  time,  you 
should become familiar with the rules and concepts of 
Call of Cthulhu. This rulebook is divided into a number 
of key sections.

The  Rules  Section—everything  that  you  need  to 
know  to  play  the  game,  including  creating  investiga-
tors, the game’s rules and tips on how to get the most 
from Call of Cthulhu.

Keeper’s Reference Section—this is only for those 
who intend to run games of Call of Cthulhu (i.e. the 
Keeper). Call of Cthulhu is a game about mysteries and 
secrets, and reading these pages of reference may spoil 
your  enjoyment  if  you’re  not  planning  on  being  the 
Keeper of Arcane Lore.

If you are new to Call of Cthulhu we recommend 
you read this Introduction all the way through (espe-
cially the Example of Play on pages 13—16). Next, 
read through the rules. In addition to this, if you plan 
to run the game yourself, you should also read Chap-
ter  10:  Playing  the  Game  and  familiarize  yourself 
with the rest of the Keeper’s Reference Section (pages 
182—344). Finally, choose one of the scenarios from 
the  back  of  this  book  (Amidst  the  Ancient  Trees  is  a 
good choice). You will then be ready to run your first 
game!

However, if you are already familiar with H.P. Love-
craft and previous versions of the Call of Cthulhu game, 
you will probably want to jump straight into Chapter 
3:  Creating  Investigators  and  become  familiar  with 
the rules of this new edition.

CATHY: I blew it. (Garrie rolls the Sanity loss, getting 
3) Jake lost 3 Sanity points!

(GARRIE) KEEPER: (Paula also fails the roll). Gar-
rie  rolls  Sanity  loss  for  Paula’s  investigator,  getting 
9.  Paula,  your  investigator  is  really  shocked  by  the 
horror in front of him. Lose 9 points of Sanity.

PAULA: Uh-oh! I’m really scared!

(GARRIE) KEEPER: Let’s see (He examines her in-
vestigator’s sheet). Paula, your investigator could be 
temporarily  insane,  since  you’ve  lost  over  5  Sanity 
points.  Unless  you  roll  higher  than  his  Intelligence 
on 1D100, it’s all going to be too much for him to 
take and he’ll faint (Paula rolls a 04 and her investi-
gator faints).

(GARRIE)  KEEPER:  Since  Paula’s  investigator  was 
holding the flashlight; it’s now rolling on the floor, 
flashing  wildly  about  the  room. Arnold’s  professor 
has realized that the windows are barred with iron 
gratings. The only way outside seems to be past the 
Thing.

ALL (in confusion): I’m trying to pound open the 
bars with a chair! Where’s my flashlight? Does any-
one know what this thing is? I’m shooting at its face. 
Help! Help!

Do  the  grills  on  the  windows  unlock  and  swing 
back? What do the symbols on the wall represent? Does 
the monster attack? Did Paula’s investigator remember 
to take the ledger and legal documents he found? Does 
Jake’s .38 revolver affect the monster?

What This Game Covers
Likewise are there dread survivals of things older 
and more potent than man; things that have blas-
phemously straggled down through the aeons to ages 
never meant for them; monstrous entities that have 
lain sleeping endlessly in incredible crypts and remote 
caverns, outside the laws of reason and causation, and 
ready to be waked by such blasphemers as shall know 
their dark forbidden signs and furtive passwords.

—H.P. Lovecraft and William Lumley,  
The Diary of Alonzo Typer

The Cthulhu Mythos as originated by Lovecraft de-
fines this game; however, certain interesting concepts 
and creations by some of Lovecraft’s contemporaries 
and beyond have also been used to ensure that the 
full horrors of the Mythos can be utilized.

Many  Call  of  Cthulhu  scenarios  are  set  in  the 
United States in the 1920s—called the Classic Era—in 
which most of Lovecraft’s tales were set. To Lovecraft 
the  1920s  were  modern-day,  and  so  this  book  uses 

Call of Cthulhuboth  the  Classic  Era  and  our  own  Modern-day  as  period 
settings.  Many  supplements  and  published  scenarios  exist 
for different eras, including Gaslight Victorian and the Dark 
Ages. Set your games when you wish. If so desired, a Keeper 
may change the period to a more modern date or a more an-
cient one. The Cthulhu Mythos transcends all time and space, 
and the unfathomable machinations of the Old Ones could 
spill into any conceivable setting or historical period. 

This New Edition
Call  of  Cthulhu  was  originally  published  in  1981  and  has 
been  consistently  available  and  supported  by  Chaosium 
since  then.  This  book,  the  seventh  edition,  has  been  fully 
revised and sees some significant changes, while remaining 
compatible with previous editions. Advice for using previ-
ously published material is provided in the section Convert-
ing to 7th Edition on page 390.

Notice to Keepers
It is recommended that anyone hoping to run a game of Call 
of  Cthulhu  becomes  familiar  with  the  works  of  H.P.  Love-
craft.  By  reading  Lovecraft’s  stories,  you  will  not  only  learn 
a lot about the Cthulhu Mythos, but you will also begin to 
understand some of the key horror themes that are used in 
this  game.  You  can  read  anything  written  by  him,  but  the 
following works are the heart of the Mythos and will make 
a good start:

T  The Lurking Fear
T  The Horror at Red Hook
T  The Colour Out of Space
T  The Dunwich Horror
T  The Shadow Over Innsmouth
T  The Dreams in the Witch-House
T  The Haunter of the Dark
T  The Shunned House
T  The Call of Cthulhu 
T  The Case of Charles Dexter Ward
T  The Whisperer in Darkness
T  At the Mountains of Madness
T  The Shadow Out of Time
A  Keeper  who  reads  at  least  half  of  the  above  works, 
which  are  mostly  novelettes,  will  be  in  good  shape  to  run 
this game. Potential players of the game are encouraged to 
read at least one story before trying to investigate any of the 
mysteries of the Mythos.

What You Need to Play
When you are ready to begin playing Call of Cthulhu, you 
only need a few things to start: 

G  This rulebook.
G  Roleplaying dice.
G  Paper.
G  Pencils and an eraser.
G  Two or more people to game with.
G  A  quiet  place  (the  kitchen  table  is  a  good  place  to 

start).

G  Three or four hours in which to play the game.

Roleplaying Dice
As  mentioned,  to  play  this  game  the  Keeper  and  players 
will  need  a  set  of  roleplaying  dice,  including  percentile 
dice (D100), a four-sided die (D4), a six-sided die (D6), an 
eight-sided die (D8), and a twenty-sided die (D20). Ideally, 
to  keep  things  moving  along,  players  and  Keeper  should 
each have their own set of dice. 

People new to roleplaying may never have seen dice with 
more than six sides. A variety of them can be found at most 
hobby  game  stores  and  online—probably  including  the 
place where you bought this book.

The  letter  D  stands  for  the  word  “die”  or  “dice”.  The 
number after the D stands for the range of random numbers 
sought: D8 generates the random numbers 1 through 8, for 
instance, while D100 generates the numbers 1–100. 

The dice are used to indicate how many hit points were 
lost to an attack, to generate investigators, to determine san-
ity loss, etc. 

Reading the D100 (Percentile Dice)

Percentile  dice  (to  which  the  abbreviation  D100  refers) 
usually consist of two 10-sided dice rolled at the same time. 
These dice are sold as a pair, one (units die) being numbered 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, the other (tens die) being numbered 
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 00. When rolled, read the top 
numbers on the dice to get the result. The single digit is the 
units, the double digit the tens, and you should read them 
together. A roll of 00 on the tens die combined with a 0 on 
the units die indicates a result of 100. A roll of 00 on the tens 
die combined with any other roll on the units die indicates a 
roll of under 10; for example, a roll of 00 on the tens die and 
3 on the units die being read as 3%.

Alternatively  use  two  “units”  dice  of  different  colors, 
each numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. Read the die of one 
color  consistently  as  the  tens-digit  and  the  other  as  the 
units-digit: thus a result of 2 and 3 reads as 23, a result of 0 
and 1 reads as 1, and a result of 1 and 0 reads as 10. A result 
of 0 and 0 reads as 100.

Call of CthulhuDice Roll Variations

Sometimes  a  dice  notation  in  the  rules  or  in  a  scenario  is 
preceded by a number; it tells the reader that more than one 
such  die  should  be  rolled  and  that  their  results  should  be 
added together. For instance, 2D6 means that two 6-sided 
dice  should  be  rolled  and  totalled  (or  roll  a  D6  twice  and 
add the scores together).

Sometimes additions are shown to die rolls. You might 
see  1D6+1,  for  instance.  This  means  that  the  number  fol-
lowing the plus sign should be added to the result of the D6 
roll. For 1D6+1, the result must be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

A notation may require that different dice be rolled at one 
time.  If  a  monster  claws  for  1D6+1+2D4  damage,  find  the 
power of the actual attack by rolling the three requested dice, 
totalling the results, and adding one (thus, rolling 1D6 and 
2D4 [1D4 and another 1D4] and adding 1 to the total rolled). 
The notation “damage bonus” (or “DB”) appended to attack 
damage reminds the Keeper and players to add the monster’s 
or investigator’s “damage bonus” to the dice rolled.

The Investigator Sheet
Players  should  record  the  details  of  their  investigators  on 
investigator sheets, found near the back of this book (page 
422)  and  ready  to  photocopy—investigator  sheets  are  also 
available for free download at www.chaosium.com. There 
are  versions  for  the  1920s  and  Modern  Day  games.  The 
investigator  sheet  holds  all  the  information  needed  for 
investigators to tackle mysteries. The next chapter explains 
how to fill out this sheet.

Figures and Other Paraphernalia
Call  of  Cthulhu  can  be  played  verbally,  without  miniature 
figures  or  paraphernalia  other  than  dice  and  investigator 
sheets.  You  may  find,  however,  that  miniatures,  tokens  or 
markers  help  you  to  visualise  the  action,  denoting  where 
each  investigator  is  positioned  during  a  combat  scene  or 
determining  who’s  at  the  front  when  searching  through 
ancient catacombs and the like. Whether or not models are 
used,  players  usually  find  it  helpful  if  the  Keeper  sketches 
out the area of activity or the encounter on a sheet of graph 
or plain paper.

Likewise,  some  gaming  groups  like  to  use  props  in 
their  games,  such  as  statuettes,  letters,  books  or  even  clay 
tablets.  Such  items,  if  prepared  with  care,  can  lend  drama 
and atmosphere to a game. However, they can also end up 
looking silly if they are poorly presented. Some players can-
not believe that a polystyrene block is anything other than a 
polystyrene block; even through the Keeper has spent hours 
carving it to resemble the “Black Obelisk of Thantos”! The 
best way to decide if props will work with your group is to 
talk about it and agree whether you all feel they are worth 
the time and effort required.

chapter 1: introductionHoward Philips  
Lovecraft 

n  a  46-year  lifetime,  H.P.  Lovecraft  (HPL) 
wrote or collaborated on more than 65 stories, 
penned  dozens  of  articles  and  essays,  hun-
dreds of poems, and wrote perhaps as many as 
100,000  letters.  Despite  never  finding  critical 
and  commercial  success  in  his  lifetime,  Lovecraft’s  legacy 
and contribution to modern horror story telling cannot be 
overstated. His works now reach millions around the world 
and his creations, particularly Cthulhu and the Necronom-
icon, have become well-known horror icons for a legion of 
devoted  fans.  Today,  Lovecraft  is  recognized  as  making  a 
significant contribution to American literature and as being 
one of the foremost horror writers of the Twentieth Century.

His Life and the Creation of 
the Cthulhu Mythos
Although  chronic  nervous  disorders  prevented  Lovecraft 
from  regular  attendance  at  school,  he  was  a  precocious 
child and an avid reader. As his father was institutionalized 
when Lovecraft was only three, he and his mother moved 
into  the  house  owned  by  his  maternal  grandfather.  It 
was in the library of Grandfather Whipple that Lovecraft 
first  discovered  the  Arabian  Nights,  the  myths  of  Greece 
and  Rome,  and  Edgar Alan  Poe.  He  wrote  his  first  story, 
"The Little Glass Bottle", at the age of six, about the time 
he  had  his  first  dreams  about  the  terrible,  faceless  night-
gaunts  (throughout  his  life  he  had  vivid  dreams).  It  was 
also through this library that Lovecraft developed a taste 
for  Georgian  thought  and  literature  that  would  remain 
with  him  throughout  his  life.  Lovecraft,  who  would  later 
describe  himself  as  a  “mechanist  materialist,”  was  also 
attracted  to  the  sciences.  In  1899  he  began  publishing  a 
small journal called the Scientific Gazette, followed shortly 
thereafter by the Rhode Island Journal of Astronomy. These 
small, hectographed publications were sold door to door 
by  a  bicycle-mounted  HPL.  At  age  thirteen,  Lovecraft’s 
beloved  grandfather  died.  His  father  had  already  passed 
away,  succumbing  to  his  illness  in  1898,  still  confined  to 
Butler Hospital. A series of business failures had depleted 
the  Whipple  family  fortune,  forcing  Lovecraft’s  mother 
and  aunts  to  sell  the  family  home  and  move  to  smaller 
quarters. This was a great blow to Lovecraft.

Another  attack  of  nerves  led  to  his  withdrawal  from 
high school in 1905 and again in 1908. Lovecraft, two and 
a half years short of graduation, never returned. Lovecraft 
never held a job, supporting himself on the dwindling fam-
ily fortune and by what little he could earn as a ghostwriter 
and  revisionist. Always  the  aristocrat,  he  was  throughout 
his  life  to  remain  torn  between  the  professional  writer’s 
desire  for  success  and  money  and  the  detached,  amateur 

gentleman’s  desire  to  reach  for  aesthetic  goals  unfettered 
by commercial demands. Despite this, his first attempts to 
sell his fiction met with unqualified success, with the editor 
of Weird Tales, Edwin Baird, accepting the first five stories 
sent to him by Lovecraft. His stories appeared in nine of 
eleven issues published between late 1923 and early 1925. 
When the editorship of Weird Tales passed to the hands of 
Farnsworth Wright, Lovecraft’s fortunes changed. Wright, 
an able editor, possessed a blind spot regarding Lovecraft’s 
work  and  now  HPL  more  often  met  with  rejection  than 
success. Stories now considered classics, such as "The Call 
of  Cthulhu",  were  only  published  after  meeting  repeated 
rejections  from Weird Tales.  His  half-hearted  attempts  to 
provide  what  Wright  demanded  of  commercial  fiction 
were only partially successful. Wright rejected both "At the 
Mountains of Madness" and "The Shadow Out of Time", 
now-famous  stories  that  were  eventually  printed  by  As-
tounding Stories. The superb "The Case of Charles Dexter 
Ward"  didn’t  see  publication  until  years  after  Lovecraft’s 
death. Crushed by the repeated rejections, Lovecraft began 
refusing  to  submit  his  stories,  and  "Dreams  in  the Witch 
House" only saw print because a friend (August Derleth) 
secretly submitted it to Wright, urging him to accept it.

Ironically, it was during this time that HPL was doing 
the  bulk  of  his  professionally  published  revision  work, 
much  of  it  no  less  than  actual  ghostwriting.  Lovecraft 
might provide a nearly complete text of a story based on 
a  few  root  ideas  supplied  by  the  “author”.  Stories  such 
as  Zealia  Bishop’s “The  Curse  of  Yig”  and  Hazel  Heald’s 
“The  Horror  in  the  Museum”  were  in  fact  90%  or  more 
the product of HPL. While these stories were quickly ac-
cepted  by  Wright,  Lovecraft’s  work  under  his  own  name 
continued to be rejected.

Although he attracted a small core of avid fans—many 
of  them  writers  themselves—he  never  achieved  more 
than  semi-regular  publication  in  the  pulp  magazines  of 
the  day.  Never  as  popular  as  writers  like  Seabury  Quinn, 
Lovecraft earned most of his meager income revising and 
rewriting  the  works  of  others,  even  ghostwriting “Under 
the  Pyramids”  (1924)  for  escape  artist  Harry  Houdini.  It 
was through publication in amateur magazines, and later 
in  Weird  Tales,  that  Lovecraft  was  to  come  into  contact 
with other authors of the macabre tale.

Lovecraft  was  a  prodigious  letter  writer;  he  regularly 
corresponded with other fiction writers, including Robert 
E. Howard (creator of Conan the Barbarian), Clark Ashton 
Smith  (creator  of  Averoigne  and  Zothique)  and  Robert 
Bloch  (later  to  write  Psycho).  HPL’s  fictional  worlds  and 
histories were often discussed, as were the worlds created 
by Smith and other writers. It was not long before Smith 
and  Lovecraft  carried  this  sharing  of  ideas  into  their  fic-
tion, referring to each other’s creations in their stories. It 
was  Smith  who  gave  birth  to  such  deities  as  Tsathoggua, 
Atlach-Nacha,  and Abhoth,  and  who  created  the  magical 
tome,  the  Book  of  Eibon.  It  was  Smith’s  magical,  prehis-
toric  Hyperborea  that  Lovecraft  frequently  referred  to  in 
his tales. This idea was soon picked up by other authors. 
Robert E. Howard created the dreaded Unaussprechlichen 

22 

Call of CthulhuAldebaran. Although briefly mentioned by Lovecraft in ear-
ly tales, these were actually the creations of Ambrose Bierce 
(1842-circa 1914), an American journalist and early expo-
nent of the weird tale. Bierce was an early influence on HPL, 
as were a number of other writers. His favorite author was 
always Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), and Poe’s influence can 
be clearly seen in some of Lovecraft’s first adult fiction. “The 
Outsider” (1921) perhaps most closely emulates Poe’s style 
and subject matter. Arthur Machen (1863-1947) was anoth-
er early influence; his story “The Great God Pan” (1894) is 
very similar in theme to Lovecraft’s “The Dunwich Horror”. 
Robert  W.  Chambers  (1865-1933)  also  left  his  mark  on 
Lovecraft. A mysterious play, The King in Yellow, figures in 
some of Chambers’ stories and probably inspired Lovecraft 
to  create  the  Necronomicon,  the  Pnakotic  Manuscripts  and 
the other tomes of eldritch lore for which his tales are fa-
mous. It was Chambers who first borrowed from Bierce the 
Lake  of  Hali  and  Carcosa,  perhaps  inspiring  Lovecraft  to 
attempt transpositions.

Lord  Dunsany  (1878-1957)  was  probably  Lovecraft’s 
strongest  contemporary  influence.  It  was  Dunsany’s  The 
Gods of Pegana (1905) that encouraged Lovecraft to write 
several  dream-based  stories  and  first  provided  him  with 
the idea of an artificial pantheon of gods. Algernon Black-
wood, another contemporary admired by HPL, drew upon 
Native  American  legends  for  the  version  of  the  Wendigo 
later adapted into the Mythos by August Derleth, which is 
there called Ithaqua.

Before Lovecraft’s death, this circle of correspondents 
would include such recognizable names as Henry Kuttner, 
C. L. Moore, J. Vernon Shea, E. Hoffman Price, and Fritz 
Leiber. Some of these letters are collected in five Arkham 
House volumes, while others are published by Necronom-
icon Press. Brown University, in Lovecraft’s hometown of 
Providence,  Rhode  Island,  maintains  a  catalogued  Love-
craft collection with thousands more.

It  was  not  until  late  in  Lovecraft’s  career—and  then 
probably only at the urging of some of his younger corre-
spondents—that he began to integrate into his later stories 
some  of  the  creations  found  in  his  earliest  tales.  In “The 
Shadow  over  Innsmouth”  (1931)  we  find  the  deep  one 
hybrids worshiping Dagon, a creature not mentioned since 
the story “Dagon” (1917), his second piece of adult fiction. 
Similarly, the fictional city of Arkham and its Miskatonic 
University, first used as backdrops in “The Picture in the 
House”  (1920)  and  "Herbert  West—Reanimator"  (1921-
1922), are finally developed in his later stories, beginning 
with  “The  Dunwich  Horror”  (1928)  and  continuing 
through  to “The  Thing  on  the  Doorstep”  (1933).  At  the 
Mountains  of  Madness  (1931)  and  “The  Shadow  Out  of 
Time”  (1934-1935)  contain  detailed  histories  of  pre-hu-
man Earth, describing the different alien beings that had 
in the past visited and colonized the planet. Some of these 
races,  such  as  the  fungi  from  Yuggoth  and  the  Cthulhu 
spawn,  were  from  earlier  stories  and  were  carefully  inte-
grated into these late-devised histories. 

The  dreaded  Necronomicon,  one  of  Lovecraft’s  most 
famous  creations,  undergoes  a  gradual  evolution.  First 

The Master of American Horror, H.P. Lovecraft

Kulten and the mad poet Justin Geoffrey, author of the ter-
rible People of the Monolith. These were also incorporated 
into Lovecraft’s stories, along with references to Howard’s 
prehistoric Cimmeria.

The  young  Robert  Bloch  provided  the  blasphemous 
books De Vermiis Mysteriis and the Cultes des Goules, as well 
as the interstellar and invisible star vampire that devoured 
a  thinly  disguised  HPL  in  Bloch’s  “Shambler  from  the 
Stars” (1935). Bloch’s creations were quickly absorbed by 
Lovecraft, who also revenged his “murder” by dispatching 
protagonist Robert Blake in the “The Haunter of the Dark” 
(1936). Long-time friend Frank Belknap Long brought to 
the collection both the hounds of Tindalos and Chaugnar 
Faugn, who appeared in “The Horror in the Hills”, a story 
by Long based on one of Lovecraft’s many vivid dreams.

August  Derleth  added  the  most  to  the  now-growing 
collection of Great Old Ones and alien races. Continuing 
to write new Cthulhu Mythos stories long after Lovecraft’s 
death  in  1937,  he  created,  among  others,  Cthugha,  the 
Tcho-Tcho people, Ithaqua, and the sand-dwellers. Basing 
a  number  of  his  tales  in  Lovecraft’s  fictional  towns  of 
Arkham,  Dunwich,  Innsmouth,  and  Kingsport,  he  also 
introduced  such  characters  as  Dr.  Laban  Shrewsbury. Al-
though many disagree with Derleth’s interpretations—his 
desire to create a pantheon of good gods based on Love-
craft’s  Nodens,  and  his  attempts  to  define  Cthulhu  and 
Nyarlathotep  as  elementals—none  will  deny  this  man’s 
tireless efforts in keeping the works of Lovecraft in print 
and available to the public in the decades following HPL’s 
death by founding Arkham House Publishing. 

One  of  Derleth’s  favorite  additions  to  the  Mythos  was 
Hastur, a great being supposedly trapped beneath the Lake 
of  Hali  near  the  city  Carcosa  on  a  planet  circling  the  star 

23 

chapter 2: h.p. Lovecraft and the cthulhu mythosmentioned in “The Hound” (1922), it is here attributed 
to  an  Abdul  Alhazred,  an  Arab  poet  mentioned  in  an 
earlier story, “The Nameless City” (1921). Alhazred was, 
in fact, the boyhood persona of a five-year-old HPL, his 
youthful imagination inflamed by his grandfather’s copy 
of A Thousand and One Arabian Nights. 

Lovecraft  died  in  near  obscurity  in  March  of  1937, 
at the age of 46, a victim of Bright’s disease and virulent 
cancer.  His  mother  had  died  in  1921  after  two  years’ 
confinement  in  the  same  institution  where  his  father 
had  died.  A  brief,  two-year  marriage  accompanied  by 
residence in New York proved disastrous, though divorce 
was never made final, and in 1926 Lovecraft had returned 
home to Providence to live out his years a bachelor, shar-
ing quarters with two aunts.

These last years saw a reduced output of fiction, but 
it was during this period that he produced some of his 
most  memorable  tales.  He  also  found  time  to  travel, 
visiting places that tickled his antiquarian heart: Maine, 
Philadelphia, Quebec, St. Augustine, Charlotte, New Or-
leans,  Salem,  and  Nantucket.  Traveling  by  bus,  sleeping 
in  YMCAs,  eating  crackers,  cheese,  and  canned  beans, 
Lovecraft was able to indulge his personal tastes for trav-
el, history, and antiquity.

Plenty  of  evidence  exists  to  show  that  Lovecraft 
was, by any assessment, an odd individual. Predisposed 
to  hypochondria  and  a  premature  pose  of  old  age,  for 
much of his life he was committed to social and artistic 
views  more  suitable  to  centuries  past  than  the  one  he 
lived  in.  Allergic  to  cold  and  repulsed  by  seafood,  he 
was  also  a  scientist  and  a  philosopher  possessed  of  an 
inquiring mind and sharp wit. Most who came to know 
him during his lifetime were profoundly changed by his 
friendship. Encouraged and enlightened by his erudition 
and no-nonsense philosophies, many went onto achieve 
fame far greater than their mentor ever enjoyed during 
his lifetime. He has the same effect today, generations after 
his death. His name is better known than ever and those 
who  discover  him,  whether  through  his  stories,  through 
films, games, comics, or trading cards, find themselves as 
fascinated by his bizarre creations and nightmare worlds as 
were his contemporaries so many years ago.

After Lovecraft
The 1940s and ‘50s saw a quiet expansion of the Mythos. 
Robert Bloch and James Wade added a few stories to the 
canon;  however,  it  was  August  Derleth  who  contributed 
the  most,  producing  a  number  of  original  tales  as  well 
as  posthumous  collaborations  based  on  Lovecraft’s  story 
notes. Derleth also established Arkham House with Don-
ald Wandrei, a publishing business created to ensure that 
Lovecraft’s stories would not be forgotten. 

It  was  not  until  1964  that  the  appearance  of  a  young 
British  writer  named  Ramsey  Campbell  heralded  a  re-
newed  interest  in  the  Cthulhu  Mythos.  Encouraged  by 
August Derleth, Campbell’s first published collection, The 
Inhabitant  of  the  Lake  and  Other  Less  Welcome  Tenants 

Terminology
Occasionally referring to his Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth 
cycles,  to  the  best  of  anyone’s  knowledge  Lovecraft 
never used the term Cthulhu Mythos. Although nearly 
all  his  tales  can  be  linked  by  common  references  to 
people, places, and things, for the most part they lack 
a true central structure or anything resembling a pre-
conceived history and mythology.

The term Cthulhu Mythos is generally attributed to 
August Derleth. Fans and scholars have since debated 
the definition of this term, argued the Cthulhu Mythos 
content of various of Lovecraft’s tales, constructed ex-
perimental pantheons of gods and deities, postulated 
histories,  and  made  vain  attempts  to  explain  all  the 
facets of the literary Mythos.

In  the  meantime  dozens,  perhaps  hundreds,  of 
writers  both  professional  and  amateur  have  continued 
to  write  Mythos-inspired  stories  expanding  upon 
Lovecraft’s  original  concepts  while  simultaneously 
developing their own, sometimes inconsistent with HPL 
and rarely consistent with each other. For the purposes 
of Call of Cthulhu, Chaosium has incorporated most of 
Lovecraft’s creations, as well as those of other authors, 
in a loosely cast Mythos that allows Keepers to add or 
delete particular creatures and conceptions as they will.

(1964), was a series of Lovecraft-inspired pastiches set in 
England’s Severn Valley. These stories described a number 
of different beings, races, and histories similar to, but dis-
tinct from Lovecraft’s. His most famous Mythos creations 
include Y’golonac, Gla'aki, the insects from Shagghai, and 
a  host  of  other  creatures  and  god-like  beings.  1971  saw 
the emergence of Brian Lumley, another Englishman who 
brought  to  the  Mythos  the  underground  chthonians,  the 
mysterious  G’harne  Fragments,  and  the  modern-day  sor-
cerer Titus Crow.

Numerous other authors directly influenced by Love-
craft include Gary Myers, Basil Copper, T.E.D. Klein, David 
Drake, and Thomas Ligotti, as well as contemporaries such 
as W.H.  Pugmire,  Joseph  S.  Pulver  Sr.,  and  Laird  Barron. 
Many others, such as Stephen King, have made special con-
tributions to anthologies of new Mythos tales. Few writers 
of modern horror fiction can claim there is no Lovecraft 
influence in their work.

Lovecraftian  inspired  tales  have  also  stretched  their 
tentacles out of print and into celluloid. Today, numerous 
feature and short films have been made based upon HPL’s 
stories. Notably, Stuart Gordon’s Re-Animator (a modern 
telling of "Herbert West—Reanimator") and Dagon (a con-

24 

Call of Cthulhutemporary reworking of “The Shadow Over Innsmouth”) 
have helped bring HPL to mainstream cinema. Directors 
including John Carpenter, Frank Darabont, Guillermo del 
Toro,  and  Sam  Raimi  have  all  incorporated  Lovecraftian 
themes and references within their work.

The Cthulhu Mythos
It is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably 
with darkness, silence, and solitude.

—H. P. Lovecraft, Cool Air

the 

Lovecraft once wrote, “All my tales are based 
upon  the  fundamental  premise  that 
common  human  laws  and  inter-
ests and emotions have no va-
lidity or significance in the 
vast  cosmos  at-large.” 
He  further  imagined 
funda-
that 
truths 
mental 
of 
the  universe 
were  so  alien  and 
that 
horrifying 
mere 
exposure 
to 
them  might 
result  in  madness 
or  suicide.  While 
humanity  might 
crave  both  com-
fort and the truth, 
only  one  or  the 
other  was  possi-
ble.  The  human 
in-
is  an 
mind 
flexible  container. 
It  cannot  maintain 
cosmic 
truth 
complete  sanity—more 
of one poured in must spill 
out more of the other. Humans 
desperate  for  the  power  cloaked 
within  truth  might  choose  to  forgo  all 
remnants  of  sanity  in  exchange  for  becoming 
adept at manipulating the secrets of time and space. Their 
devil’s  bargains  made,  these  merciless  sorcerers  would 
whistle  down  devastation  and  doom  to  this  world  in  ex-
change for yet more knowledge and power.

and 

Lovecraft’s  working-out  of  these  ideas  in  his  fiction 
became known as the Cthulhu Mythos. The term encom-
passes a complex and broad group of sometimes contra-
dictory  narratives,  stories,  essays,  letters,  and  deductions, 
so extensive as to be impossible to summarize in detail—
and not the least because new Mythos material continues 
to be written around the world. Adding to the confusion, 
one of his perceptions was that the truly alien is genuinely 
unknowable.  The  Mythos  becomes  not  just  mysterious, 
but protean and contradictory; not only do we not know 

it, we never can know it. As it transpires, we have only our 
own names for most of these things. We do not even know 
their “real” names for themselves, or if they have names.

A General Summary 
Though  their  interrelations  are  obscure,  we  know  that 
some entities of the Cthulhu Mythos are clearly superior or 
inferior in their powers. Gods are the mightiest, followed 
(at some distance, apparently) by the Great Old Ones. 

Depending  on  which  author  one  reads,  the  universe 
is  ruled  by  beings  variously  known  as  the  Elder  Gods, 
Outer Gods, or Other Gods. Only a few of these deities 
are known by name. The majority are both 
blind  and  idiotic  in  human  terms. 
They  are  all  extremely  powerful 
alien  beings  and  some  may 
be of extra-cosmic origin. 
The  Outer  Gods  rule 
the universe and have 
little  to  do  with 
humanity,  except 
for  Nyarlathotep. 
Humans  med-
dling  with  these 
entities  suffer  for 
it,  usually  ending 
in  madness  or 
death.  Names  for 
a  few  Outer  Gods 
are  known.  They 
appear  almost  to 
be  true  gods,  as 
opposed 
the 
alien horror of the 
Great  Old  Ones, 
some  may 
and 
personify  a  cosmic 
principle.  Only  a  few 
these  deities  seem 
to  take  interest  in  human 
affairs, or even to acknowledge 
the  existence  of  the  human  race. 
When they do, they often are shown try-
ing to break through cosmic walls or dimensions 
to wreak new destruction. All the races and lesser deities 
of  the  Mythos  acknowledge  the  Outer  Gods,  and  many 
worship them.

of 

to 

The Outer Gods are controlled to some extent by their 
messenger and soul, Nyarlathotep. When the Outer Gods 
are discomforted, Nyarlathotep investigates. Azathoth, the 
daemon sultan and ruler of the cosmos, writhes mindlessly 
to the piping of a demon flute at the center of the universe. 
Yog-Sothoth, either a second-in-command or co-ruler, is 
coterminous with all time and space, but locked somehow 
outside the mundane universe. Yog-Sothoth can be sum-
moned to this side only through the use of mighty spells, 
whereas Azathoth theoretically might be met by traveling 

25 

chapter 2: h.p. Lovecraft and the cthulhu mythosfar  enough  through  space.  A  group  of  Outer  Gods  and 
bizarre beings dance slowly around Azathoth, but none are 
named.

The  term  Elder  Gods  sometimes  refers  to  another 
race  of  gods,  neutral  to  and  possibly  rivals  of  the  Outer 
Gods. The Elder Gods, if they exist, do not seem to be as 
dangerous  to  humanity  as  Azathoth  and  its  ilk,  but  they 
have even less contact with humanity. Nodens is the best-
known Elder God.

Outer  and  Elder  Gods  sometimes  have  been  lumped 
together  and  confusingly  called  the  Other  Gods,  though 
primarily gods of the outer planets and not of our Earth. 
They would seem seldom called here, however when they 
do appear they are second to nothing in horror. (And, just 
to  thoroughly  confuse  you,  a  set  of  minor  Outer  Gods 
are known collectively as the Lesser Other Gods!) Species 
associated  with  these  deities  (shantaks,  hunting  horrors, 
servitors  of  the  Outer  Gods,  dark  young  of  Shub-Niggu-
rath) are correspondingly rare on Earth.

The  Great  Old  Ones  are  not  as  supernatural  as  the 
Outer  Gods,  but  are  nonetheless  god-like  and  terrible  to 
human  eyes.  Humans  are  much  more  likely  to  worship 
Great Old Ones, who are comparatively near at hand and 
who  occasionally  participate  in  human  affairs  or  contact 
individual humans, than they are to worship Outer Gods. 
Entire  clans  or  cults  may  secretly  worship  a  Great  Old 
One. Lone madmen, on the other hand, seem to prefer the 
Outer Gods. Beings serving the Great Old Ones frequently 
inhabit the remote fastness of the Earth. Investigators most 
often encounter their worshipers and alien servants.

The Great Old Ones themselves appear to be immensely 
powerful  alien  beings  with  supernatural-seeming  abilities, 
but not to be true gods in the sense that the Outer Gods are 
reported. Each Great Old One is independent of the rest and 
many seem to be temporarily imprisoned in some way. It is 
said that, “When the stars are right,” the Great Old Ones can 
plunge from world to world. When the stars are not right, 
they cannot live. “Cannot live” need not mean death, as the 
famous couplet from the Necronomicon suggests:

That is not dead which can eternal lie, 
And with strange aeons even death may die. 

Cthulhu,  the  most  famous  creation  of  Lovecraft,  is  a 
Great Old One. With the rest of his race, he sleeps in a vast 
tomb at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Cthulhu seems 
to be the most important Great Old One on Earth. Others 
of  differing  forms  exist  and  they  are  recorded  as  being 
both less powerful and more free. Ithaqua the Windwalker 
roams  at  will  across  Earth’s  arctic  latitudes.  Hastur  the 
Unspeakable  dwells  near  Aldebaran,  and  Cthugha  near 
Fomalhaut.  Other  Great  Old  Ones  doubtless  infest  other 
worlds and it may be common for a world to be ruled by 
dominant Great Old Ones. All those known on Earth are 
invoked or worshiped by humans but, by the evidence of 
the  stories,  Cthulhu  is  worshiped  more  than  the  rest  put 
together.  Minor  Great  Old  Ones  such  as  Quachil  Uttaus 
usually have no worshipers, but wizards may know spells 

What Was Left Out
The  original  designer,  Sandy  Petersen,  took  the  deci-
sion  to  ignore  a  portion  of  the  Mythos  that  did  not 
appeal to him and which he felt was not in Lovecraft’s 
original  concept.  He  left  out  the  “war  in  heaven”  in 
which the Great Old Ones battled and were defeated 
by the Elder Gods, supposed deities of good opposed 
to the cosmic evil of the Great Old Ones. This idea of 
a cosmic war is never found in Lovecraft’s own works; 
more  alarmingly,  it  vitiates  some  of  the  stark  horror 
found in the original ideas. Carrying Elder Signs around 
like  crucifixes  and  holy  water  and  always  having  the 
white-hat Elder Gods in the background, ready to save 
one’s bacon if things get too bad, greatly weakens the 
original horror of the bleak uncaring universe, to which 
mankind  is  left  naked  and  defenseless.  He  also  left 
out the concept of the various Great Old Ones being 
somehow  connected  to  the  Greek  elements  of  Earth, 
Water,  Fire,  and  Air  (exemplified  by  Nyarlathotep, 
Cthulhu, Cthugha, and Hastur, respectively). This idea 
falls apart under close inspection (if Cthulhu is a water 
god, why is he currently dead due to being under the 
sea?), and weakens the premise of the Great Old Ones 
being monstrous alien beings. 

In  addition,  for  this  current  edition,  the  designers 
have omitted classifying Mythos races into the divisions 
of Servitor and Independent (greater and lesser varieties). 
Such classifications tend to diminish the alien quality of 
these  beings,  stripping  away  some  of  the  unknowable 
quality which HPL bequeathed them. The organization, 
hierarchy,  and  allegiances  of  Mythos  races  should  be 
mysterious, inhuman, and confounding.

Naturally, if these conceptions seem good and well 
done to the Keeper, use them at will. Call of Cthulhu 
is your game.

to  summon  them.  Interventions  by  Great  Old  Ones  in 
human  affairs  are  isolated.  Some  commentators  suspect 
that these greater beings rarely think about human beings 
or  take  them  into  account.  Humanity  is  negligible  and 
unimportant. 

Certain Mythos species are often associated with partic-
ular Great Old Ones or Outer Gods—byakhee with Hastur, 
for instance, or nightgaunts with Nodens. Frequently a god 
or Great Old One manifests accompanied by several such 
beings.  Representatives  may  act  as  hit  men,  messengers, 
spies  and  delivery  boys,  frightening  off  investigators  and 
bulking  out  confrontations.  In  comparison,  Outer  Gods 
and Great Old Ones should be met infrequently.

26 

Call of CthulhuOther alien species are also important, and sometimes 
have been able to hold their own against Great Old Ones. 
Such beings vary in power and some are now extinct. They 
are intimately connected with our planet, as described in 
At  the  Mountains  of  Madness  and  “The  Shadow  Out  of 
Time.” In these stories Lovecraft gives the true history of 
the  Earth.  Some  species,  such  as  dholes  or  flying  polyps, 
make no association with particular gods or else, as with 
elder things and the Great Race, take no special interest in 
magic.

At the dawn of the Cambrian age, beings known only 
as the elder things flew to the Earth. They inhabited much 
of  the  land,  warred  with  other  species,  and  finally  were 
pushed  back  to  Antarctica.  The  elder  things,  perhaps 
mistakenly,  bred  organisms  eventually  to  evolve  into 
the  dinosaurs,  mammals,  and  humanity.  They  also  bred 
the  horrible  shoggoths,  whose  ultimate  revolt  led  to  the 
near-extinction of the elder things.

Eons  ago,  indigenous  cone-shaped  beings  had  their 
minds taken over by the Great Race of Yith, mental beings 
from  the  stars.  The  Great  Race  survived  in  their  adopted 
bodies until about 50 million years ago, when they were de-
feated by terrible flying polyps not native to this Earth, which 

the Great Race had imprisoned in vast caverns beneath the 
surface.  However,  the  Great  Race  had  already  transmitted 
their minds forward in time to escape their doom.

The star-spawn of Cthulhu came down upon the Earth 
and  conquered  a  vast  reach  of  land  in  the  primordial 
Pacific Ocean, but were trapped when it sank beneath the 
surface. The beings referred to as the fungi from Yuggoth 
(or mi-go) established their first bases on the Earth in the 
Jurassic period, about a hundred million years ago. They 
gradually reduced their bases to the tops of certain moun-
tains, where they maintain mining colonies and such.

Dozens of other races also participated in this antedi-
luvian parade, such as the serpent people who built cities 
and a civilization in the Permian, before the dinosaurs had 
evolved, and a winged race that succeeded the Great Race 
of Yith.  Even  species  from  Earth’s  future  are  mentioned, 
such as the beetle-like organisms that one day will succeed 
man, and the intelligent arachnids that are prophesied to 
be the last intelligent life on Earth, billions of years hence. 
At  present,  humans  share  the  planet  with  deep  ones  and 
ghouls (which seem related to humanity in some fashion), 
and  with  a  handful  of  mi-go.  Other  species  occasionally 
visit Earth, or are sleeping, or are dormant.

Great Cthulhu will rise when the Stars Are Right!

chapter 2: h.p. Lovecraft and the cthulhu mythosAbout This Chapter

n  Call  of  Cthulhu,  each  player  takes  the  role 
of an investigator, someone whose mission is 
to  unearth  hidden  secrets,  discover  forgotten 
places and, armed with knowledge which man 
was  not  meant  to  know,  stand  against  the 

bloodcurdling horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos. 

Working  as  a  team,  investigators  can  come  from  dis-
parate  backgrounds  and  be  of  varied  occupations—each 
bringing certain expertise to the group. Together, joined in 
comradeship and common purpose, you will stand steadfast 
against the coming darkness.

This chapter provides the rules for creating investigator 
player characters. At the end of this chapter you’ll also find 
some alternative methods for creating investigators, as well 
as  a  two-page  spread  that  provides  a  handy  summary  for 
quick reference.

Creating your own investigator 
from scratch is great fun. 
The rules detail rolling your 
investigator’s statistics, 
choosing an occupation and 
skills and developing a personal 
history. When beginning a game 
of Call of Cthulhu, it is 
recommended that all the players 
‘roll-up’ their investigators 
together in the company of the 
person who will be taking on 
the role of Keeper—this ensures 
that everyone helps to ‘form’ 
the group, with each investigator 
taking an agreed role, ensuring 
that a balance of skills and 
occupations is found.

Creating Your  
Investigator
There is more than one approach to creating an investigator. 
Some  people  prefer  to  have  an  idea  about  the  type  of  in-
vestigator they wish to create before rolling any dice, while 
others prefer to let the dice rolls guide their choices. What 
follows are the standard rules for creating investigators, with 
further options at the end of this chapter. More guidance is 
provided in Chapter 10: Playing the Game.

The Steps
Here are the five steps to creating an investigator:

G  Step One: Generate Characteristics
G  Step Two: Determine Occupation
G  Step Three: Decide Skills and allocate Skill Points
G  Step Four: Create a backstory
G  Step Five: Equip investigator 

Step 1: Generate                   
Characteristics
A  characteristic  is  one  of  eight  numbers  that  create  the 
foundations for an investigator. In the game, each charac-
teristic represents an aspect of an investigator—intelligence, 
dexterity, and so on. These identified quantities determine 
the relative capability of investigators and suggest ways for 
them to act and react during play.

Characteristic values are generated randomly by rolling 
two or more six-sided dice. Each rolled result is then multi-
plied by 5 to generate a percentage number that may initially 
range between 15% and 90%. 

Rolling Characteristics
Initially write your results on a piece of scrap paper before 
writing  them  onto  the  investigator  sheet  as  they  may  be 
modified by the age of your investigator. 

STR (Strength): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 to 
generate the Strength characteristic.

Strength measures the muscle power of an investigator. The 
higher it is, the more the investigator can lift or tightly cling 
to something. This characteristic determines the damage an 
investigator  inflicts  in  hand-to-hand  combat.  Reduced  to 
STR 0, an investigator is an invalid, unable to get out of bed. 

CON (Constitution): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 
5 to generate the Constitution characteristic.

Constitution  represents  health,  vigor,  and  vitality.  Poisons 
and diseases may directly challenge an investigator’s consti-
tution. Investigators with a high constitution often have more 
hit  points—the  better  to  resist  injury  and  attack.  Serious 
physical injury or magical attack might lower the statistic, and 
if constitution reaches zero, the investigator dies. 

30 

Call of CthulhuDo Low Characteristics 
Make Poor Investigators?
Often in roleplaying games, the higher the player char-
acter’s  characteristics,  the  better  the  chances  for  that 
character’s  success  in  the  game.  However,  in  Call  of 
Cthulhu, low characteristic scores do not always mean 
that  the  investigator  will  be  hindered  and  unable  to 
perform as part of the investigator’s group. Often one 
or two low characteristic scores can help to bring the 
investigator ‘to life’ and feel more real—as opposed to 
some incredible superhuman!

Rather than rejecting a low roll, try to incorporate it 
into the overall makeup of your investigator. Perhaps a 
low dexterity means that the investigator has suffered 
some  form  of  leg  or  hand  injury  while  in  the  armed 
forces, or a low education is the result of never attend-
ing school and being forced to grow up on the streets.

SIZ (Size): Roll 2D6+6 and multiply by 5 to 
generate a Size characteristic. 

Size averages both height and weight into a single number. 
To see over a wall, to squeeze through a small opening, or 
even to judge whose head might be sticking up out of the 
grass, use size. Size helps determine hit points and damage 
bonus  and  build.  One  might  decrease  SIZ  to  indicate  the 
loss  of  a  limb,  though  lowering  DEX  is  more  often  the 
solution. Presumably if investigators lose all SIZ points they 
disappear—goodness knows to where!

DEX (Dexterity): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 
to generate a Dexterity characteristic. 

Investigators with higher Dexterity scores are quicker, nimbler 
and more physically flexible. A DEX roll might be made to grab 
a support to keep from falling, to move faster than an opponent, 
or to accomplish some delicate task. An investigator with zero 
DEX is uncoordinated and unable to perform physical tasks.

In combat, the character with the highest DEX acts first 

(see Chapter 6: Combat).

APP (Appearance): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 
to generate an Appearance characteristic. 

Appearance measures both physical attractiveness and per-
sonality. A person with high APP is charming and likeable, 
but may lack conventional good looks. Someone with APP 
of 0 is appallingly ugly, possibly with a wholly detestable 
demeanor, provoking comment and shock everywhere. 

APP may be useful in social encounters or when trying 

to make a good impression. 

INT (Intelligence): Roll 2D6+6 and multiply 
by 5 to generate an Intelligence characteristic. 

Intelligence represents how well investigators learn, remem-
ber,  analyze  information  and  solve  complex  puzzles.  An 
investigator with zero INT is a babbling, drooling idiot. 

Intelligence determines the number of Personal Interest 
skill points (multiply INT × 2) allotted to a new investigator 
(see Personal Interests page 36). INT also acts as the value 
for  both  Idea  rolls  and  Intelligence  rolls  (see  Chapter  5: 
Game System).

If the amount of INT seems to contradict another char-
acteristic, that’s another chance for roleplaying and further 
defining your investigator. For example, an investigator with 
high  EDU  and  low  INT  might  be  a  pedantic  teacher  or  a 
sideshow performer, someone who knows facts but not their 
meanings. Conversely, high INT and low EDU might mean 
ignorance—such as an uneducated farm boy, new to the Big 
City—however this person would not be dull-witted. 

POW (Power): Roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 to 
generate a Power characteristic. 

Power indicates force of will; the higher the POW, the higher 
the  aptitude  for,  and  resistance  to,  magic.  An  investigator 
with  zero  POW  is  zombie-like  and  without  "purpose,"  as 
well as being unable to use magic. Unless stated otherwise, 
POW that is lost during the game is lost permanently.  

Sanity points (SAN) begin the game equal to the char-
acter’s  POW.  Sanity  points  are  covered  in  more  detail  in 
Chapter 8: Sanity.

POW dictates the character’s number of "magic points," 
which,  unlike  POW,  can  be  spent  and  regenerated  during 
play. Magic points are equal to one-fifth of POW (see Chap-
ter 10: Magic).

The POW of ordinary characters and investigators rarely 
changes. However, those adroit in the mysteries of the magic 
of the Cthulhu Mythos may be able to increase their person-
al POW. 

EDU (Education): Roll 2D6+6 and multiply by 
5 to generate an Education characteristic.

Education is a measure of the formal and factual knowledge 
possessed by the investigator, as well as indicating the time 
the investigator has spent in full-time education. EDU mea-
sures retained information, not the intelligent application of 
that information (see Intelligence). An investigator without 
EDU would be like a newborn baby or an amnesiac—with-
out  knowledge  of  the  world,  probably  very  curious  and 
credulous. 

An EDU of 60 suggests the investigator is a high school grad-
uate, while a score of around 70 indicates a person with some 
college years. Those with an EDU greater than 80 have most like-
ly conducted graduate level work and have a degree, as expected 
of a person who has been to a university of some kind. Note that 
sometimes a person with a high Education may not necessarily 
be schooled in the traditional sense, but rather may be self-taught 
and possess a highly studious and observant nature. 

31 

chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORSEDU is a factor in determining how many Occupational 
skill points (see Occupation Skills page 36) an investigator 
begins with, and represents the investigator’s starting per-
centage for the Own Language skill (see page 67). EDU is 
also used when making Know rolls (see Chapter 5: Game 
System).

Note: From this point forward, any references to a char-
acteristic are to the full value (dice roll multiplied by five). 
Any adjustments are made to that value. 

Luck
When creating an investigator roll 3D6 and multiply by 5 
for a Luck score. See Chapter 5: Game System for how Luck 
is used.

Age
A  player  can  choose  any  age  between  15  and  90  for  their 
investigator.  If  you  wish  to  create  an  investigator  outside 
this age range, it is up to the Keeper to adjudicate. Use the 
appropriate  modifiers  for  your  chosen  age  only  (they  are 
not cumulative).

G  15  to  19  years  old:  Deduct  5  points  among  STR 
and SIZ. Deduct 5 points from EDU. Roll twice to 
generate a Luck score (see Luck, above) and use the 
higher value.

G 20 to 39 years old: Make an improvement check for EDU.
G 40 to 49 years old: Make 2 improvement checks for 
EDU  and  deduct  5  points  among  STR,  CON  or 
DEX, and reduce APP by 5.

G 50 to 59 years old: Make 3 improvement checks for 
EDU  and  deduct  10  points  among  STR,  CON  or 
DEX, and reduce APP by 10.

G 60 to 69 years old: Make 4 improvement checks for 
EDU  and  deduct  20  points  among  STR,  CON  or 
DEX, and reduce APP by 15.

G 70 to 79 years old: Make 4 improvement checks for 
EDU  and  deduct  40  points  among  STR,  CON  or 
DEX, and reduce APP by 20.

G 80 to 89 years old: Make 4 improvement checks for 
EDU  and  deduct  80  points  among  STR,  CON  or 
DEX, and reduce APP by 25.

To make an EDU improvement check, simply roll per-
centile dice. If the result is greater than your present EDU, 
add  1D10  percentage  points  to  your  EDU  characteristic 
(note that EDU cannot go above 99).

The Horror in Clay

Half and Fifth Characteristic Values
Once the percentage values for each characteristic have been 
determined, the next step is to write in the half and fifth val-
ues for each characteristic on the investigator sheet, entering 
the values alongside the percentage. 

G Divide the percentage value by two, rounding down, 

and enter after the "half " percentage value.

G Divide the percentage value by five, rounding down, 
and enter the "fifth" value after the half value.

When a "characteristic value" is referred to in the text, 
this means the full value (highest number). Where half or 
fifth values are required, this will be clearly stated, normally 
called Hard (half value) and Extreme (fifth value) rolls.

Half and fifth are the only fractions used in relation to 
characteristics and skills in the game and all the numbers are 
calculated up front so that play is not hindered by mental 
calculations. A  Quick Reference Chart for Half and Fifth 
Values can be found on page 49.

Alternatively, an electronic investigator sheet that auto-
matically does all the calculations for you is available from 
the www.chaosium.com website.

Call of CthulhuOther Attributes

Damage Bonus and Build [STR & SIZ]
All investigators, Keeper-controlled characters and monsters 
have attributes known as "Damage Bonus" (DB) and Build. 
Larger and stronger creatures and humans do more physical 
damage than their weaker brethren. 

To determine damage bonus, add STR to SIZ and look 
up  the  total  on  Table  1:  Damage  Bonus  and  Build.  Each 
range of results correlates with a die modifier or dice roll. 
Build is determined using the same figures.

In  hand-to-hand  combat,  add  the  indicated  damage 
bonus modifier or roll to all the character’s blows, whether 
using a natural weapon, such as a fist, or a melee weapon.  

Build is used in fighting maneuvers and chases, and also 
to give a sense of scale (see Fighting Maneuvers, page 105).
Note: Damage bonus is not applied to firearms attacks.

Someone with a combined STR and SIZ of 134 would 
add  1D4  to  hand-to-hand  damage  rolls,  while  a 
weakling investigator whose combined value is only 
70 would deduct 1 point from melee damage.

Hit Points [CON & SIZ] 
Hit points are used to track the cumulative damage inflicted 
upon  an  investigator,  non-player  character,  or  monster 
during the game, and indicate how long he or she can stay in 
the action before collapsing from pain, exhaustion, or death.
Figure out the character’s hit point total by adding CON and 
SIZ, then dividing the total by ten (rounding down any fractions).
The investigator sheet is designed to help the player keep 
track  of  hit  points  and  wounds.  Enter  the  investigator’s  Hit 
Point Total in the box marked "Hit Points". For more details on 
hit points and wounds, see Wounds and Healing (page 119).

Movement Rate (MOV) 
An investigator can move a number of yards (or meters) up 
to five times their MOV value in one round.

If both DEX and STR are each less than SIZ:  MOV 7
If either STR or DEX is equal to or greater  
MOV 8
than SIZ, or if all three are equal:  
If both STR and DEX are each greater than SIZ: MOV 9

If age is in the 40s:              deduct 1 from MOV
If age is in the 50s:              deduct 2 from MOV
If age is in the 60s:              deduct 3 from MOV
If age is in the 70s:              deduct 4 from MOV
If age is in the 80s:              deduct 5 from MOV

Note: Do not apply these MOV rules to non-humans.

Step 2: Determine  
Occupation
An occupation shows how an investigator makes a living, be 
it as a doctor, a student, or lowlife fraudster. An occupation 
also reflects a particular investigator’s field of expertise, and 
so dictates which of their skills should be higher.

The  actual  occupation  of  your  investigator  will  have 
limited effect during the game; it is simply a basis for your 
investigator’s starting skills and helping to define his or her 
backstory.  Some  occupations  are  typically  Lovecraftian: 
Antiquarian, Author, Dilettante, Doctor of Medicine, Jour-
nalist,  Police  Detective,  and  Professor.  Other  occupations 
are not those you would normally find in a Lovecraft story, 
however they may interest particular players and be fun to 
play in a Call of Cthulhu game.

An  occupation  ties  together  a  cluster  of  skills.  For 
instance,  in  the  sample  occupations,  Antiquarian  encom-
passes:  Appraise,  Art/Craft,  History,  Library  Use,  Other 
Language,  one  interpersonal  skill  (Charm,  Fast  Talk,  In-
timidate, or Persuade), Spot Hidden, and one other skill of 
the player’s choice (to reflect something special or relevant 
about the investigator’s past). Some occupations include no 
free choices; others may have two or more.

Once you have chosen the occupation for your investi-
gator, write it down on the investigator sheet and then make 
a note of the occupation's professional skills.

Sample occupations can be found on page 40.

Allocate Skill Points

Occupation Skills
After you have chosen an occupation, calculate your occupa-
tion skill points using the characteristics specified alongside 
the  occupation.  Allocate  the  resulting  total  as  percentage 
points among those skills listed for the occupation—your in-
vestigator’s professional skills. Points should also be allocated 
to Credit Rating within the range indicated for the occupa-
tion. Not all the skills need to have points allotted to them, 
however points left undistributed are lost. Note that each skill 
has a number in brackets next to it on the investigator sheet: 
this is the base chance of success in that skill, and any points 
allocated to that skill are added to this base number.

Write down the total points for each skill on the investi-
gator sheet (the points you’ve allocated plus the base chance 
printed on the investigator sheet). The sheet also has space 
to write in the half and fifth values for each skill, allowing 
you  to  reference  them  quickly  in  the  middle  of  a  game. A 
Quick Reference Chart for half and fifth values can be found 
on page 49. It is advised that you allocate occupation skill 
points and then personal interest skill points before writing 
in the half and fifth values alongside the full value for each 
skill, as personal interest skill points can be used to bolster 
occupation skills as well as other non-occupation skills (see 
Personal Interests following).

Personal Interests 
Investigators also draw upon experience, skills, and knowl-
edge  gained  from  hobbies  and  other  non-professional  ac-
tivities, called personal interests. Multiply the investigator’s 
INT × 2 and allot the points to any skills (which can include 
adding further points to occupation skills), except Cthulhu 
Mythos (unless otherwise agreed with the Keeper). 

Write down the total points for each skill on the investigator 
sheet (the points you’ve allocated plus the base chance printed 
on the investigator sheet). The sheet also has space to write in 
the half and fifth values for each skill, allowing you to reference 
them quickly in the middle of a game. A Quick Reference Chart 
for half and fifth values can be found on page 49. 

Weapons and Firearm skills
Fighting  and  Firearms  skills,  and  their  various  specializa-
tions, allow an investigator to use weapons. Personal interest 
or  occupation  skill  points  (if  applicable)  may  be  spent  to 
raise any of these skills. When an occupation includes the 
skill of Fighting or Firearms, and no specialization is speci-
fied, it is up to the player to choose one or more specializa-
tions of that skill (see Chapter 4: Skills).

When Choosing an  
Occupation, there are 
Some Things to Consider.
Try to have a picture in your mind about who and what 
your investigator is—your character concept. Look for 
occupations that suit this concept and add color to it. 
Remember, rolling up an investigator is all about build-
ing up a story of who you want to play in the game. 
Your characteristics, occupation, sex, and age all help 
to establish a fully rounded, ‘breathing’ investigator.

Look through the skills associated with each occu-
pation and see which of these you like the most. Cer-
tain skills are likely to appeal to you more. Perhaps you 
want your investigator to be a man of action, leading 
you to choose an occupation with skills like Fighting, 
Climb, and Throw. Alternatively you might decide to 
create a more studious investigator, with skill in Library 
Use, Spot Hidden, and Psychology. 

Also,  you  might  want  to  consider  your  investiga-
tor’s  occupation  and  skill  set  in  relation  to  the  other 
players  and  what  kind  of  investigators  they  will  be 
playing. Creating a balance of occupations means that 
the group has a good mix of skills that will benefit ev-
eryone. Depending on the style of game and scenario 
you  will  be  playing,  your  Keeper  might  have  certain 
occupations in mind for you to play. Discuss your ideas 
with the other players in order to build the most appro-
priate group of investigators for your game. After all, it 
will be somewhat strange for everyone to turn up with 
musicians when the scenario is set in the Antarctic! 

Remember,  it’s  not  what  your  investigator  can  or 
can’t do, it’s how you decide to ‘play’ your character 
that is really important, and that, above all, will often 
determine your enjoyment of the game! 

Credit Rating
An  investigator’s  starting  Credit  Rating  is  determined 
during  character  creation,  based  upon  the  investigator’s 
chosen  profession  (see  Sample  Occupations  page  40).  In 
play, Credit Rating determines the amount of money a char-
acter  has  available  (see  Table  II:  Cash  and Assets).  Credit 
Rating also indicates the general living standards a person 
can afford, as well as indicating the character’s relative status 
in society (see Credit Rating in Chapter 4: Skills).

Your investigator’s Credit Rating skill begins at zero. The 
range  of  starting  levels  for  each  profession  can  be  broad,

by 4) yields 336 points to add to the skills listed for the 
Journalist  occupation,  as  well  as  for  his  Credit  Rating 
value.  Harvey’s  INT  is  85,  so  his  personal  interest  skill 
point total is 170 points (85 × 2 = 170). These points can 
be spent as the player desires. Harvey ‘s player allocated 
41 occupation skill points for Credit Rating, this means 
that he has an Average living standard. He may stay in 
moderately priced hotels, eat out (economically) and take 
the occasional taxi. With all of his points spent, his player 
writes down the half and fifth values for each of the skills 
on the investigator sheet.

For his backstory, Harvey’s player writes ‘handsome, 
well-dressed  and  a  little  overweight’  for  his  personal 
description. She then uses the random tables for the rest 
of Harvey’s backstory. Putting this all down on the sheet, 
it reads:

• 

• 

• 

Personal  description:  Handsome,  well  dressed 
and a little overweight. 
Ideology  /  Beliefs:  Fate.  Looks  for  signs  and 
omens. 
Significant  people:  Uncle  Theodore,  who  in-
spired  a  love  of  archaeology.  Harvey  will  prove 
himself  a  better  man  than  his  uncle,  who  was 
driven mad by his obsessions. 

•  Meaningful location: Study on the upper floor 

of home. 
Treasured  item:  Archaeological  artifacts  that 
belonged to his uncle, now in Harvey’s study. 
Trait: Ladies’ man.

Harvey doesn’t need anything else to begin play, just 
a notebook, pen and a lucky penny. If he were to list a car 
among his starting gear, this would have to come out of 
his assets, as a car is not listed within the 1920s Average 
Income bracket. 

Harvey is now ready to begin his adventures!

To  help  illustrate  the  various  rules  of  Call  of  Cthulhu, 
we  are  pleased  to  introduce  you  to  Harvey Walters,  the 
noted 1920s New York journalist and investigator of the 
supernatural. To differentiate between the person playing 
Harvey and the actual character of Harvey (the investiga-
tor in the game), the player is female and her investigator 
is male.

To  start,  we  need  to  roll-up  Harvey’s  characteristics. 
The player takes up a fresh investigator sheet and a pencil, 
and then she rolls some six-sided dice.

Harvey's player rolled a 4 for Harvey, which when mul-
tiplied by 5 gives him a Strength of 20%. This is abysmal. 
Harvey is exceptionally puny and weak, but the player is 
not dismayed—Call of Cthulhu is an unusual game, and 
all kinds of investigators are needed. Luckily for Harvey, the 
player next rolled a 14, which makes a CON of 70%. This is 
good, and Harvey will be fairly hardy. This may help make 
up for his low STR.

Harvey’s other characteristics work out as: SIZ of 80% 
(all that time sitting reading and having no exercise means 
that it is likely that he is overweight); DEX  60%  (a high 
average); APP 85% (whatever his other flaws, Harvey has a 
sparkling personality); INT 85% (an excellent score); POW 
45% (which gives him 9 Magic Points but  a  low  starting 
sanity—he begins with 45 SAN); EDU 80% (Harvey can 
be assumed to have graduated from college). Harvey’s play-
er rolls 9 to determine his Luck value, so Harvey begins the 
game with Luck 45.

His player wants Harvey to be 42 year old. She makes 
two  experience  checks  for  Education.  Harvey’s  EDU  is 
80. Her first roll of 86 earns a reward of 4 points (1D10). 
Harvey’s Education is now 84. Her second roll of 82 fails to 
earn any reward. She then reduces his DEX by 5 to 55 and 
APP by 5 to 80; he’s not as spritely as he once was but he’s 
still a handsome chap.

With all of the characteristics done, his player can now 
write in the half and fifth values for each of them. Harvey’s 
EDU 84 is divided by 2, giving a Half value of 41%. Then 
divided by 5 for the Fifth value (84 divided by 5, rounded 
down, equals 16%). Harvey’s player writes these scores in 
the boxes provided on the sheet and repeats the exercise for 
all the other characteristics. 

Now  Harvey’s  Damage  Bonus  and  Build  are  deter-
mined. Harvey Walters has no damage bonus and 0 build, 
as his STR and SIZ add up to a total of 100. With CON 
70 and SIZ 80 totaling 150, Harvey has 15 hit points (150 
divided by 10 = 15). 

Harvey Walters has STR 20, SIZ 80 and DEX 55. His 
STR and DEX are each less than his SIZ so Harvey’s MOV 
is 7. He is 42 years of age, and so this is reduced by a further 
point to MOV 6. Harvey will not be winning many chases.
Harvey  Walters  is  a  journalist,  working  for  Enigma 
Magazine.  Journalists  use  EDU  ×  4  to  calculate  their 
occupation  skill  points.  Harvey’s  EDU  84  (multiplied

Call of Cthulhuand  the  level  chosen  should  reflect  the  investigator’s  rank 
in  that  profession.  For  example,  "criminal"  could  be  used 
as a profession for a poor lone pickpocket (Credit Rating 9) 
or for a wealthy gang boss (Credit Rating 90). Any number 
of skill points can be invested in Credit Rating within the 
recommended limits for that profession. 

There are six living standards: penniless, poor, average, 
wealthy, rich, and super rich. Each one determines the life-
style,  type  of  accommodation,  travel,  and  expenses  that  a 
person can comfortably afford on a day-to-day basis.

Step 4: Create a Backstory 
Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever 
be induced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of 
the vague data which survives comes from those outside the 
final fighting party. There is something frightful in the care 
with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which 
bore the least allusion to the matter.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward

Most of the ideas and abilities that make an investigator inter-
esting and fun to play are a matter of choice—not necessarily 
dice roll results. Think about what personal history, friends, 
enemies, and achievements could have led your investigator 
to delve into the secrets of the Mythos.

There are ten categories listed on the back of the investigator 
sheet; try to write down at least one entry for the first six (Person-
al Description, Ideology/Beliefs, Significant People, Meaningful 
Locations,  Treasured  Possessions,  and  Traits).  It’s  not  essential 
to have an entry for each category, but the more you are able to 
define, the more your investigator comes to life. Further entries 
may be added or existing ones altered during play.

The categories of Injuries & Scars, Phobias & Manias, Ar-
cane Tomes, Spells & Artifacts, and Encounters with Strange 
Entities may be written in during play. Of course, some in-
vestigators might start the game with a significant injury or 
scar if implied by your investigator’s history—if so, write it in.
An  investigator’s  background  serves  three  functions  in 

the game:

First, as a set of pithy statements that serve as a guide to 
roleplaying, helping to define your investigator and remind 
you how he or she relates to the world.

An investigator is about to encounter the Cthulhu Mythos for the first time.

chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORSSample Occupations

The occupations below are just a sample of the possibilities 
(Chaosium’s  Investigator  Handbook  provides  details  for 
many more). Use these as a guide when creating occupa-
tions not listed here. Occupations important in Lovecraft’s 
stories are noted as [Lovecraftian], while those marked with 
[Modern] are only available for modern-day game settings.
If  creating  a  new  occupation,  confine  the  number 
of skills to eight, otherwise the notion of an occupation 
being  a  concentration  of  knowledge  and  ability  (skills) 
becomes pointless. 

Some occupations, like Hacker, exist only in specific 
settings such as the modern day. You should choose only 
those skills appropriate to the historical setting in which 
your  game  is  taking  place.  If  you’re  unsure  about  this, 
talk to your Keeper.

chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORSSecond, they can be called upon during the investigator 
development  phase  for  the  recovery  of  sanity  points  (see 
Investigator Development Phase, page 94).

Third, and perhaps most importantly of all, the corrup-
tion  of  the  investigator’s  background  mirrors  their  loss  of 
sanity and growing knowledge of the Mythos, as all that was 
once  held  dear  becomes  meaningless.  During  episodes  of 
insanity, or as a result of major wounds, the Keeper may add 
or amend a background entry. Ultimately the investigator’s 
only connections to the world are madness and pain.

When crafting background entries, be specific, 
emotional and emphatic

Try to phrase each entry to emphasize its personal nature. 
For  example, “my  wife”  identifies  the  subject,  but  tells  us 
nothing about the nature of the relationship.

A)  Specify a name. Name the person or place, identify 

the item or concept.

B)  Attach a feeling. Start with positive or negative and 

build from there. 

Make it intense, use love instead of like, use despise instead 
of dislike. Be emphatic; use must in place of would prefer. Try to 
phrase it in a way that makes it personal and meaningful.

Consider  "wife"  as  a  starting  point.  Now  give  her  a 
name,  'My  wife,  Annabel".  Now  be  emotional,  “My 
beloved  wife,  Annabel".  Now  be  emphatic,  "My 
beloved  wife,  Annabel.  I  couldn’t  live  without  her". 
That  short  journey  delivers  a  lot  more  information 
and  context.  Of  course  it  could  have  been  developed 
differently,  consider:  "My  wife  Annabel,  who  makes 
my life a misery", "My poor wife Annabel; if only we 
could have a child together".

Using Random Tables for Inspiration
Sometimes  coming  up  with  background  details  on  the  fly 
can be difficult. The following random tables provide a way 
to quickly determine some background details—you can ei-
ther roll on the tables or simply pick ones that seem suitable, 
or just use the lists for inspiration. 

As appropriate, roll 1D10 on each of the following charts 
to select an entry for each category. Each option has some 
examples  to  get  you  started.  Don’t  feel  constrained  to  use 
what you roll; if it doesn’t mesh with your character concept 
then roll again or choose a different option. However, don’t 
dismiss it out of hand; sometimes something that is at first 
incongruous will add an unexpected but welcome twist to 
a character. 

Above all, be clear that the random tables are there as a 
springboard  for  your  imagination.  Each  dice  roll  will  give 
you something from that realm of life to react to; embrace 
it or reject it, but be sure to react to it and use it to help fuel 
your imagination. Weave the background together to make 
a credible all-round character.

"Dear, did you hear something outside?"

You might be creating a male investigator in his twenties, 
with  no  thought  of  any  family.  Rolling  for ‘significant 
people’ indicates a child. You may not have considered 
that your character has a child, but why not? Becoming 
a  father  may  not  have  been  intentional.  Consider  the 
options;  you  may  have  had  an  affair  with  a  married 
woman,  your  wife  may  have  died  and  your  child  fos-
tered, or you may be happily married with a family.

Personal Description
Think  of  a  distinct  look  that  sums  up  your  investigator’s 
appearance (APP). 

Here are some possibilities (choose rather than roll):

  Rugged 
Pretty 
Smart 
  Dirty 
  Youthful 
Stout 
  Elegant 

Pale 
Rosy 
Stuffy 
  Brawny 
  Strapping 

Handsome

Ideology/Beliefs
Roll 1D10 or pick one of the following. Take the result and 
make it specific and personal to your investigator.

1:  There is a higher power that you worship and pray 
to (e.g. Vishnu, Jesus Christ, Haile Selassie I).
2:  Mankind can do fine without religions (e.g. staunch 

atheist, humanist, secularist).

3:  Science has all the answers. Pick a particular aspect of 
interest (e.g. evolution, cryogenics, space exploration).
4:  A belief in fate (e.g. karma, the class system, superstitious).
5:  Member of a society or secret society (e.g. Freema-

son, Women’s Institute, Anonymous).

6:  There  is  evil  in  society  that  should  be  rooted  out. 
What is this evil? (e.g.  drugs, violence, racism).
7:  The occult (e.g. astrology, spiritualism, tarot).
8:  Politics (e.g.  conservative, socialist, liberal).
9:  “Money is power, and I’m going to get all I can” (e.g. 

greedy, enterprising, ruthless).

10: Campaigner/Activist  (e.g.  feminism,  equal  rights, 

union power).

Significant People
Roll 1D10 or pick one from each of the two lists below. Take 
the result and make it specific and personal to your investi-
gator. Think of a name for these people.

First, who?
1:  Parent (e.g. mother, father, stepmother).
2:  Grandparent  (e.g.  maternal  grandmother,  paternal 

grandfather).

3:  Sibling (e.g. brother, half-brother, stepsister).
4:  Child (son or daughter).
5:  Partner (e.g. spouse, fiancé, lover).
6:  Person  who  taught  you  your  highest  occupational 
skill. Identify the skill and consider who taught you 
(e.g.  a  schoolteacher,  the  person  you  apprenticed 
with, your father).

8:  A famous person. Your idol or hero. You may never 
have even met (e.g. film star, politician, musician).
9:  A  fellow  investigator  in  your  game.  Pick  one  or 

4:  A  place  for  quiet  contemplation  (e.g.  the  library,

Next, roll to determine why that person is so significant 
to you. Not all of these options will mesh with every per-
son, so you may have to roll more than once or simply pick 
something that feels appropriate.

1:  You are indebted to them. How did they help you? 
(e.g.  financially,  they  protected  you  through  hard 
times, got you your first job).

7:  The grave of a significant person. Who? (e.g. a par-

ent, a child, a lover).

8:  Your  family  home  (e.g.  a  country  estate,  a  rented 
flat, the orphanage in which you were raised).
9:  The  place  you  were  happiest  in  your  life  (e.g.  the 
park bench where you first kissed, your university).

2:  They  taught  you  something. What?  (e.g.  a  skill,  to 

10: Your workplace (e.g. the office, library, bank).

love, to be a man).

3:  They give your life meaning. How? (e.g. you aspire 
to be like them, you seek to be with them, you seek 
to make them happy).

4:  You  wronged  them  and  seek  reconciliation.  What 
did you do? (e.g. stole money from them, informed 
the  police  about  them,  refused  to  help  when  they 
were desperate).

5:  Shared  experience.  What?  (e.g.  you  lived  through 
hard  times  together,  you  grew  up  together,  you 
served in the war together).

6:  You  seek  to  prove  yourself  to  them.  How?  (e.g.  by 
getting  a  good  job,  by  finding  a  good  spouse,  by 
getting an education).

7:  You  idolize  them  (e.g.  for  their  fame,  their  beauty, 

their work).

8:  A feeling of regret (e.g. you should have died in their 
place, you fell out over something you said, you didn’t 
step up and help them when you had the chance).
9:  You wish to prove yourself better than them. What 

was their flaw? (e.g. lazy, drunk, unloving).

10: They  have  crossed  you  and  you  seek  revenge.  For 
what do you blame them? (e.g. death of a loved one, 
your financial ruin, marital breakup).

Meaningful Locations

make it specific and personal to your investigator. Think of 
a name for these places.

1:  Your seat of learning (e.g. school, university).
2:  Your  hometown  (e.g.  rural  village,  market  town, 

busy city).

Treasured Possessions
Roll 1D10 or pick one of the following. Take the result and 
make it specific and personal to your investigator.

1:  An item connected with your highest skill (e.g. ex-

pensive suit, false ID, brass knuckles).

2:  An essential item for your occupation (e.g. doctor’s 

bag, car, lock picks).

3:  A  memento  from  your  childhood  (e.g.  comics, 

pocketknife, lucky coin).

photograph in your wallet, a letter).

5:  Something given to you by your Significant Person 

(e.g. a ring, a diary, a map).

6:  Your collection. What is it? (e.g. bus tickets, stuffed 

animals, records).

you seek answers (e.g. a letter you found in a cupboard 
written in an unknown language, a curious pipe of un-
known origin found among your late father’s effects, a 
curious silver ball you dug up in your garden).
8:  A sporting item (e.g. cricket bat, a signed baseball, a 

fishing rod).

9:  A  weapon  (e.g.  service  revolver,  your  old  hunting 

rifle, the hidden knife in your boot).

Call of CthulhuTraits

make it specific and personal to your investigator.

1:  Generous  (e.g.  generous  tipper,  always  helps  out  a 

person in need, philanthropist).

2:  Good  with  animals  (e.g.  loves  cats,  grew  up  on  a 

farm, good with horses).

3:  Dreamer  (e.g.  given  to  flights  of  fancy,  visionary, 

highly creative).

4:  Hedonist (e.g. life and soul of the party, entertaining 

drunk, "live fast and die young").

5:  Gambler and a risk-taker (e.g. poker-faced, try any-

thing once, lives on the edge).

Additional Details
Fill in the following details on the investigator sheet.

Birthplace 

Most of Lovecraft’s stories take place in New England. You can 
choose to start there if you wish; however your investigator 
could originate from anywhere in the world. No game penalty 
or advantage exists for one country or culture over another. 
The choice can lead to other deductions: for instance, while 
an investigator born in the United States of America or Can-
ada has a good chance of English as his or her own language, 
an investigator born in Quebec might learn French at infancy, 
while one born in Arizona might have Spanish or Navajo, and 
one born in San Francisco might speak Cantonese.

6:  Good cook (e.g. bakes wonderful cakes, can make a 

Gender of the Investigator 

meal from almost nothing, refined palate).

7:  Ladies’ man/seductress (e.g. suave, charming voice, 

enchanting eyes).

8:  Loyal (e.g. stands by his or her friends, never breaks 

a promise, would die for his or her beliefs).

9:  A good reputation (e.g. the best after-dinner speaker 
in the country, the most pious of men, fearless in the 
face of danger).

10: Ambitious  (e.g.  to  achieve  a  goal,  to  become  the 

boss, to have it all). 

Key Background Connection 
Consider your investigator’s background, and pick the one 
entry that you feel is most important. This is their key con-
nection: the one thing above all else that gives meaning to 
their life. Mark it with star or underline it on the investigator 
sheet. This connection can aid your investigator in regaining 
Sanity points (see Chapter 8: Sanity). 

Everything in the story is open to the Keeper to do with 
as  he  or  she  desires,  except  for  the  investigator’s  key  con-
nection. The key connection cannot be destroyed, killed or 
taken away by the Keeper without first allowing the player 
the opportunity to roll dice to, in some way, save that key 
connection.

The  idea  of  the  players  being  able  to  nominate  some-
thing  in  the  game  world  that  has  immunity  may  sound 
daunting  (to  the  Keeper)  at  first.  However,  this  immunity 
is quite limited; the key connection can be killed, removed 
or  destroyed  by  the  Keeper,  but  the  investigator  to  whom 
they are connected must be involved, or given the option to 
become  involved.  In  game  play  this  means  that  the  player 
must be presented with the opportunity to make at least one 
dice roll to save the connection.

Losing one’s key connection during play requires a Sani-

ty roll (1/1D6 Sanity point loss, see Chapter 8: Sanity).

The  investigator  can  be  male  or  female.  No  game  rule 
distinguishes between male and female; neither sex has an 
advantage  over  the  other.  Players  are  encouraged  to  play 
either sex based upon their preference rather than tactical 
considerations. Some published scenarios may consider the 
effect of gender in specific societies and historical periods.

Name

The  name  of  the  investigator  is  whatever  the  player  finds 
entertaining  or  evocative.  Fashions  in  names  change  over 
the decades, and certain names may fit one historical period 
and setting better than others. 

Picture 

A  space  exists  on  the  investigator  sheet  for  you  to  draw  a 
picture of your investigator. If you prefer, you could cut out 
a  suitable  portrait  from  a  magazine  or  print  one  from  the 
Internet. It’s a useful way to introduce your investigator to the 
other players. Even a small picture can say a lot. 

Step Five: Equip the  
Investigator 
Your investigator’s day-to-day living standards are dictated 
by the Credit Rating score. The likelihood of owning major 
possessions,  such  as  a  house  and  a  car,  are  also  indicated 
by the Credit Rating score. The Keeper will advise on what 
other equipment an investigator may start out with. A player 
may buy additional items, if available for purchase.

Cash and Assets
The  following  amounts,  in  US  dollars,  by  period,  denote 
the wealth of an investigator. Cash is readily available to the 
investigator, whereas wealth that is tied up in assets can only 
be spent if time is taken to realize the capital.

chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORSLiving Standards

Credit Rating 0: Penniless
A person that cannot even afford the level of ‘poor‘ is considered penniless.
Accommodation: such a person would be living on the street.
Travel: walking, hitchhiking or stowing away on a train or ship.

Credit Rating 1-9: Poor
Able to afford the bare minimum of a roof over their head and at least one 
meager meal each day. 
Accommodation: restricted to the cheapest rental housing or fleabag hotel.
Travel: public transport of the cheapest sort. Any transport possessed will be 
cheap and unreliable.

Credit Rating 10-49: Average
A reasonable level of comfort, three meals a day and occasional treat.
Accommodation: an average home or apartment, either rented or privately 
owned. Expect to stay in moderately priced hotels.
Travel: standard forms of travel can be used, but not first class. In a mod-
ern-day period, this person would be likely to own a reliable car.

Credit Rating 50-89: Wealthy
This level of wealth affords luxury and comfort.
Accommodation: a substantial residence, perhaps with some domestic help 
(butler, housekeeper, cleaner, gardener, etc.) Possibly a second home in the 
country or abroad. Stay in expensive hotels.
Travel: first class. This person would own an expensive car or equivalent.

Credit Rating 90+: Rich
This level of wealth affords great luxury and comfort.
Accommodation: a plush residence or estate with abundant domestic help (but-
ler, servants, cleaner, gardener, etc.). Second homes in the country and abroad. 
Stay in top hotels.
Travel: first class. In the modern day this person would own numerous luxury 
cars.
There is no requirement to make any account for accommodation, food or inciden-
tal travel expenses so long as an investigator’s spending falls within the bounds of 
his or her living standard. Refer to Table II: Cash and Assets if the investigator 
wishes to make more significant purchases.

Credit Rating 99: Super Rich
As Rich, but money is really no object. Individuals in this category are among 
the richest in the world.

46 

Cross  reference  the  investigator’s 
Credit Rating with the period to deter-
mine the investigator’s available cash, 
assets and spending level.

Notes:

Cash:  Not  necessarily  carried  on 
the person. The Keeper may ask where 
it is being kept. For example, if the in-
vestigator is traveling abroad, are they 
keeping it in a money belt or is there 
someone  back  home  who  can  wire 
money to them when requested. This 
will have an impact if the investigator 
is robbed or loses their gear. 

Spending  Level:  This  is  an  arbi-
trary amount below which, for ease of 
play,  no  record  keeping  is  required. A 
character  can  spend  up  to  his  or  her 
spending  level  with  no  expenditure 
of  cash.  In  theory  an  investigator 
could  spend  an  amount  just  below 
their  spending  level  every  day,  but  in 
practice  it  should  be  used  only  occa-
sionally—if  the  Keeper  feels  a  player 
is exploiting this financial abstraction, 
a  use  of  assets  may  be  called  for.  The 
spending levels exist purely to ease the 
flow of the game; no one wants to track 
every penny.

Assets:  Assets  are  the  things  that 
your  investigator  owns  at  the  start  of 
play  and  the  dollar  amount  on  the 
chart is the total value of those things. 
The  player  should  note  down  the 
dollar amount and decide the form it 
takes, usually property or investments, 
or  perhaps  shares  in  a  business.    The 
standard list of possessions is included 
within  the  various  brackets  of  living 
standards.  If  your 
living  standard 
includes a house and car, those things 
constitute a part of your asset value.

Equipment
The final step is to write down any im-
portant  items,  weapons  or  equipment 
your 
investigator  possesses.  There’s 
no  need  to  write  a  detailed  list  of 
everything  your  character  owns—just 
list  the  notable  items.  In  many  cases, 
starting  investigators  don’t  really  have 
anything exceptional or worth writing 
down in the way of equipment—that’s 
fine  as  you’ll  soon  be  uncovering  all 
manner  of  strange  and  remarkable 
items  during  the  game.  Items  that  fit

investigator 
if  your 
takes  no  weapons,  he  or  she 
may still use them. Perhaps your 
investigator  served  in  a  war,  or 
gained  some  familiarity  with 
knives  or  guns  while  growing 
up on a farm. Few people in any 
era  are  expert  with  weapons, 
though  often  they  have  passing 
acquaintance with them. Except 
for  a  few  occupations  like  Sol-
dier,  additional  skill  points  for 
Fighting and Firearms normally 
come  out  of  personal  interest 
skill points. 

Refer to the Equipment lists 
(pages 396-400) and Table XVII: 
Weapons (pages 401-405).

Other Ways 
of  Creating 
Investigators
The  bottom  line  in  creating  an 
investigator is that you generate 
a  set  of  characteristics  that  fit 
within the appropriate range of 
values.  The  method  you  use  is 
secondary  to  this,  and  different 
groups  will  agree  on  different 
methods. Some prefer a random 
approach;  others  prefer  varying 
degrees of freedom to exchange 
or  modify  the  values,  perhaps 
with  a  view  to  fitting  the  char-
acteristics  to  a  preconceived 
character template, or to fit their 
perception of game balance.

For  these  reasons,  a  selection 
of  alternative  methods  for  creat-
ing  investigators  are  listed  below. 
The  Keeper  should  discuss  and 
decide which method or combination of methods for creating 
investigators best suits his or her group.

Option 1: Start Over
Use the default method. If you don’t like your dice rolls then 
scrap them and start again. The Keeper may allow the use of 
this option whenever a player rolls three or more character-
istics that begin below 50.

Option 2: Modifying Low Rolls
Use the default method. If you feel there are too many low 
rolls  (perhaps  three  or  more  under  10),  roll  an  additional 
1D6 and share out the extra points among the lowest dice 
rolls before multiplying by 5.

47 

chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORSOption 3: Choosing Where to Place 
Rolled Characteristics
Roll and record five rolls of 3D6 and three rolls of 2D6+6. 
Multiply each of these eight results by 5.

Allocate the characteristic values as you wish among the 
eight  characteristics.  There  is  a  recommended  minimum 
value of 40 for INT and SIZ, although these may be lower, 
with the Keeper’s agreement.

Option 4: Point Buy Characteristics
Share  460  points  among  the  eight  characteristics  as  you 
wish (within the 15 to 90 range). There is a recommended 
minimum value of 40 for INT and SIZ, although these may 
be lower with the Keeper’s agreement, and no characteristic 
can be lower than 15.

Option 5: Quick Fire Method 
This  method  is  recommended  if  you  wish  to  get  up  and 
running quickly. 

G  Allocate 40, 50, 50, 50, 60, 60, 70, 80 where you like 

among your characteristics.

G  Apply age and EDU modifiers (see page 32).
G  Figure Damage Bonus and Build (see page 33).
G  Figure  Hit  Points  (CON+SIZ  divided  by  10)  and 

Luck (3D6 × 5).

G  Decide an occupation and select eight appropriate 

occupation skills.

G  Allocate  the  following  values  among  the  eight  oc-
cupation skills and Credit Rating: one at 70%, two 
at 60%, three at 50% and three at 40% (assign the 
skills  directly  to  these  values  and  ignore  the  skill 
base values). If your chosen profession states a low-
er Credit Rating skill than 40%, you should set an 

appropriate Credit Rating skill value and distribute 
the excess points elsewhere.

G  Pick four non-occupation skills and boost them by 

20% (adding 20 to the skill base values). 

G  Roll  for  background  details  then  elaborate  upon 

them later, during play.

G  Start Playing.
G  Fill in half and fifth values during play.
G  Sort out money if and when you need it.

Option 6: Reaching the Heights of 
Human Potential
You may have noticed that many characteristics have a max-
imum of 99, but the dice rolls only allow for a maximum 
score of 90. If you wish to allow for truly exceptional inves-
tigators, allow an extra 1D10 percentage points to distribute 
as the players' wish among the characteristics. That way, an 
investigator with INT 90 can boost it to 99 with a roll of 9 
on the die. 

This option can be used in combination with any other 

method.

Optional Rule: A Cap on 
Starting Skill Values
Investigators  having  high  skills  should  not  unbalance  the 
game,  given  that  some  skill  rolls  will  require  them  to  roll 
under  a  half  or  a  fifth  of  their  skill.  Likewise  even  a  99% 
Fighting skill can be dodged or fought back against (and a 
roll of 100 is always a failure).

If you feel that high skills are a concern for your group then 

simply apply an upper limit for starting skills, such as 75%.

chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORS50 

Call of Cthulhu51 

chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORShis chapter looks at skills in detail, providing 
definitions  of  their  use  and  scope  within  the 
game.  Each  category  of  skill  encompasses  a 
range  of  possibilities  and,  to  ensure  brevity, 
descriptions have to be general summaries of 
intent and coverage. 

Skill Definitions
Skills  represent  what  is  known  within  a  certain  era,  and 
some  skills  are  tagged  [Modern]  to  denote  that  they  can 
only be used in modern-day settings. Some skills are given 
a  generic  name,  which  may  not  be  appropriate  for  some 
settings; for example, Drive Auto would not be suitable for 
a  game  set  in Victorian  London,  and  should  be  reworded 
appropriately—in this case as Drive Carriage.

Skill percentiles are not proportions of what is hypothet-
ically  knowable.  If  they  were  able  to  stack  their  respective 
knowledge on a table like poker chips and measure the dif-
ference, a physicist of 60% in the modern day knows much 
more than a physicist of 90% skill in 1910. 

Equally, some skills would be affected by location. A Jap-
anese investigator might have a Law skill of 75% in Japan; 
however if the same investigator were tested on Spanish law 
then the Keeper would probably increase the level of diffi-
culty of the roll.

A skill level of 50% is high enough to let a character eke 
out a living from it. If an investigator rises high in a skill un-
related to their profession, player and Keeper could confer 
about changing the investigator to a new profession.

Specific  situations  that  arise  in  your  game  will  require 
the Keeper to make judgments about how to apply the rules 
regarding  skill  use.  Some  suggestions  on  how  to  use  the 
skills  in  specific  circumstances  are  given  under  individual 
skills. This use of suggestions is to encourage the Keeper to 
make judgments rather than referring to a host of spot rules.
Certain skills embody a wide range of knowledge, such 
as Art and Craft, Fighting, Firearms, and Science, allowing 
investigators to specialize in narrower avenues of learning.

Some of  the skills detailed below are termed [Uncom-
mon]  and  are  not  included  on  the  standard  investigator 
sheet (Artillery, Demolitions, Hypnosis, Read Lips, etc.). If 
the Keeper wishes to include these extra skills in the game, 
or if a player wishes to take one, this should be made clear. 
The  Keeper  may  introduce  other  skills  depending  on  the 
setting and period; for example, if one were to set a game 
in the far future on an alien planet then various new skills 
might be devised.

Skill Specializations
Some broad skills are broken into specializations. A player 
may spend skill points to purchase any skill specialization. 
The  generic  skill  cannot  be  purchased.  Thus  a  player  may 
spend  points  in  Fighting  (Brawl)  or  Fighting  (Spear)  but 
not simply Fighting.

Skill Points:
What Do They Mean?

General level of ability  
by skill value:

01%–05%: Novice: complete amateur.

06%–19%:  Neophyte:  beginner  with  a  small 
amount of knowledge.

20%–49%: Amateur: possesses some talent or rudi-
mentary training (hobby level).

50%–74%:  Professional:  allows  a  character  to  eke 
out a living from the skill. Equivalent to a bachelor’s 
degree in a specific subject.

75%–89%:  Expert:  advanced  expertise.  Corre-
sponds with a master’s degree or Ph.D.

90%+: Master: among the world’s best in the skill.

In the case of Art and Craft, Science, and Survival, these skills 
encompass  a  wide  diversity  of  specializations.  The  Keeper 
must decide on the applicability of a particular specialization 
to the situation in hand. Depending on the specific situation, 
the Keeper may allow the use of an alternate specialization at 
an increased level of difficulty if the Keeper agrees that there 
is sufficient overlap with that specialization. 

Among  the  specializations  there  are  often  transferable 
skills and knowledge. At the end of this chapter you will find 
an optional rule for the transferable skill benefit.

The  investigators  are  trying  to  crack  a  numerical 
code.  The  Keeper  calls  for  a  Cryptography  skill  roll. 
A  player  lacking  Cryptography  asks  if  they  can  use 
their  Mathematics  skill  instead.  The  Keeper  allows 
the  roll  at  an  increased  level  of  difficulty.  A  Regular 
success was required when using Cryptography (a roll 
equal to or under the skill), so a Hard success (a roll 
equal to or under half the skill) is required when using 
Mathematics in its place.

Opposing Skill/Difficulty Level
For  each  skill,  entry  notes  are  provided  for  which  skill  (if 
any)  works  in  opposition,  and  suggestions  given  for  what 
constitutes a Regular and Hard difficulty level. The Regular 
difficulty level (requiring a roll of equal to or below the skill 
value) is the default roll. Where things are significantly more 
difficult, a Hard difficulty level (requiring a roll of equal to 
or  below  half  of  the  skill  value)  may  be  required.  Rarely 

54 

Call of Cthulhu 
Pushing Skills
For each skill, a number of examples are provided for what 
might constitute a "pushed roll" (see page 84 for Pushing the 
Roll), and also some of the possible consequences for failing 
a  pushed  roll.  The  suggestions  given  should  be  viewed  as 
simply that—suggestions. The latitude for what could jus-
tify a pushed roll is wide, and should be best determined by 
actions, motivations, and events within the game. Likewise, 
the consequences of a failed pushed roll will be best served if 
inspiration is drawn from current game events, non-player 
characters, and the game world. 

Likewise, where appropriate, an example is provided for 
a possible consequence of an investigator pushing a skill roll 
while  insane.  The  very  fact  that  the  investigator  is  insane 
while performing a task heightens the stakes for the roll, as 
the  consequences  of  a  pushed  failure  will  often  be  all  the 
more extreme (or bizarre).

The  examples  merely  provide  ideas,  and  it  is  intended 
that  both  players  and  Keepers  fashion  their  own  justifica-
tions and consequences as appropriate to their games and 
playing styles. 

Combined Skill Rolls
In  some  situations  the  Keeper  may  ask  for  a  roll  against 
more than one skill. Only one dice roll is made; the result 
is then compared with each of the skills named. The Keeper 
will specify whether a success is required for both skills or if 
only one of the skills need be successful.

A deranged cultist suddenly draws a gun on Harvey. 
The  Keeper  asks  for  either  a  Spot  Hidden  roll  or  a 
Psychology roll from Harvey. A success on either will 
allow Harvey to anticipate the attacker’s action, and 
perhaps give Harvey a chance to act first. A successful 
Spot  Hidden  would  allow  him  to  see  the  gun  being 
drawn  by  the  cultist,  while  a  successful  Psychology 
would allow Harvey to anticipate the cultist’s aggres-
sive intent.

Later,  Harvey  attempts  to  repair  an  electric  tur-
bine.  The  item  is  both  mechanical  and  electrical,  so 
the  Keeper  asks  for  a  combined  Mechanical  Repair 
and Electrical Repair roll. One roll is made, and the 
result  is  compared  to  both  skills—in  this  case  both 
must be successful to achieve the task.

Note the importance of using a single dice roll in 
the latter example. Harvey has only 10% skill in both 
Mechanical Repair and Electrical Repair. His chance 
of success when making one dice roll and comparing 
it to both skills simultaneously is 10%. If he were to 
make  two  successive  rolls,  first  against  Mechanical 
Repair and then against Electrical Repair, his chance 
of succeeding both would be reduced to 1%. 

Harvey attempts to repair an electric turbine.

should the Extreme difficulty level (requiring a roll of equal 
to or below one-fifth of the skill value) be called for—only 
in  the  most  extreme  and  dire  situations.  Sometimes  this 
may  be  simply  that  the  performance  of  the  skill  is  greatly 
hindered, such as when being shot at or pursued, or when 
conditions are uniquely appalling.

Some examples of where an Extreme difficulty might be 

called for include:

Demolitions:  to  defuse  an  explosive  device  of  a  radically 
different design to any seen before, perhaps of futuristic or 
alien origin.

Electrical Repair: working on futuristic or alien technology 
that uses a form of electronics.

Listen:  Eavesdropping  on  a  quiet  conversation  in  an  ex-
tremely noisy environment.

Locksmith: Opening a high security lock with only a piece 
of wire (i.e. no tools); crack open the most secure of bank 
vaults.

Medicine: Diagnosis and treatment of strange, new, or alien 
medical ailments.

Psychology:  Read  someone’s  intent  or  determine  that  a 
person is lying if their relevant opposing skill (Intimidate, 
Fast Talk, Persuade, or Charm) is 90% or above.

Call of CthulhuAccounting (05%)
Grants  understanding  of  accountancy  procedures  and 
reveals  the  financial  functioning  of  a  business  or  person. 
Inspecting the books, one might detect cheated employees, 
siphoned-off  funds,  payment  of  bribes  or  blackmail,  and 
whether  the  financial  condition  is  better  or  worse  than 
claimed. Looking through old accounts, one could see how 
money was gained or lost in the past (grain, slave-trading, 
whiskey-running, etc.) and to whom and for what payment 
was made. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
If someone were trying to conceal something, the difficulty 
level  would  be  based  upon  the  Accountancy  skill  of  the 
person doing the concealing.

i  Regular  difficulty:  comprehensive  and  well-docu-

Anthropology (01%) 
Enables the user to identify and understand an individual’s 
way  of  life  through  observation.  If  the  skill-user  observes 
another  culture  from  within  for  a  time,  or  works  from 
accurate records concerning an extinct culture, then simple 
predictions can be made about that culture’s ways and mor-
als, even though the evidence may be incomplete. Studying 
the culture for a month or more, the anthropologist begins 
to understand how the culture functions and, in combina-
tion with Psychology, may predict the actions and beliefs of 
those being studied. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
The difficulty for this skill is set according to the exposure of 
the skill-user to their subject.

i  Regular difficulty: spending a month or more with 

mented set of account books.

the people.

i  Hard difficulty: disorganized and partial accounts.

i  Hard  difficulty  level:  spending  only  a  week  or  less 

Pushing examples: taking more time to review documents; 
visiting  banks  or  businesses  to  validate  findings;  dou-
ble-checking the math and data.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: discussions 
between  investigators  and  third  parties  alert  some  enemy 
faction  to  the  investigators’  intentions;  a  vital  part  of  the 
accounts is destroyed or lost (perhaps in their tired state the 
investigator spills coffee over them).

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 

might be found having partially eaten the accounts.

Animal Handling (05%)[Uncommon]
The ability to command and train domesticated animals to 
perform simple tasks. The skill is most commonly applied to 
dogs but may include birds, cats, monkeys, and so on (at the 
Keeper’s discretion). For riding animals, such as horses  or 
camels, the Ride skill is used for breaking in and controlling 
such mounts.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

with the people. 

Pushing examples: taking more time to study the target/s; 
going “native”  for  a  period;  taking  an  active  role  in  a  cer-
emony, rite, etc.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  being  at-
tacked  or  imprisoned  by  the  people  studied,  due  to  some 
perceived  transgression  of  their  laws  or  social  mores;  suf-
fering  severe  side-effects  as  the  result  of  being  involved  in 
a ceremony which involved ingesting psychotropic plants.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
will  be  lost  among  the  culture  being  studied,  for  example 
like Dennis Hopper’s photojournalist character in the film 
Apocalypse Now.

Appraise (01%)
Used to estimate the value of a particular item, including the 
quality,  material  used,  and  workmanship.  Where  relevant, 
the skill-user could pinpoint the age of the item, assess its 
historical relevance, and detect forgeries.

i  Regular difficulty: getting a trained dog to sit, fetch, 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

or attack on command.

i  Hard difficulty: getting an untrained or unfamiliar 

dog to perform a task on command.

Pushing examples: taking greater personal risk, in terms of 
getting closer to, or directly handling the animal.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the animal 
attacks the trainer or someone else nearby, most likely caus-
ing damage; the animal escapes.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
might be found behaving like the animal they were trying 
to control.

i  Regular  difficulty:  an  item  that  was  not  rare  at  its 
time  of  manufacture,  and  is  made  of  a  common 
material (e.g. 50 year-old gold watch).

i  Hard difficulty: an unusual item, perhaps made of 
uncommon  materials  (e.g.  a  foreign-made  object 
of several hundred years in age, such as an ancient 
tome).

Pushing examples: checking an item’s validity with another 
expert; conducting testing; researching an item.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: accidentally 
ruining the item in question; bringing the item to the atten-
tion of other people, leading to its theft; activating whatever 
function the item might serve.

57 

chapter 4: skillsIf  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
could destroy the item, believing it to be cursed; alternative-
ly they regard the item as their personal salvation and refuse 
to give it up to anyone else.

Archaeology (01%)
Allows dating and identification of artifacts from past cul-
tures, and the detection of fakes. Ensures expertise in setting 
up and excavating a dig site. On inspecting a site, the user 
might deduce the purposes and way of life of those who left 
the  remains. Anthropology  might  aid  in  this. Archaeology 
also helps identify written forms of extinct human languag-
es.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular  difficulty:  sufficient  time  and  resources  to 

do the job properly.

i  Hard  difficulty:  a  lack  of  time  and/or  limited  re-

sources.

Pushing examples: taking more time to study the site or item; 
conducting further research; consulting another expert.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: The site is 
spoiled, with finds ruined through incompetence, vandalism 
or  theft;  some  higher  authority  seizes  the  site  or  the  finds 
from your control; publicity leads to the finds being stolen.
If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
keeps digging deeper, ever deeper—the truth is down there 
somewhere.

Art and Craft (Specializations) (05%)
The investigator sheet contains blank spaces for specializa-
tions of this skill. For example: 

i  Acting
i  Barber
i  Calligraphy
i  Carpenter
i  Cook
i  Dancer
i  Fine Art
i  Forgery

i  Writer
i  Morris Dancer
i  Opera Singer
i  Painter and Decorator
i  Photographer
i  Potter
i  Sculptor
i  Vacuum-Tube Blower

Many  of  these  examples  are  skills  directly  linked  to  a 
profession,  but  the  skill  may  just  be  a  leisure  pursuit. You 
may spend skill points to purchase any skill specialization. 
The generic "Art and Craft" skill cannot be purchased.

This skill may enable the making or repair of an item—
typically requiring equipment and time, to be determined 
by the Keeper, if necessary. In a situation where graduations 
of  success  might  be  appropriate,  a  higher  level  of  success 
indicates the item made is of high quality and/or precision.

"These aren't any hieroglyphs that I know of."

An art or craft skill might also be used to make a dupli-
cate or fake item. In such a case, the difficulty level would 
depend on the intricacy and distinctiveness of the original 
to be copied. In the case of faking documentation, a specific 
specialization (Forgery) is used.

A  successful  roll  might  provide  information  about 
an item, such as where or when it might have been made, 
some  point  of  history  or  technique  concerning  it,  or  who 
might have made it. The holder of a specialism would have a 
breadth of knowledge within a particular field—knowledge 
of the subject, its history and contemporary practitioners, as 
well as the ability to perform it.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: making a standard, saleable item.
i  Hard difficulty: making a higher quality or particu-

larly intricate piece.

Pushing examples: reworking the object, piece or compo-
sition  from  scratch;  conducting  further  research;  checking 
with another expert.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  A  vast 
amount  of  time  and  money  is  wasted  in  creating  a  failed 
attempt;  the  audience  or  customer  is  highly  offended  or 
physically injured by some aspect of your work; the critics 
slam your work, and no one desires your services any longer.
If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
creates a transgressive work that shocks and causes violent 
reactions  in  the  viewer—perhaps  only  the  most  decadent 
could appreciate it.

Call of CthulhuExamples of Art and Craft Specializations

Acting (05%):  The  performer  is  trained  in  theatrical  and/
or  film  acting  (in  the  modern  era,  this  may  also  include 
television), able to adopt a persona, memorize scripts and 
utilize  stage/movie  make-up  to  alter  their  appearance.  See 
Disguise (page 62).

Fine  Art  (05%):  The  artist  is  accomplished  in  the  art  of 
painting  (oils,  acrylic,  watercolor),  as  well  as  sketching  in 
pencil, crayon or pastels. While serious works of art might 
take many days or months to complete, the artist may quick-
ly sketch accurate impressions, objects and people. The skill 
also denotes a familiarity with the art world, and the artist 
may  be  able  to  determine  a  particular  artist’s  work,  their 
school and known history.

Forgery (05%): Adept  at  fine  detail,  the  user  can  produce 
high quality fake documents, be it a person’s handwriting, a 
bureaucratic form or permit, or a duplicate of a tome. The 
forger will require suitable materials (inks, grades of paper, 
etc.) as well as an original from which to copy. 

A successful roll indicates the forgery will pass a normal, 
cursory inspection. Someone spending time and thoroughly 
examining the forgery would use the Appraise skill (opposed 
by the original forger’s skill) when determining if the fake 
can be spotted.

Photography (05%): Covers both still and motion photog-
raphy.  This  skill  allows  one  to  take  clear  pictures,  develop 
them properly and enhance half-hidden detail. 

In  the  1920s,  the  user  is  able  to  prepare  the  necessary 

chemicals to make flashpowder.

In the present day, the skill extends to cover video cam-
eras,  video  playback  equipment,  digital  photography  and 
digital editing, where the user is adept at the manipulation 
of digital images. Radically different versions can be created 
from an original source, such as changing the location of a 
person in a photograph, who they are with and what they 
are doing. Those proficient may also be able to detect when 
an image has been manipulated.

Regular snapshots do not require a skill roll. Rolls would 
be  required  to  achieve  effective  candid  photographs,  or 
shots  that  capture  fine  detail—especially  at  long  range,  at 
speed or in low light. This skill can also allow the investiga-
tor to determine if a photograph has been tampered with or 
fabricated, as well as the angle and position from which a 
photograph was taken.

Artillery (01%) [Uncommon]
This skill assumes some form of military training and ex-
perience. The user is experienced in the operation of field 
weapons in warfare: able to work in a crew or "detachment" 
to  operate  the  projection  of  munitions  beyond  the  range 
of personal weapons. Many weapons of this nature are too 
large for a single person to operate, and either an individual 
cannot use the weapon without a crew or the difficulty level 
should be raised (at the Keeper’s discretion, dependent on 
the type of weapon employed).

Various  specializations  exist,  depending  on  the  period 
setting of the game, including cannon, howitzer, mortar and 
rocket launcher.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: if the artillery is well maintained 

and used in favorable conditions.

i  Hard difficulty: if the artillery is poorly maintained 

or used in a rush and/or while under fire.

Note: as a combat skill, this cannot be pushed.

Charm (15%)
Charm  takes  many  forms,  including  physical  attraction, 
seduction, flattery or simply warmth of personality. Charm 
may  be  used  to  compel  someone  to  act  in  a  certain  way, 
but  not  in  a  manner  completely  contrary  to  that  person’s 
normal behavior. Charm is opposed by the Charm or Psy-
chology skills.

Charm may be used for bargaining, to haggle the price 
of an item or service down. If successful, the seller is won 
over and they may well reduce the price a little.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
See  Charm,  Fast  Talk,  Intimidate  and  Persuade  Skills: 
Difficulty Levels, page 93. 

Pushing examples: overtly flattering the target with affec-
tion; presenting an expensive gift; building trust by impart-
ing a secret. 

Remember this is about being charming. If the investi-
gator begins to take an alternative approach the Keeper may 
ask for a different skill to be used. If threats are used, it may 
become Intimidation; or if a protracted discussion ensues, it 
may become Persuasion. Switching from one to the other to 
gain a second roll still constitutes a Pushed roll.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll:  the  target 
takes offence and will have nothing further to do with you; 
the target is associated in some way with your enemies and, 
while  they  may  play  along  with  you,  they  also  inform  on 
you; a third party intercedes to prevent you from chatting 
up their girl.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she falls 
head over heels in love with their target and will act as if the 
target had successfully used a Dominate spell (see Chapter 
12: Grimoire) upon them.

Climb (20%) 
This skill allows a character to climb trees, walls and other 
vertical  surfaces  with  or  without  ropes  and  climbing  gear. 
The skill also encompasses rappeling.

Conditions such as firmness of surface, available handholds, 

wind, visibility, rain, etc., may all affect the difficulty level. 

Failing this skill on the first roll indicates that the climb 
is  perhaps  beyond  the  investigator’s  capability.  Failing  a 
pushed roll is likely to indicate a fall with resultant damage. 
One successful Climb roll should allow the investigator to 
complete the climb in almost all cases (rather than requiring 

59 

chapter 4: skillsInterpersonal Skills:  
Disambiguation
The relative values in the Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate, and Persuade 
skills serve to define a character and how they interact with people. 

It is not for the player to nominate which one of these four skills 
they are using in a given situation. Instead the player should describe 
what  their  investigator  is  doing  and  saying,  and  it  is  then  up  to  the 
Keeper to decide which of the four skills is appropriate.

T  If the investigator is threatening violence or acting aggressively,  

the skill is Intimidate.

T  If the investigator is attempting to befriend or seduce, the skill 

is Charm.

T  If the investigator is using rational arguments and debate over a 

prolonged time, the skill is Persuade.

T  If the investigator is acting quickly to deceive, con, or trick, the 

skill is Fast Talk.

When Used on Player Characters
Each player (normally) has only one investigator through which they 
act in the game; it would therefore not be fair to allow one player to 
dictate  the  actions  of  another  player’s  investigator.  However,  if  one 
player wishes to put pressure on another player’s investigator to do their 
bidding, they might use violence (combat rules) or their investigator’s 
social skills. The former could inflict damage and ultimately death; the 
latter is subtler. 

When one of these four skills is successfully used on an investigator 
(either by an NPC or another investigator), the player is not compelled 
to follow the wishes of the other party. If the player refuses to act in 
accordance with the wishes of the character who is coercing them, the 
latter can inflict one penalty die on one dice roll (of the coercer’s choice) 
made by the player of the coerced investigator. This penalty die need 
not be applied to the very next dice roll, but does not last indefinitely. 
Only one penalty die can be held by one character against any other 
single character at a time.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a 
Pushed  roll:  fall  and  suffer  damage 
(1D6 damage per ten feet onto grass, or 
1D10 damage per 10 feet onto concrete); 
lose a valuable possession as it falls from 
your  pocket  (you  may  not  notice  this 
until later); become stranded, unable to 
go up or down.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a 
pushed roll, he or she holds on for dear 
life and screams at the top of their lungs 
for as long as they can.

Computer Use (05%) 
[Modern]
This skill allows the investigator to pro-
gram  in  various  computer  languages; 
retrieve and analyze obscure data; break 
into  a  secured  system;  explore  a  com-
plicated  network;  or  detect  or  exploit 
intrusions,  back  doors,  and  viruses. 
Special  manipulation  of  a  computer 
system may require this roll.

The  Internet  places  a  wealth  of  in-
formation at the fingertips of an investi-
gator. Use of the Internet to find highly 
specific  and/or  obscure  information 
may  require  a  combined  dice  roll  for 
Computer Use and Library Use.

This  skill  is  not  needed  to  use 
computers  when  surfing  the  Internet, 
collecting email or to run regular com-
mercially available software. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
i  Regular  difficulty:  write,  analyze 
and debug a computer program.
i Hard difficulty: decipher and hack 
into  a  secure  network  without  being 
identified or traced.

Pushing examples: taking longer to de-
velop  a  program;  using  another’s  code 
as  a  shortcut;  using  untested  software 
(e.g. a virus) to exploit a system.

repeated rolls). A challenging or longer climb should have 
an increased difficulty level.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular  difficulty:  plenty  of  handholds;  perhaps  a 

rope or drainpipe to climb.

i  Hard  difficulty:  few  handholds,  or  surfaces  slick 

with rain.

Pushing  examples:  reassessing  the  climb;  taking  a  longer 
route; straining one’s reach.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a 
Pushed  roll:  accidentally  erasing  the  sought-after  files, 
or  even  corrupting  the  whole  system;  leaving  evidence  or 
alerting  others  through  your  actions;  infesting  your  own 
computer/network with a virus.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she is 
lost in cyberspace, and it will require physical intervention 
to get the person to stop using the computer or look away 
from the screen.

Call of CthulhuCredit Rating (0%)
A  measure  of  how  prosperous  and  financially  confident 
the  investigator  appears  to  be.  Money  opens  doors;  if  the 
investigator is attempting to use his or her financial status 
to achieve a goal then use of the Credit Rating skill may be 
appropriate. Credit Rating can be used in place of APP to 
gauge first impressions.

Credit Rating is not so much a skill as a gauge of financial 
wealth, and should not be ticked as other skills are. A high 
Credit Rating can be a useful resource in play, and so should 
be paid for with skill points when creating an investigator. 
Each occupation has a starting range for Credit Rating, and 
skill points should be spent to achieve a rating therein. 

Call of Cthulhu is not a game that requires money to be 
carefully tracked; however, it is useful to know the bounds of 
an investigator’s financial reach—for example, can the inves-
tigator afford to employ a team of archaeologists 
and workers to excavate an Egyptian tomb? 
An  investigator’s  Credit  Rating  can 
change  over  time.  Investigators  of 
the Cthulhu Mythos are prone to 
insanity,  and  this  may  lead  to 
loss of employment and thus 
a  lowering  of  the  investiga-
tor’s  Credit  Rating  score. 
See  Credit  Rating  and 
Investigator Expenditure 
(page  95)  for  a  more 
in-depth  study  of  Credit 
Rating and its use.

skill/Difficulty 

i  Regular 

difficulty: 
loan  from 

getting  a 
a  bank  or  business; 
bypassing  a  demand  for 
credentials;  gaining  a  line  of 
credit in a store or casino; getting 
the best table in a fancy restaurant.

i  Hard  difficulty:  obtaining  credit  or  a  loan  while 
implicated (or found guilty) in a criminal investiga-
tion; gaining favorable attention after being vilified 
in the media.

Pushing examples: you offer your house and/or other valu-
ables  to  secure  money  from  a  loan  shark;  you  attempt  to 
pressure the bank manager into giving you a loan. 

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  the  loan 
shark turns nasty and directs his boys to teach you a lesson; 
the bank manager calls the police; you are loaned the money, 
but it is a ploy to put you in deeper debt with a mobster who 
plans to buy out your debt and later call on you for a favor.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
loses all faith in capitalism and begins freely handing out his 
or her money to passersby. 
(See General Living Standards, page 95 for more details.)

Cthulhu Mythos (0%)
This skill reflects understanding of the inhuman (Lovecraf-
tian) Cthulhu Mythos. It is not founded on the accumulation 
of  knowledge  as  academic  skills  are.  Rather,  it  represents 
the opening and tuning of the human mind to the Cthulhu 
Mythos.  Thus,  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  derived  from  encoun-
tering Deep Ones (for example) is transferable to other situa-
tions and entities. Also referred to as "that which man should 
not  know,"  the  Cthulhu  Mythos  is  antithetical  to  human 
understanding, and exposure to it undermines human sanity. 
No investigator may take points in Cthulhu Mythos as 
a  starting  skill  (unless  agreed  with  the  Keeper).  There  is 
no tick-box for Cthulhu Mythos on the investigator sheet, 
as  successful  use  of  the  skill  does  not  offer  an  increase  in 
the investigator’s percentiles in the skill. Instead, points in 
Cthulhu Mythos are gained by encounters with the Mythos 
that result in insanity, by insane insights into the 
true nature of the universe, and by reading 
forbidden  books  and  other  Mythos 
writings. A  character’s  Sanity  may 
never  be  higher  than  99  minus 
his  or  her  Cthulhu  Mythos 
skill.  As  Cthulhu  Mythos 
points  proliferate, 
they 
crowd  out  Sanity  points, 
and  leave  the  investigator 
vulnerable. 

Whenever 

spoor  or 
other  evidence  of  Mythos 
monsters  is  found,  a  suc-
cessful roll against this skill 
allows  the  investigator  to 
identify  the  entity,  deduce 
something about its behavior 
or  guess  at  some  property  it 
may possess. A successful Cthul-
hu Mythos roll might also allow an 
investigator  to  remember  some  fact 
concerning the Mythos, identify a spell by 
seeing it cast, remember that a particular spell or 
piece of information may be found in a particular Mythos 
tome, or achieve some other task. The Cthulhu Mythos skill 
may also be used to manifest magical ‘spell-like’ effects.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
This skill begins at zero and often remains relatively low. The 
vast majority of skill rolls will be made at regular difficulty. 
i  Regular difficulty: to correctly identify a mythos en-
tity based upon secondary evidence (spoor, wounds, 
firsthand accounts).

i  Hard  difficulty:  to  identify  a  mythos  entity  based 
upon  rumors,  legends  or  minimal  evidence;  to 
identify  a  possible  vulnerability  or  knowledge  that 
grants some minor advantage over a mythos entity 
after thorough research and firsthand experience.

Pushing examples: getting closer to the creature for a better 
view; consulting dread tomes, or lore of humans (or other-

61 

chapter 4: skillswise) possessing specialist knowledge; conducting an autopsy 
to learn more; reading aloud as you retrace the strange cryp-
tograms.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  get  too 
close,  exposing  oneself  to  harm  or  suspicion;  unwittingly 
read aloud a passage from a tome that activates a summon-
ing spell; accidentally corrupt or destroy the evidence being 
studied.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
experiences  a  vision  or  revelation  that  reveals  new  truths 
about the Cthulhu Mythos, akin to an insane insight (with 
possible Cthulhu Mythos skill gain and/or associated Sanity 
loss)—see Insane Insight, page 169.

Demolitions (01%) [Uncommon]
With  this  skill  the  user  is  familiar  in  the  safe  use  of  dem-
olitions,  including  setting  and  defusing  explosive  charges. 
Mines and similar devices are designed to be easy to set (no 
roll required) and more difficult to remove or defuse. 

This skill also encompasses military-grade demolitions 

(anti-personnel mines, plastique, etc.)

Given enough time and resources, those proficient may 
rig charges to demolish a building, clear a blocked tunnel, 
and repurpose explosive devises (such as constructing low-
yield charges, booby-traps, and so on).

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: to defuse an explosive device. To 
know where to place charges for greatest effect when 
destroying a bridge or building.

i  Hard  difficulty:  to  defuse  an  explosive  device  in 

limited time.

Pushing examples: taking until the very last second to de-
fuse the bomb; double-checking all the circuits/connections 
by hand.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: if defusing 
or removing an explosive device, the consequence of failing 
a pushed roll is clear—it explodes! If using the Demolitions 
skill  to  place  charges,  the  consequence  of  failing  a  pushed 
roll may be a failure to detonate at the right time (or at all), 
or that the detonation fails to have the desired effect (either 
too great or too little). 

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
devises the most bizarre method of delivering the explosive, 
such as strapping it to a cat or to themselves.

Disguise (05%) 
To be used whenever you wish to appear to be someone oth-
er than whom you are. The user changes posture, costume, 
and/or voice to enact a disguise, posing as another person 
or another sort of person. Theatrical makeup may help, as 
will fake ID.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
There  are  two  distinct  aspects  to  this  skill:  either  you  are 

trying to conceal your true identity (such as when the police 
are looking for you) or you are impersonating someone else. 
i  Regular difficulty: to convince strangers that you are 
who you say you are. For example, to return to the 
scene of a crime that you perpetrated yesterday and 
escape notice. 

i  Hard difficulty: to convince professionals in a face-
to-face meeting that you are who you say you are. 
For  example,  to  pass  as  a  bank  employee  to  gain 
access to a bank vault.

Note  that  to  pass  as  a  specific  person  in  a  face-to-face 
meeting  with  someone  who  knows  the  person  being  imi-
tated is beyond the scope of this skill, and may well indicate 
the need for a combined skill roll at a higher difficulty (with 
Persuade, Charm, or Fast Talk).

Pushing  examples:  undergoing  a  fully  immersive  and 
intensive  preparation  (losing  oneself  in  the  role);  stealing 
personal items and utilizing them in the disguise; overt ex-
aggeration to confound the target; feigning a sudden attack 
of illness to disorient the observer.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  Being 
arrested;  causing  offence,  leading  to  violence  or  criminal 
charges; finding that the person being imitated is wanted by 
a criminal gang who come looking for vengeance.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, the investi-
gator no longer recognizes his or her own face in the mirror, 
even when the disguise is removed.

Diving (01%) [Uncommon]
The  user  is  trained  in  the  use  and  maintenance  of  diving 
equipment for swimming underwater, including underwater 
navigation, proper weighting, and emergency procedures. 

Prior to the invention of the Aqua-Lung in 1942, rigid 
diving  suits  were  worn  with  air  pumped  from  the  surface 
through a connecting tube. 

In  the  modern  age,  a  scuba  diver  will  be  familiar  with 
the  physics  of  diving,  air  pressure,  and  the  physiological 
processes that occur when breathing with pressurized air.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular  difficulty:  routine  dives  using  correct  and 

well-maintained equipment.

i  Hard  difficulty:  diving  in  dangerous  conditions  or 

with poorly maintained equipment.

Pushing  examples:  pushing  the  limits  of  the  equipment; 
methodically  double-checking  equipment;  gaining  profes-
sional assistance.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  become 
trapped  underwater;  attacked  by  sea  creatures;  suffer  the 
bends.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she be-
gins to understand whale-song; all you have to do is follow 
their instructions.

62 

Call of CthulhuDodge (half DEX%)
Allows an investigator to instinctively evade blows, thrown 
missiles and so forth. A character may attempt to use dodge 
any  number  of  times  in  a  combat  round  (but  only  once 
against a specific attack; see Chapter 6: Combat). Dodge can 
increase  through  experience,  like  other  skills.  If  an  attack 
can be seen, a character can try to dodge it. It is impossible 
to dodge bullets because they cannot be seen when in mo-
tion; the best a character can do is to take evasive action that 
results in being harder to hit (“diving for cover”).

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
The Dodge skill is mostly used in combat as part of an op-
posed roll and so no difficulty level is set. 

Note: as a combat skill, this cannot be pushed.

Drive Auto (20%)
Anyone with this skill can drive a car or light truck, make 
ordinary  maneuvers,  and  cope  with  ordinary  vehicle 
problems. If the investigator wants to lose a pursuer or tail 
someone, a Drive roll would be appropriate.

Some  other  cultures  might  replace  this  skill  with  a 
comparative  one;  the  Inuit  might  use  Drive  Dogsled,  or  a 
Victorian might use Drive Carriage.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular  difficulty:  to  successfully  weave  through 

light traffic at speed to avoid pursuit.

i  Hard difficulty: to successfully weave through heavy 

traffic at speed to avoid pursuit.

Pushing examples: driving the vehicle to its limit; not slow-
ing down, regardless of the risk.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  crashing; 
skidding to a halt, unable to proceed; being pursued by the 
police.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she will 
be found behind the wheel of a stationary vehicle making 
"brum-brum" noises.

Electrical Repair (10%)
Enables  the  investigator  to  repair  or  reconfigure  electrical 
equipment,  such  as  auto  ignitions,  electric  motors,  fuse 
boxes, and burglar alarms. In the present day, this skill has 
little to do with Electronics. To fix an electrical device may 
require special parts or tools. Jobs in the 1920s may call for 
this skill and for Mechanical Repair in combination.

Electrical  Repair  may  also  be  used  in  conjunction  with 
modern explosives, such as blasting caps, C-4 plastic explo-
sives, and mines. These weapons are designed to be easy to de-
ploy; only a fumble result will lead to misfire (remember the 
roll can be Pushed). Defusing explosives is far trickier, as they 
may be fitted with anti-tamper mechanisms; raise the level of 
difficulty when disarming explosives—see Demolitions skill.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: repairing or creating a standard 

electrical device.

i  Hard  difficulty:  repairing  something  that  is  badly 
damaged; working without the proper tools. 

Pushing  examples:  taking  longer  to  repair  or  reconfigure 
the equipment; taking a risky short cut.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: take dam-
age  from  an  electric  shock;  blow  the  fuses  and  plunge  the 
building into darkness; wreck the thing you are working on 
beyond repair.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
attempts to harness the electrical power of living organisms 
into the device.

Electronics (01%) [Modern]
For  troubleshooting  and  repairing  electronic  equipment. 
Allows simple electronic devices to be made. This is a skill 
for  the  present  day—use  Physics  and  Electrical  Repair  for 
electronic developments of the 1920s. 

Unlike the Electrical Repair skill, parts needed for elec-
tronics work often cannot be jury-rigged: they are designed 
for precise jobs. Often without the right microchip or circuit 
board, the skill-user is out of luck unless they can contrive 
some form of workaround.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Time is a factor in fabrication or repair, and the difficulty 
level should be lowered if time is unlimited, especially if the 
character has access to manuals and parts.

If an investigator has the correct parts and instructions, 
putting together a standard computer should not even re-
quire a skill roll. 

i  Regular  difficulty:  repairing  minor  damage  to  a 
computer or electronic device — the kind of service 
one might expect under warranty.

i  Hard  difficulty:  use  scavenged  parts  to  jury-rig  a 

tracking device to plant in someone’s car.

Pushing  examples:  taking  longer  to  construct  or  repair  a 
device; researching new or other methodologies.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: fry circuitry 
or  other  delicate  parts;  take  damage  from  electric  shock; 
create  a  device  that  does  something  other  than  what  was 
intended.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
becomes  paranoid,  convinced  that  every  item  they  come 
across  contains  electronic  bugging  devices:  the  telephone, 
the television, the refrigerator. 

63 

chapter 4: skillsFast Talk (05%)
Fast Talk is specifically limited to verbal trickery, deception, 
and misdirection, such as bamboozling a bouncer to let you 
inside a club, getting someone to sign a form they haven’t 
read,  making  a  policeman  look  the  other  way,  and  so  on. 
The skill is opposed by Psychology or Fast Talk. After a brief 
period  (usually  after  the  fast  talker  has  left  the  scene)  the 
target will realize that they have been conned. The effect of 
Fast Talk is always temporary, though it will last longer if a 
higher level of success is achieved.

Fast Talk may be used to haggle the price of an item or 
service down. If successful, the seller momentarily thinks that 
they  have  struck  a  good  deal;  however,  if  the  buyer  returns 
and attempts to purchase another item, the seller may refuse 
further haggling and even increase the price in order to re-
coup what they lost on the previous sale!

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
See  Charm,  Fast  Talk,  Intimidate,  and  Persuade  Skills: 
Difficulty Levels, page 93. 

Pushing  examples:  getting  up  close  and  personal  to  the 
target;  talking  outlandishly,  aiming  to  confuse  the  target. 
Remember  this  is  Fast  Talk,  so  if  the  investigator  begins 
to  take  an  alternative  approach,  the  Keeper  may  ask  for  a 
different skill to be used; if threats are used, it may become 
Intimidate, or if a protracted discussion ensues, it may be-
come Persuade. Switching from one to the other to gain a 
second roll still constitutes a Pushed roll.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: cause great 
offence leading to violence, outrage, or criminal proceedings. 
If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 

begins hurling random abusive phrases at people. 

Fighting (Specializations) (varies %)
Fighting skill denotes a character’s skill in melee combat. You 
may spend skill points to purchase any skill specialization. 
The  generic  "Fighting"  skill  cannot  be  purchased.  Choose 
fighting  specializations  appropriate  to  your  investigator’s 
occupation and history.

Those  starting  with  a  Fighting  (Brawl)  skill  of  50%  or 
higher may wish to choose a type of formal training as part 
of their background to account for his or her skill level. A 
myriad of fighting styles exist. Martial arts are simply a way 
of developing a person’s Fighting skill. Decide how the char-
acter learned to fight, whether it be formal military training, 
martial  arts  classes,  or  learned  the  hard  way  as  a  result  of 
street-fighting.  The  term  brawl  might  feel  too  crude  for  a 
skilled  martial  artist  and  could  be  replaced  (with  "Karate" 
for example) if a player so wished.

Note: as a combat skill, this cannot be pushed.

Fighting specializations:

Brawl  (25%):  includes  all  unarmed  fighting  and  basic 
weapons that anyone could pick up and make use of, such as 
clubs (up to cricket bats or baseball bats), knives, and many 
improvised weapons, such as bottles and chair legs. To de-
termine the damage done with an improvised weapon, the 
Keeper should refer to the weapon chart and pick something 
comparable.

Chainsaw  (10%):  the  first  gasoline-powered,  mass-pro-
duced chainsaw appeared in 1927; however, earlier versions 
existed. 

Flail (10%): nunchaku, morning stars, and similar medieval 
weapons.

Garrote  (15%):  any  length  of  material  used  to  strangle. 
Requires the victim to make a Fighting Maneuver to escape, 
or suffer 1D6 damage per round.

Spear (20%): lances and spears. If thrown, use Throw skill.

Sword (20%): all blades over two feet in length.

Whip (05%): bolas and whips.

Note: Thrown knives use the Throw skill.

Weapons  and  their  skill  categories  are  listed  in  Table 
XVII: Weapons (pages 401-405). The above specializations 
may  not  cover  all  weapons,  but  where  possible  try  to  fit 
other weapons into one of the above categories. Chainsaw is 
included as a weapon because of its use in numerous films, 
but players should note that the chance of a fumble is dou-
bled and that they risk killing their investigator (or losing a 
limb) should this happen.

Firearms (Specializations) (varies %)
Covers all manner of firearms, as well as bows and crossbows. 
You  may  spend  skill  points  to  purchase  any  skill  special-
ization.  The  generic  "Firearms"  skill  cannot  be  purchased. 
Choose  specializations  appropriate  to  your  investigator’s 
occupation and history.

Note: as a combat skill, this cannot be pushed.

Firearms specializations:

Bow (15%): use of bows and crossbows, ranging from medi-
eval longbows to modern, high-powered compound bows. 

Handgun (20%): use for all pistol-like firearms when firing 
discrete  shots.  For  machine  pistols  (MAC-11,  Uzi  pistol, 
etc.)  in  Modern  era  games,  use  the  Submachine  Gun  skill 
when firing bursts. 

Heavy Weapons (10%): use for grenade launchers, anti-tank 
rockets, etc.

Axe (15%): use this skill for larger wood axes. A small hatch-
et can be used with the basic brawling skill. If thrown, use 
Throw skill.

Flamethrower  (10%):  weapons  projecting  a  stream  of  ig-
nited flammable liquid or gas. May either be carried by the 
operator or mounted on a vehicle.

64 

Call of CthulhuMachine  Gun  (10%):  weapons  firing  bursts  from  a  bipod 
or tripod mounted weapon. If single shots are fired from a 
bipod, use Rifle skill. The differences between assault rifle, 
submachine gun and light machine gun are tenuous today. 

Rifle/Shotgun  (25%):  with  this  skill  any  type  of  rifle 
(whether  lever-action,  bolt-action  or  semi-automatic)  or 
scatter-gun  can  be  fired.  Since  the  load  from  a  shotgun 
expands in a spreading pattern, the user’s chance to hit does 
not decrease with range, but the damage dealt does. When 
an  assault  rifle  fires  a  single  shot  (or  multiple  singles)  use 
this skill. 

Submachine  Gun  (15%):  use  this  skill  when  firing  any 
machine pistol or submachine gun; also for assault rifles set 
on burst.

Note: Thrown knives use the Throw skill.

Firearms are listed in the Table XVII: Weapons (pages 

401-405).

First Aid (30%) 
The  user  is  able  to  provide  emergency  medical  care.  This 
might encompass: applying a splint to a broken leg, stemming 
bleeding,  treating  a  burn,  resuscitating  a  drowning  victim, 
dressing and cleaning a wound, etc. First Aid cannot be used 
to treat diseases (where the Medicine skill is required).

To be effective, First Aid must be delivered within one 
hour, in which case it grants 1 hit point. It may be attempted 
once, with subsequent attempts constituting a Pushed roll. 
Two people can work together to administer First Aid, with 
a success granted if either one of them rolls a success. Suc-
cessful use of First Aid can rouse an unconscious person to 
consciousness. A character is limited to one successful treat-
ment of both First Aid and Medicine until further damage 
is taken.

When  treating  a  dying  character,  successful  First  Aid 
stabilizes him or her for one hour and grants 1 temporary 
hit point. At the end of the hour, and each hour thereafter, 
the  character  must  make  a  successful  CON  roll  to  remain 
stabilized, otherwise (with a failed CON roll) the character 
is  dying  and  loses  the  temporary  hit  point  and  must  now 
make a CON roll per round thereafter to stave-off death. If 
the  character  survives  until  the  following  round,  First Aid 
can  be  attempted  again  (by  up  to  two  individuals).  This 
can be continued (without constituting a Pushed roll) until 
stabilization or death.

First Aid (and only First Aid) can save the life of a dying 
character, after which they must receive a successful Medi-
cine roll or be hospitalized. Thus, First Aid is an important 
skill to have, alongside Medicine, if you wish to be an effec-
tive medic. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Administering First Aid to a fellow human is always 
of  Regular  difficulty  level.  If  one  were  treating  an 
alien  being  whose  physiology  was  unfamiliar,  the 
difficulty level would be higher.

Pushing examples: taking longer to treat the patient; em-
ploying high-risk methods to stabilize the wound.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: make things 
worse, causing an additional point of damage.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
feels compelled to "heal" the person, even if it means ampu-
tation or worse. In effect their endeavors constitute physical 
attacks which may lead to murder if they are not stopped.

History (05%)
Enables  an  investigator  to  remember  the  significance  of  a 
country,  city,  region,  or  person,  as  pertinent.  A  successful 
roll might be used to help identify tools, techniques, or ideas 
familiar to ancestors, but little known today. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular  difficulty:  to  recall  some  pertinent  and 

useful information.

i  Hard difficulty: to know some obscure, detailed and 

useful information.

Pushing  examples:  taking  more  time  to  examine;  con-
ducting further research; consulting another expert; hiring 
assistants to conduct detailed research, taking months, and 
at a huge cost.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  consul-
tations  alert  your  adversaries,  who  become  aware  of  your 
intent; your facts are erroneous and lead you into danger; 
much time and money is wasted on fruitless research.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she is 
convinced that they are somehow displaced in time, or per-
haps they start believing they are living in a historic period, 
dressing and speaking in an archaic manner.

Hypnosis (01%) [Uncommon]
The user is able to induce a trancelike state in a willing target 
who  experiences  heightened  suggestibility,  relaxation,  and 
possible  recall  of  forgotten  memories.  The  limits  of  hyp-
notism should be decided by the Keeper to fit their game; 
it  may  be  that  only  willing  subjects  can  be  hypnotized,  or 
the Keeper may allow it to be used on unwilling targets in a 
more aggressive manner.

This  skill  may  be  utilized  as  hypnotherapy  on  those 
suffering  mental  trauma,  reducing  the  effects  of  a  phobia 
or mania in a patient (successful use means that the patient 
overcomes the phobia or mania on one occasion). Note that 
a series of successful hypnotherapy sessions may be needed 
to fully cure someone of a phobia (minimum of 1D6 ses-
sions, at the Keeper’s discretion).

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Hypnosis is opposed with Psychology or POW for 

an unwilling subject. 

Pushing examples: increasing your influence on the target 
by  ensuring  their  full  and  undivided  attention;  assaulting 

65 

chapter 4: skillsthe  target’s  senses  with  confusing  lights  or  props;  the  use 
of drugs to make the target more susceptible to suggestion.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: some past 
memory  or  trauma  is  bought  to  the  surface,  causing  the 
target 1D6 Sanity loss; the target falls into a trance, causing 
them  to  walk  in  front  of  a  bus  at  a  later  time;  the  target’s 
mind  (or  the  investigator’s  mind)  is  temporarily  emptied, 
allowing possession by a malevolent entity.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, his or her mind 

regresses to a childlike state until treatment is administered.

Intimidate (15%)
Intimidation can take many forms, including physical force, 
psychological manipulation, and threats. It is used to fright-
en or compel a person to act in a certain way. Intimidate is 
opposed by Intimidate or Psychology.

Backing  up  intimidation  with  a  weapon  or  some  oth-
er  powerful  threat  or  incentive  may  reduce  the  difficulty 
level.  When  Pushing  an  Intimidation  roll,  one  possible 
consequence of failure is carrying out one’s threat, perhaps 
beyond the level of that which was intended.

Intimidate  may  be  used  to  force  down  the  price  of  an 
item or service. If successful, the seller may reduce the price, 
or hand the item over free of charge, but depending on the 
situation they may later report the incident to the police or 
to members of the local organized crime gang.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
See  Charm,  Fast  Talk,  Intimidate  and  Persuade  Skills: 
Difficulty Levels, page 93. 

Pushing examples: Causing actual physical harm to the tar-
get or to something or someone that the target cares about. 
Remember that this is Intimidation; if the investigator be-
gins to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may ask for 
a different skill to be used. If the threats are retracted and the 
investigator then tries to befriend the target, it may become 
Charm;  or  if  a  protracted  and  unthreatening  discussion 
ensues, it may become Persuade. Switching from one to the 
other to gain a second roll still constitutes a Pushed roll.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  accidentally 
pulling the trigger of the gun you’re waving in the target’s face; 
the target’s mind snaps, resulting in violence or inane babbling, 
after which no more can be gained; the target simply laughs in 
your face and won’t break no matter what you do; the target 
somehow turns the tables and intimidates the intimidator.

It is important to note that Pushing an Intimidate roll 
means taking things to the limit. This could involve days of 
interrogation, or an ultimatum with a gun to the head. Ei-
ther way, a Pushed roll either gains the required information 
or renders some kind of end to the situation.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she be-
comes intensely fearful of the target and does their bidding.

Jump (20%)
With success, the investigator may leap up or down vertically, 
or jump horizontally from a standing or running start. When 
falling, Jump may be used to lessen the potential fall damage.
Judgment  must  be  exercised  as  to  what  constitutes  a 
regular jump, a hard jump or an extreme jump (respectively 
requiring Regular success, Hard success, and Extreme suc-
cess). As a guide, a regular success would be required for an 
investigator to safely leap down vertically to his or her own 
height, jump horizontally from a standing start across a gap 
for a distance equal to the jumper’s own height, or run and 
then jump horizontally to a distance of twice the jumper’s 
own height. One might achieve double this distance with an 
Extreme success, although bear in mind the world record for 
the long jump is around 29 feet.

 If falling from a height, a successful Jump prepares for 

the fall, reducing resultant damage by half.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular  difficulty:  safely  leap  down  vertically  a 
distance  equal  to  the  jumper’s  own  height;  jump 
horizontally from a standing start, across a gap for a 
distance equal to the jumper’s own height; run and 
then  jump  horizontally  to  a  distance  of  twice  the 
jumper’s own height.

i  Hard  difficulty:  as  for  a  regular  difficulty  but 
increase  distances  by  50%;  perhaps  attempting  to 
jump from a rooftop and through the window of a 
neighboring building across the alley.

Pushing  examples:  Delaying  and  taking  time  to  assess 
the  jump;  throwing  all  your  weight  and  force  behind  the 
jump—really stretching for it. In some instances a Pushed 
roll is not possible; if one leaps across an abyss one cannot 
have a second attempt. However, if one is trapped in a pit 
and jumping to escape, one could have any number of at-
tempts,  which  would  then  be  summarized  by  one  Pushed 
skill roll.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  fall  and 
suffer physical harm; achieve the jump but a valuable pos-
session (of the Keeper’s choice) is dropped in the process.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she will 

become convinced that they can fly.

Language, Other (Specializations) (01%)
When choosing this skill, the exact language must be spec-
ified and written next to the skill. An individual can know 
any  number  of  languages.  The  skill  represents  the  user’s 
chance to understand, speak, read and write in a language 
other than his or her own. 

Ancient  or  unknown  languages  (such  as  Aklo,  Hyper-
borean,  etc.)  should  not  be  chosen  (unless  agreed  with  the 
Keeper), but ordinary earthly languages may be. The Keeper 
may raise the difficulty level if archaic speech or writing in 
that language is encountered. A single successful Other Lan-
guage roll normally allows comprehension of an entire book. 

66 

Call of CthulhuSuggestions regarding the Other Languages skill:
i  At  5%  skill  a  language  can  be  correctly  identified 

without need for a roll.

i  At 10% skill simple ideas can be communicated.
i  At 30% transactional requests can be understood.
i  At 50% skill a person is fluent.
i  At  75%  skill  in  a  character  can  pass  for  a  native 

speaker of a foreign language. 

i  To  identify  a  present-day  human  language  (un-
known to the investigator), use a Know roll.
i  To identify an extinct human language, use an Ar-

chaeology or History roll.

i  To identify an alien language, use a Cthulhu Mythos 

or possibly an Occult roll. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Regular conversation, perhaps with pauses for clarification 
(when speaking to a less than fluent foreign speaker) does 
not require a roll for those who are fluent.

i  Regular difficulty: conversation (perhaps at speed); 
written  material  containing  a  few  technical  or  un-
common terms.

i  Hard difficulty: high content of unusual technical terms; 
historically archaic phrases; speaker has unusual dialect.

Pushing examples: taking longer to think through the words 
you want to say; taking long pauses to answer what you have 
been told; referencing other books to make a translation.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: exaggerated 
or loud discussions between investigators and third parties 
alert some enemy faction to the investigators’ intentions; a 
word or phrase is misunderstood (perhaps the meaning is 
reversed); the listener takes offense to an unintentional slur, 
and  they  respond  with  their  fists,  or  turn  everyone  in  the 
neighborhood against you.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
begins to speak in tongues, or imagines that they are using 
the Enochian language.

Language (Own) (EDU%)
When  choosing  this  skill,  the  exact  language  must  be 
specified and written next to the skill. In infancy and early 
childhood, most humans use a single language. The tongue 
chosen by the player for the Own Language automatically 
starts  as  equal  to  the  investigator’s  EDU  characteristic; 
thereafter  the  investigator  understands,  speaks,  reads,  and 
writes at that percentage or higher (if further skill points are 
added during investigator creation).

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Normally  no  skill  roll  is  necessary  to  use  Own  Language. 
Even when technical, archaic, or esoteric terms are used, if 

both parties are sympathetic to each other and there is suf-
ficient time for conversation, most things should be covered 
without a die roll.

If  a  document  is  extremely  difficult  to  read  or  in  an 

archaic dialect, the Keeper may require a roll.

Pushing examples: see Language (Other) skill, above.

Law (05%)
Represents the chance of knowing pertinent law, precedent, 
legal maneuvers or court procedure. The practice of law as 
a  profession  can  lead  to  great  rewards  and  political  office, 
but it requires intense application over many years—a high 
Credit  Rating  is  also  usually  crucial  in  this  regard.  In  the 
United States, the State Bar of a particular state must sanc-
tion one’s practice of law. 

When  in  a  foreign  country  the  level  of  difficulty  may 
be increased when using this skill, unless the character has 
spent many months studying that nation’s legal system. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty level: understanding and utilizing 
the details of a relevant law or legal procedure.
i  Hard difficulty: remembering or understanding an 
obscure legal precedent, or cross-examining a highly 
competent hostile witness.

Pushing  examples:  delaying  to  consider  your  argument; 
explaining in high detail the nuances of the case/situation; 
taking  significant  time  to  conduct  research;  bending  the 
letter of the law to drive your argument.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  misinter-
preting a law or stepping outside of the accepted legal proce-
dure leads you to break the law and draws police attention; 
wasting valuable time and money on research and legal fees; 
you are held in contempt of court and thrown in the cells for 
at least 24 hours.

If a Pushed roll is failed, an insane investigator will now 

believe that he or she is above the law.

Library Use (20%)
Library Use enables an investigator to find a piece of infor-
mation, such as a certain book, newspaper, or reference in 
a  library,  collection  of  documents  or  database,  assuming 
the  item  is  there.  Use  of  this  skill  marks  several  hours  of 
continuous search.  

This skill can locate a locked case or rare-book special 
collection,  but  Persuade,  Fast  Talk,  Charm,  Intimidate, 
Credit Rating, or special credentials may have to be used to 
get access to the books or information in question.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: locating a book or piece of infor-

mation in a library.

i  Hard  difficulty:  identifying  a  piece  of  information 
in  a  disorganized  library,  or  if  you  are  extremely 
pressed for time.

67 

chapter 4: skillsPushing examples: pressing the librarian for extensive as-
sistance;  taking  longer  to  systematically  work  through  the 
stacks.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  finding  a 
similar  book,  containing  misleading  information,  which 
will  lead  the  investigators  into  danger;  entanglement  with 
an adversary—perhaps they are alerted to your research and 
act against you, or they check out the book you are searching 
for (or simply tear out the pages in question); getting into 
an  argument  with  the  librarian,  resulting  in  your  library 
membership being revoked.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she hoards 
books, cutting out pages to stick to their bedroom wall, making 
copious bizarre notes, linking the pages with threads of cotton 
and pins. Alternatively, the investigator is obsessed with finding 
the correct book or piece of information, spending all of their 
time pilfering and poring over books. 

Listen (20%)
Measures the ability of an investigator to interpret and un-
derstand sound, including overheard conversations, mutters 
behind a  closed door, and whispered words in a cafe. The 
Keeper may use it to determine the course of an impending 
encounter: was your investigator awakened by that cracking 
twig? By extension, a high Listen skill can indicate a good 
level of general awareness in a character.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Listen can be opposed by Stealth when someone is creeping 
up on you.

i  Regular  difficulty:  hearing  something  approaching 
you (with a Stealth skill of below 50); eavesdropping 
on a nearby conversation.

i  Hard difficulty: hearing something creep up on you 
(with a Stealth skill of 50 to 89); eavesdropping on 
whispered conversation.

Pushing examples: stopping dead still and listening; getting 
closer to the presumed source (e.g. putting your ear to the 
train track or the door); telling everyone to be quiet (mak-
ing a noise yourself) and then listening.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the "thing" 
has caught you unawares (you are surprised); you misheard 
the conversation and get the facts mixed up; you are caught 
trying to eavesdrop, and find yourself in a very embarrassing 
predicament.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she be-
comes overly sensitive to all sounds and is unable to operate 
without earplugs or similar.

Locksmith (01%) 
A  locksmith  can  open  car  doors,  hot-wire  autos,  jimmy 
library  windows,  figure  out  Chinese  puzzle  boxes,  and 
penetrate  ordinary  commercial  alarm  systems.  The  user 
may repair locks, make keys, or open locks with the aid of 

Library Use will turn up shocking clues.

skeleton keys, picks and other tools. Especially difficult locks 
may be of a higher difficulty level. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: opening or repairing a standard 

lock.

i  Hard difficulty: opening a high-security lock.

Pushing examples: completely dismantling the lock; taking 
longer; using force to pry the mechanism.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the lock is 
damaged beyond repair (perhaps your lock pick has snapped 
off inside the lock); you break the puzzle box (perhaps only 
smashing it will open it now); you trip an alarm, or make 
enough noise for someone or something to come looking…
If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
gives  up  on  the  lock  in  question  and  realizes  the  higher 
purpose of unlocking their own mind; a veil has been lifted 
from their eyes, and they see the world in a new way that 
makes complete sense to them, but no sense  to anyone  of 
sound mind.

Lore (01%) (Specializations)  
[Uncommon]
This  skill  represents  a  character’s  expert  understanding  of 
a  subject  that  falls  outside  the  normal  bounds  of  human 
knowledge.  Specializations  of  Lore  should  be  specific  and 
unusual, such as:

i  Dream Lore
i  Necronomicon Lore (e.g. history of)

68 

Call of Cthulhui  UFO Lore
i  Vampire Lore
i  Werewolf Lore
i  Yaddithian Lore
Where the Keeper wishes to test an investigator’s knowl-
edge  of  something  that  falls  within  the  bounds  of  one  of 
these  fields  of  Lore,  but  the  investigator  lacks  the  relevant 
Lore  specialization,  the  Keeper  may  for  allow  for  another 
(more  general)  skill  to  be  used  but  require  a  higher  level 
of success. For example, if the Keeper were testing a mod-
ern-day investigator’s knowledge of alien abductions in the 
1980s, he or she could ask for either a Regular success using 
UFO Lore or a Hard success using History.

Lore skills are also used as a shorthand method of com-
municating the knowledge of a non-player character to the 
Keeper. In the main, knowledge is represented by the EDU 
characteristic and specific skills, such as History or Cthul-
hu Mythos. The Keeper should decide when the Lore skill 
should be incorporated into the game—usually only when 
a  particular  area  of  specialist  knowledge  is  central  to  the 
campaign being played. 

Mechanical Repair (10%)
This allows the investigator to repair a broken machine or 
to create a new one. Basic carpentry and plumbing projects 
can be performed, as well as constructing items (such as a 
pulley system) and repairing items (such as a steam pump). 
Special  tools  or  parts  may  be  required.  This  skill  can  be 
used to open common household locks, but nothing more 
advanced—see the Locksmith skill for more complex locks. 
Mechanical Repair is a companion skill to Electrical Repair, 
and both may be necessary to fix complex devices, such as a 
car or an aircraft.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: repair or create a simple device; 

open a basic lock.

i  Hard difficulty: repair a very badly damaged device; 
create a complex device with limited resources.

Pushing examples: completely dismantling the device; tak-
ing longer; risk using excessive force to "knock" the device 
into action (e.g. hitting the thing until it works).

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  you  have 
broken  the  device  beyond  repair;  you  hurt  yourself  while 
working  on  the  device  (perhaps  cutting  your  hand,  etc.); 
you  become  obsessed  with  the  device  and  find  you  have 
spent the whole day and night working on it.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she fills 
a telephone directory-sized notepad with scribbled designs, 
culminating in the creation of a bizarre device using organic 
matter and household appliances.

Medicine (01%)
The  user  diagnoses  and  treats  accidents,  injuries,  diseases, 
poisonings,  etc.,  and  makes  public  health  recommenda-
tions.  If  an  era  has  no  good  treatment  for  a  malady,  the 
effort  is  limited,  uncertain,  or  inconclusive.  The  Medicine 
skill  grants  knowledge  of  a  wide  variety  of  drugs  and  po-
tions, natural and man-made, and understanding of the side 
effects and contraindications.

Treatment  using  the  Medicine  skill  takes  a  minimum 
of one hour and can be delivered any time after damage is 
taken, but if this is not performed on the same day, the diffi-
culty level is increased (requiring a Hard success). A person 
treated successfully with Medicine recovers 1D3 hit points 
(in  addition  to  any  First  Aid  they  have  received),  except 
in the case of a dying character, who must initially receive 
successful First Aid to stabilized them before a Medicine roll 
is made.

A character is limited to one treatment of First Aid and 
Medicine until further damage is taken (except in the case 
of a dying character who may require stabilizing with First 
Aid multiple times). Successful use of Medicine can rouse 
an unconscious person to consciousness.

In treating Major Wounds, successful use of the Medi-
cine skill provides the patient a Bonus die on their weekly 
recovery roll.

The  Keeper  may  grant  automatic  success  for  medical 

treatment in a contemporary, well-equipped hospital.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular  difficulty:  diagnosis  and  treatment  of 
standard  medical  ailments,  with  access  to  equipment  (at 
least a doctor’s bag containing drugs and instruments) and 
a suitable environment.

i  Hard difficulty: diagnosis and treatment in a dirty 
and unsafe environment, with the minimum of equipment.

Pushing examples: consulting with colleagues; conducting 
further  research;  trying  something  experimental  or  more 
risky; performing some form of clinical experiment.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: you misdi-
agnose the ailment and you worsen the patient’s condition 
(perhaps even killing them); your good standing comes into 
question  and  you  are  investigated  for  malpractice.  In  the 
case of a dying character, if a Pushed Medicine roll is failed, 
the patient dies.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  Pushed  roll,  the  results 
will be disturbing in the extreme, perhaps involving ampu-
tation  or  blood  poisoning  as  a  result  of  failed  attempts  to 
graft animal parts to the person.

Natural World (10%)
Originally  the  study  of  plant  and  animal  life  in  its  envi-
ronment.  By  the  nineteenth  century,  this  study  had  long 
separated  into  a  range  of  academic  disciplines  (Biology, 
Botany, etc.) As a skill, Natural World represents the tradi-
tional (unscientific) knowledge and personal observation of 
farmers, fishermen, inspired amateurs, and hobbyists. It can 

69 

chapter 4: skillsidentify  species,  habits,  and  habitats  in  a  general  way,  and 
identify tracks, spoors, and calls, as well as allowing guesses 
as to what may be important to a particular species. For a 
scientific  understanding  of  the  natural  world,  one  should 
look to the Biology, Botany and Zoology skills.

Natural World may or may not be accurate—this is the 
region of appreciation, judgment, folk tradition, and enthu-
siasm. Use Natural World to judge horseflesh at the county 
fair, or decide whether a butterfly collection is excellent or 
just excellently framed.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular  difficulty:  identifying  a  particular  species; 
remembering some common lore; knowing the best 
place to catch some fish.

i  Hard  difficulty:  identifying  an  unusual  specimen; 
locating a rare species of plant or animal; remem-
bering a very obscure fact or piece of lore.

Pushing examples: spending much longer (forgetful of the 
time)  examining  the  habitat;  tasting  the  unknown  mush-
room or plant to get a better idea what it is; consulting with 
the old woman in the village about the local wildlife.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: you spend 
long  hours  obsessively  poring  over  books  to  identify  the 
species; you get the facts wrong, and instead of the wasps be-
ing repelled by your concoction of swamp mud and herbs, 
they are drawn to you (with painful results); you picked the 
wrong  mushroom  and  find  yourself,  hours  later,  walking 
naked towards a policeman.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
goes native and will be lost in the wilderness until friends 
come to their aid.

Navigate (10%)
Allows  the  user  to  find  his  or  her  way  in  storms  or  clear 
weather, in day or at night. Those of higher skill are familiar 
with astronomical tables, charts, instruments, and satellite 
location gear, as they exist in the era of play. One could also 
use  this  skill  to  measure  and  map  an  area  (cartography), 
whether an island of many square miles or the interior of 
a  single  room—use  of  modern  technology  may  lower  or 
negate the difficulty level.

Rolls for this skill may be made as concealed rolls by the 
Keeper—a matter for the investigators to attempt, and later 
witness the results. 

If  the  character  is  familiar  with  the  area,  a  bonus  die 

should be granted to the roll.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: keep on the right route; use the 
sun and stars to identify compass positions; map a 
small area of terrain.

i  Hard  difficulty:  head  in  the  right  direction  when 
there  is  no  clear  route  or  landmarks;  map  a  large 
area of complex terrain.

Pushing examples: getting the map out and delaying while 
you attempt to work out where you are; going back to where 
you started from and trying again.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: you get lost 
and find yourself being watched or ambushed by a bear; you 
go round and round in circles, and your companions stop 
following you (you’re on your own now…); you mistake the 
stars, and rather than getting away from the cultists' search 
parties, you end up back at the cult’s hidden base.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
throws away the map (as happens in The Blair Witch Project) 
and follows their intuition. Their intuition does not work.

Occult (05%)
The  user  recognizes  occult  paraphernalia,  words  and  con-
cepts, as well as folk traditions, and can identify grimoires 
of  magic  and  occult  codes.  The  occultist  is  familiar  with 
the  families  of  secret  knowledge  passed  down  from  Egypt 
and Sumer, from the Medieval and Renaissance West, and 
perhaps from Asia and Africa as well. 

Comprehending certain books may provide percentiles 
of  Occult.  This  skill  does  not  apply  to  spells,  books,  and 
magic of the Cthulhu Mythos, although worshipers of the 
Great Old Ones often adopt occult ideas. 

Whether non-Mythos magic is real or fraudulent in your 
game is for the Keeper to determine (see Chapter 9: Magic).

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: recall information from folklore 
or occult theories; understand the meaning of tarot 
cards or other divination techniques.

i  Hard difficulty: identify rare or unique occult tomes; re-
call the finer details of secret occult practices and rituals.

Pushing  examples:  taking  more  time  to  study  the  site  or 
item;  conducting  further  research;  consulting  another 
expert; purging oneself and undertaking extreme personal 
preparation in advance of ritual performance.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: information 
is misremembered, and the ritual is performed incorrectly 
with disastrous consequences (perhaps the house is burned 
to  the  ground);  in  preparing  the  circle  of  protection,  you 
use  the  wrong  ingredients,  and  rather  than  ward  off  the 
spirits you genuinely summon something malevolent; your 
research  has  uncovered  a  hitherto  unknown  Mythos  link, 
and your realization shatters your mind (SAN loss).

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, this is likely 
to manifest in some form on obsession: perhaps the inves-
tigator tattoos occult symbols upon his or her cheeks and 
palms, or cannot act without first using a scrying crystal to 
divine their future.

70 

Call of Cthulhuinitely and insidiously; for years perhaps, until events or an-
other Persuade turn the target’s mind in another direction. 
Persuade may be used for bargaining, to haggle the price 
of an item or service down. If successful, the seller is thor-
oughly convinced that they have struck a good deal. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
See  Charm,  Fast  Talk,  Intimidate,  and  Persuade  Skills: 
Difficulty Levels, page 93. 

Pushing  examples:  getting  close  and  personal  to  advance 
your  argument  or  appeal  to  the  target’s  reason;  demon-
strating through logical reasoning and examples, in detail; 
using carefully preplanned suggestion techniques (possibly 
also subliminal messages) to make the target as receptive as 
possible; putting on a grand show (staging, fireworks, free 
gifts,  free  drinks,  bribes,  etc.)  in  order  to  really  push  your 
point of view front-and-center for a group of people.

Remember that this is Persuade; if the investigator be-
gins to take an alternative approach, the Keeper may ask for 
a different skill to be used. If threats are used, it may become 
Intimidate;  or  if  the  investigator  is  relying  on  befriending 
the target, it may become Charm. Switching from one to the 
other to gain a second roll still constitutes a Pushed roll.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll:  the  target 
takes  great  offence  and  refuses  to  have  any  more  to  do 
with  you;  your  bribe  worked  and  the  target  signed  the 
forms—however in the cold light of morning they feel they 
have  been  duped,  and  now  their  solicitor  has  employed  a 
private eye to find out what you’re up to, or is suing you for 
malpractice; the target doesn’t like your big talk and, from 
out of nowhere, they pull a knife on you; you persuaded the 
security guard to turn a blind eye to your robbery—however 
they lose their job and, wracked with guilt, they commit sui-
cide (the full implications of your actions hit you and you 
lose Sanity for causing the death of an innocent).

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, they may be 
found later on a street corner trying to convince passersby 
of their argument or bizarre point of view.

Pilot (Specializations) (01%)
The  air  or  water  equivalent  of  Drive Automobile,  this  is  the 
maneuver skill for flying or floating craft. You may spend skill 
points  to  purchase  any  skill  specialization.  The  generic  Pilot 
skill cannot be purchased. An investigator might have several 
versions of this skill in the spaces on the investigator sheet (such 
as Pilot Aircraft, Pilot Dirigible, etc.). Each starts at 01%. 

Anyone with modest skill can sail or fly on a calm day with 
good  visibility,  although  skill  rolls  are  required  for  storms, 
navigation  by  instrument,  low  visibility,  and  other  difficult 
situations. Bad weather, poor visibility, and damage may raise 
the difficulty level of skill rolls to pilot air and water craft. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: make an emergency landing with 

a light aircraft in a farmer’s field.

i  Hard difficulty: pilot the craft in very poor condi-
tions (e.g. extremely bad weather, faulty equipment).

Operate Heavy Machinery (01%)
Required  to  drive  and  operate  a  tank,  backhoe,  steam 
shovel, or other large-scale construction machine. For very 
different sorts of machines, the Keeper may decide to raise 
the difficulty level if the problems encountered are mostly 
unfamiliar ones; someone used to running a bulldozer, for 
instance, will not be quickly competent with the steam tur-
bines in a ship’s engine room. 

 Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: operate a crane or road digger.
i  Hard  difficulty:  manipulate  the  machinery  to 
achieve  some  delicate  or  specific  task,  such  as  un-
earthing  delicate  dinosaur  eggs  with  a  mechanical 
digger without breaking them.

Pushing  examples:  going  step-by-step  with  the  operating 
manual; taking time to practice; seeking a teacher.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: you’re driv-
ing the bulldozer, but get overconfident, and lose control so 
it veers into a brick wall (the wall comes down on you, or 
perhaps worse).

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she may 
believe they are tasked with unearthing or building a temple 
to the old ones. 

Persuade (10%)
Use  Persuade  to  convince  a  target  about  a  particular  idea, 
concept, or belief through reasoned argument, debate and 
discussion. Persuade may be employed without reference to 
truth. The successful application of Persuade takes time: at 
least half an hour. If you want to persuade someone quickly, 
you should use Fast Talk.

Depending  on  the  goal  expressed  by  the  player,  if  the 
investigator takes sufficient time, the effect may linger indef-

71 

chapter 4: skillsPushing  examples:  pulling  the  aircraft  up  and  making  a 
second and final attempt at landing; pushing the vehicle to 
its limit; making a risky maneuver to lose a pursuer.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the results 
of  a  failed  roll  should  fit  the  situation.  It  may  be  that  the 
craft is somehow damaged, and repairs will have to be made 
before  it  can  be  used  again  (which  may  prove  impossible 
in  remote  locations);  passengers  are  injured  during  the 
maneuver or accident; you emergency-landed the plane in 
the jungle, and awake tied to large stones that circle a huge, 
bubbling  cooking  pot.  Reserve  burning  wrecks  for  excep-
tional  circumstances,  such  as  when  the  pilot  is  insane,  or 
when taking a crazy risk at high speed.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she will be-
lieve that they are capable of death-defying stunts. They are not.

Piloting specializations:

Pilot (Aircraft): understands and is increasingly competent 
with  a  general  class  of  aircraft  named  below.  Upon  any 
landing,  even  under  the  best  conditions,  a  Pilot  roll  must 
be made. The consequence of failure is situation-dependent. 
Failing a (Pushed) skill roll to land in a flat, grassy field on 
a calm summer’s day may simply indicate a bumpy landing, 
perhaps  deterring  more  delicate  passengers  from  flying 
again. At the other extreme, failing a (Pushed) skill roll to 
land on icy tundra during a storm may well result in the de-
struction of the airplane and death or injury of all involved. 
Failure  commonly  represents  damage  to  the  craft,  which 
must be repaired before the next take-off. A result of 100 is 
a memorable disaster.

Each class of aircraft counts as a different skill and should 
be listed independently, or as the Keeper sees fit. 1920s: Pilot 
Balloon/Dirigible/Civil  Prop  only.  Present  day:  Pilot  Civil 
Prop,  Pilot  Civil  Jet,  Pilot  Airliner,  Pilot  Jet  Fighter,  Pilot 
Helicopter. Piloting skill may be transferred to an alternative 
form of aircraft, but the level of difficulty may be increased.

Pilot (Boat): understands the behavior of small motor and 
sailing craft in wind, storms, and tides, and can read wave 
and wind action to suggest hidden obstacles and approach-
ing  storms.  In  a  wind,  novice  sailors  will  find  docking  a 
rowboat difficult. 

Psychoanalysis (01%) 
The skill refers to the range of emotional therapies, not just 
to Freudian procedures. Formal psychotherapy was still in 
its infancy in the 1890s, though some procedures are as old 
as  humanity.  Sometimes  it  was  looked  on  as  a  fraudulent 
study,  even  in  the  1920s.  The  common  term  then  for  an 
analyst or scholar of emotional disorders was alienist. In the 
present day, a combination of therapies has evolved, and this 
skill now could be justly named Psychiatric Treatment.

Intensive  psychoanalysis  can  return  Sanity  points  to 
an  investigator  patient.  Once  per  game  month,  to  learn 
the progress of the therapy, make a 1D100 roll against the 
analyst or doctor’s Psychoanalysis skill. If the roll succeeds, 

the patient gains 1D3 Sanity points. If the roll fails, add no 
points.  If  the  roll  is  fumbled,  then  the  patient  loses  1D6 
Sanity points, and treatment by that analyst concludes: there 
has been some sort of serious incident or dramatic setback 
in  the  therapy,  and  the  relationship  between  patient  and 
therapist has broken down beyond saving.

In the game, psychoanalysis alone does not speed recov-
ery from indefinite insanity, which requires 1D6 months of 
institutional (or similar) care, of which psychotherapy may 
form a part.

Successful use of this skill can allow a character to cope 
with the subject of a phobia for a short time, or to see delu-
sions for what they are. In play this would allow for an insane 
investigator to ignore the effects of a phobia or mania for a 
brief  period,  allowing  a  claustrophobe  to  hide  in  a  broom 
cupboard  for  ten  minutes,  for  example.  Equally  a  person 
might make a Psychoanalysis roll to help a delusional investi-
gator see through their hallucination for a brief period.

Treatment  by  a  psychotherapist  can  add  Sanity  points 

during indefinite insanity (see Sanity, page 154).

Psychoanalysis cannot increase a person’s Sanity points 

above 99–Cthulhu Mythos.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: standard therapy within a hospi-

tal setting.

i  Hard  difficulty:  intermittent  therapy  over  a  longer 

period.

Pushing  examples:  this  is  a  skill  which  can  be  attempted 
month  after  month  without  requiring  a  Pushed  skill  roll. 
However,  if  one  failed  the  skill  roll  in  a  given  month,  one 
might choose to push a roll during a single session on the 
following day with some form of radical intervention (if a 
quick result was required). For example, forcing a patient to 
face their fear by actively forcing them to confront its phys-
ical reality; getting the patient’s friends and close colleagues 
to actively participate in the therapy.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: curing the 
patient’s fear of spiders by locking them in a room full of 
tarantulas  backfires  as  the  patient  goes  berserk  (possible 
damage to self and to others) and now thinks they are the 
"spider  king"  (the  patient  now  has  a  new  mania  and  has 
lost additional Sanity points—the therapist should make a 
Sanity roll too, as their actions caused this!)

Much like the blind leading the blind, it is possible for 
an  insane  character  to  practice  psychoanalysis.  An  insane 
character who fails a pushed roll could seek to become a cult 
leader, with his or her patients as recruits.

Psychology (10%)
A  perception  skill  common  to  all  humans,  it  allows  the 
user  to  study  an  individual  and  form  an  idea  of  another 
person’s motives and character. The Keeper may choose to 
make concealed Psychology skill rolls on the player’s behalf, 
announcing only the information, true or false, that the user 
gained by employing it.

72 

Call of CthulhuOpposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Psychology can be used to oppose all forms of social inter-
action rolls: Intimidate, Fast Talk, Persuade, and Charm. It 
can also be used to see through someone’s disguise (such as 
when using the Disguise skill).

i  Regular  difficulty:  read  someone’s  intent  or  deter-
mine if the person is lying if their relevant skill (In-
timidate, Fast Talk, Persuade, and Charm) is below 
50%.

i  Hard difficulty: read someone’s intent or determine 
if  the  person  is  lying  if  their  relevant  skill  (Intim-
idate,  Fast  Talk,  Persuade,  and  Charm)  is  between 
50% and 89%.

Pushing examples:  being  very  unsubtle  and  asking  highly 
personal, intimate, or downright direct questions of the tar-
get; immersing yourself in data regarding a specific person 
(the target of your study) in order to think like them and 
understand their motivations.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: you some-
how  reveal  your  own  motivations  to  the  target;  the  target 
is offended by your prying questions or curious stare, and 
refuses  to  speak  with  you  further,  or  takes  action  against 
you (perhaps violence or a call to the police); unknown to 
you, the target is connected with your adversaries, and you 
unwittingly reveal your own agenda to them; spending all 
week locked in your room in order to build the profile has 
left you a physical and mental wreck (penalty die to all rolls 
until you recover).

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she be-
lieves that they hear the target’s evil thoughts, and launches 
a physical attack upon them.

Read Lips (01%) [Uncommon]
This skill allows the inquisitive investigator to listen in on a 
conversation, without requiring them to hear the speakers. 
Line of sight is necessary, and if only one speaker’s lips can be 
seen (the other presumably with their back to the lip reader) 
then only half of the conversation can be deciphered.

Read  Lips  may  also  be  used  to  silently  communicate 
with  another  person  (if  both  are  proficient),  allowing  for 
relatively complex phrasing and meaning.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Depending  on  the  situation,  Read  Lips  is  usually  unop-
posed. If attempting to read the lips of a target who wishes 
to remain hidden or unobserved, the skill may be opposed 
by the Stealth of the target.

i  Regular difficulty: understand the spoken commu-
nication  of  a  person  who  is  in  clear  sight  and  in 
relatively close proximity.

i  Hard  difficulty:  determine  the  spoken  commu-
nication  of  a  person  whose  mouth  is  occasionally 
obscured  and/or  is  some  distance  away  (e.g.  in  a 
large crowd of people).

Pushing examples: putting yourself in an obvious position 
and staring unsubtly at the target(s); filming the target (and 
thus likely to be observed filming the target).

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll:  the  target 
becomes  aware  that  you  are  watching  them  intently,  and 
takes  offense  and  confronts  you;  the  drunken  man  across 
the bar is angered, mistakenly thinking that you are looking 
at  him,  and  punches  you;  you  are  so  intent  on  the  target 
that  you  miss  what  is  happening  in  your  close  proximity 
(someone steals your case, or you walk into a lamp post).

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, there is plen-
ty of scope for imagining all manner of strange and bizarre 
things being said.

Ride (05%)
This  skill  is  intended  to  apply  to  saddle  horses,  donkeys, 
or mules, and grants knowledge of basic care of the riding 
animal, riding gear, and how to handle the steed at a gallop 
or on difficult terrain. Should a steed unexpectedly rear or 
stumble, the rider’s chance of remaining mounted equals his 
or  her  Ride  skill.  Riding  side-saddle  increases  the  level  of 
difficulty by one level. An unfamiliar mount (such as a cam-
el)  might  be  ridden  successfully,  but  the  level  of  difficulty 
would be higher.

If an investigator falls from a mount, either because the 
animal  has  collapsed,  fallen  or  died  (or  because  a  pushed 
Ride roll failed), at least 1D6 hit points are lost in the acci-
dent—although a Jump roll can negate this loss.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Basic  animal  handling  or  riding  a  mount  at  walking  pace 
does not require a ride roll.

i  Regular  difficulty:  riding  at  speed;  holding  onto  a 

scared mount.

i  Hard difficulty: riding a mount at speed in rough, 
unfamiliar  terrain  where  weather  conditions  are 
poor  (e.g.  a  heavily  wooded  forest  at  night  in  the 
pouring rain).

Pushing examples: whipping or pushing the mount aggres-
sively—perhaps  forcing  a  horse  to  jump  a  ravine  or  high 
ditch;  taking  the  risk  of  keeping  your  mount  rather  than 
jumping clear as trouble approaches.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  rider  is 
thrown  from  mount  and  takes  falling  damage;  mount  is 
injured; rider’s foot is entangled in the mount’s bridle and 
the rider ends up being dragged for some distance.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 

becomes obsessed with the animal.

Science (Specializations) (01%)
Practical  and  theoretical  ability  with  a  science  specialty 
would  suggest  some  degree  of  formalized  education  and 
training, although a well-read amateur scientist may also be 
a possibility. Understanding and scope is limited by the era 

73 

chapter 4: skills74 

Call of Cthulhuof play. You may spend skill points to purchase any skill spe-
cialization. The generic Science skill cannot be purchased.

Each specialty covers a particular discipline and the list 
given is not exhaustive. Many specialties cross and overlap 
in knowledge, for example Mathematics and Cryptography, 
Botany  and  Biology,  Chemistry  and  Pharmacy.  When  a 
character does not have the obvious discipline specialty, they 
may roll against an allied specialty with the level of difficulty 
increased (or penalty die) at the Keeper’s discretion. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

i  Regular difficulty: conducting an experiment; being 
aware of current scientific theory within your field 
of specialty: working with proper equipment.
i  Hard difficulty: conducting a particularly demanding 
experiment;  deciphering  disorganized/partial  scien-
tific records; working with improvised equipment.

Pushing examples: taking more time for study; conducting 
further research (perhaps in a better-equipped laboratory); 
consulting another expert; taking risks.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the exper-
iment  goes  completely  awry,  causing  unforeseen  damage 
(explosion,  fire,  electrical  shock,  expulsion  to  the  sixth 
dimension,  etc.);  you  incorrectly  prepare  the  formulae  for 
the magical powder, with disastrous results.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
begins  to  explore  an  aspect  of  weird  science  related  to 
their  specialization.  This  may  ultimately  lead  to  actual 
developments akin to those of Crawford Tillinghast (from 
Lovecraft’s story From Beyond).

Science Specializations:

Astronomy (01%): The user knows how to find out which 
stars and planets are overhead at a particular day or hour of 
the day or night, when eclipses and meteor showers occur, 
and  the  names  of  important  stars.  The  skill  also  provides 
knowledge  of  current  perceptions  about  life  on  other 
worlds,  the  existence  or  the  formation  of  galaxies,  and  so 
on. An academic might be able to calculate orbits, discuss 
stellar life cycles, and (in the modern day), have knowledge 
of infrared astronomy or long-baseline interferometry. 

Biology (01%): The study of life and living organisms, in-
cluding cytology, ecology, genetics, histology, microbiology, 
physiology, and so on. With this skill one might develop a 
vaccine against some hideous Mythos bacterium, isolate the 
hallucinogenic properties of some jungle plant, or perform 
analysis of blood and/or organic matter.

Botany  (01%):  The  study  of  plant  life,  including  classifica-
tion  of  species,  structure,  growth,  reproduction,  chemical 
properties, evolutionary principles, diseases, and microscopy. 
Sub-disciplines of botany include agronomy, forestry, horti-
culture, and paleobotany. With this skill one might identify 
the  properties  of  a  particular  plant  (whether  poisonous, 
edible, or psychotropic for example) and its particular uses. 

Chemistry  (01%):  A  study  of  the  composition  of  sub-
stances,  the  effects  of  temperature,  energy,  and  pressure 
upon  them,  as  well  as  how  they  affect  one  another.  With 
chemistry,  one  might  create  or  extract  complex  chemical 
compounds,  including  simple  explosives,  poisons,  gases, 
and  acids,  requiring  at  least  a  day  or  so  with  the  proper 
equipment  and  chemicals.  The  user  could  also  analyze  an 
unknown substance, given proper equipment and reagents. 

Cryptography  (01%):  The  study  of  secret  codes  and  lan-
guages  developed  by  one  or  more  persons  to  conceal  the 
contents of a conversation or message. A specialized branch 
of mathematics, this skill enables the identification, creation 
and/or deciphering of a code. Codes are usually written, but 
may take other forms, such as a message hidden within a mu-
sical composition, graphic art, or computer coding (in mod-
ern-day settings). Cracking a code can be painstaking work, 
often requiring lengthy research and number crunching. 

Engineering  (01%):  While  technically  not  a  science,  it  is 
grouped here for convenience. Science is about identifying 
certain  phenomena  (through  observing  and  recording), 
whereas engineering takes such findings and uses them to 
produce practical applications, such as machines, structures, 
and materials.

Forensics  (01%):  The  analysis  and  identification  of  evi-
dence. Normally associated with crime scene investigation 
(examination  of  fingerprints,  DNA,  hair,  and  body  fluids) 
and laboratory work in order to determine fact and provide 
expert witness and evidence for legal disputes. 

Geology (01%): Used to determine the approximate age of 
rock strata, recognize fossil types, distinguish minerals and 
crystals, locate promising sites for drilling or mining, eval-
uate soils, anticipate volcanism, seismic events, avalanches, 
and other such phenomena. 

Mathematics (10%):  The  study  of  numbers  and  logic,  in-
cluding mathematical theories and applied and theoretical 
solution design and development. The skill might allow the 
identification  of  non-Euclidian  geometries,  solve  puzzling 
formulae, and decrypt complex patterns or codes (see Cryp-
tography for specialized study of codes).

Meteorology (01%): The scientific study of the  atmosphere, 
including  weather  systems  and  patterns,  and  atmospheric 
phenomena. Use this skill to determine long-range weather 
patterns and to forecast effects like rain, snow, and fog.

Pharmacy  (01%):  The  study  of  chemical  compounds 
and  their  effect  on  living  organisms.  Traditionally  this  has 
involved the formulation, creation, and dispensing of medi-
cations (whether a witch-doctor using combination of herbs 
or  a  modern  pharmacist  operating  in  a  laboratory).  The 
application of this skill ensures the safe and effective use of  
pharmaceutical  drugs,  including  synthesizing  ingredients, 
identification of toxins, and knowledge of possible side effects.

75 

chapter 4: skillsPhysics  (01%):  Grants  theoretical  understanding  of  pres-
sure,  materials,  motion,  magnetism,  electricity,  optics, 
radioactivity,  and  related  phenomena,  and  some  ability  to 
construct experimental devices to test ideas. The degree of 
knowledge depends on the era of use. Practical devices, such 
as automobiles, are not the province of physicists, however 
experimental devices may be, perhaps in conjunction with 
Electronics or Mechanical Repair.

Zoology  (01%):  The  study  of    biology  that  relates  spe-
cifically  to  the  animal  kingdom,  including  the  structure, 
evolution,  classification, behavioral habits, and distribution 
of  animals, both living and extinct. Use this skill to iden-
tify animal species from interaction with the environment 
(tracks, droppings, marks, etc.), likely behaviors, and terri-
torial traits.

Sleight of Hand (10%) 
Allows the visual covering-up, secreting, or masking of an 
object or objects, perhaps with debris, cloth, or other inter-
vening or illusion-promoting materials, perhaps by using a 
secret panel or false compartment. Larger objects of any sort 
should be increasingly hard to conceal. 

Sleight of hand includes pick-pocketing, palming a card, 

and clandestine use of a cell phone.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Sleight  of  Hand  is  commonly  opposed  by  Spot  Hidden. 
Adjust the difficulty level according to the size of the task. 
If  it  is  a  small  item  (which  would  fit  in  a  pocket  or  up  a 
sleeve) that is being palmed or concealed, no adjustment is 
required. If the item is larger, the level of difficulty may be 
increased.

i  Regular  difficulty:  picking  the  pocket  of  someone 

with less than 50% Spot Hidden skill.

i  Hard difficulty: picking the pocket of someone with 

50% to 89% Spot Hidden skill.

Pushing  examples:  taking  more  time  to  study  the  target 
and  their  behaviors;  physically  touching  or  bumping  into 
the  target;  setting  up  an  elaborate  rig  inside  one’s  jacket 
to  conceal  a  card  or  loaded  dice;  having  someone  cause  a 
distraction.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  you  feel 
a policeman’s hand on your shoulder; while no one can 
prove you pick-pocketed the priceless diamond, some-
one has their suspicions and you begin to notice that 
for  the  last  week  you  have  been  tailed  by  a  myste-
rious  dark  figure;  you’re  caught  red-handed  and 
the mobster doesn’t take kindly to thieves! You’re 
taken out back and shown the business end of a 
couple of baseball bats.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed 

roll, he or she acts like a kleptomaniac.

Spot Hidden (25%)
This skill allows the user to spot a secret door or compart-
ment, notice a hidden intruder, find an inconspicuous clue, 
recognize  a  repainted  automobile,  become  aware  of  am-
bushers, notice a bulging pocket, or anything similar. This is 
an important skill in the armory of an investigator.

If a character has only a fleeting chance to spot something, 
perhaps while running past it, the Keeper may raise the level 
of difficulty. If the character is conducting a thorough search, 
the Keeper might award an automatic success. The difficulty 
level  might  also  be  adapted  to  reflect  the  environment,  it 
being harder to spot something in a cluttered room.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
When searching for a character who is hiding, the opponent’s 
Stealth skill is used to set the difficulty level for the roll.
i  Regular difficulty: searching a room for clues.
i  Hard  difficulty:  searching  for  something  that  has 

been purposefully well hidden.

Pushing  examples:  taking  more  time  to  observe  the  area; 
pulling  the  place  apart;  dismantling  the  furniture  and 
smashing the porcelain statuettes.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  inadver-
tently drop something of your own while searching, which 
will make it clear that you have been there (the investigator 
will not realize this at the time); you fail to the spot the paw 
print in the mud and are surprised when the red-eyed beast 
leaps  at  you  from  the  trees;  while  you  managed  to  find  a 
clue, you didn’t notice the cultists arriving home.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she is 
convinced that something is there and that they will find it 
under the wallpaper, hidden in the plaster, or beneath the 
floorboards.

Stealth (20%) 
The art of moving quietly and/or hiding, without alerting 
those who might hear or see. When attempting to avoid de-
tection, the player should attempt a Stealth skill roll. Ability 
with  the  skill  suggests  either  that  the  character  is  adept  at 
moving quietly (light-footed) and/or skilled in camouflage 
techniques. The skill might also suggest that the character 
can  maintain  a  level  of  patience  and  cool-headedness  to 

remain still and unseen for long periods.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 

When  attempting  to  hide,  the  opponent’s  Spot 
Hidden or Listen skill is used to set the difficulty 
level  for  the  roll.  Situational  modifiers  may 
also apply (e.g. darkness or loud noises).

i  Regular  difficulty:  moving  quietly 
around the house to avoid detection by 
average people (those with Spot Hid-
den and Listen skills of less than 50%).

76 

Call of Cthulhui  Hard  difficulty:  sneaking  past  an  attentive  guard 
dog; having only seconds to find a hiding place.

Pushing examples: taking more time to study the area; re-
moving your shoes; causing a distraction; sitting tight until 
the coast appears clear.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: unbeknown 
to you, you have been spotted and rather than approach you 
directly, the cultists decide to summon "something" to get 
you;  you  hear  the  cupboard  door  behind  which  you  are 
hiding being locked then nailed shut.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll the investiga-
tor may believe he or she is invisible, when in fact everyone 
can see them.

Survival (Specializations) (10%)
Knowledge  of  this  skill  provides  the  expertise  required  to 
survive in extreme environments, such as in desert or arctic 
conditions, as well as upon the sea or in wilderness terrain. 
Inherent  is  the  knowledge  of  hunting,  building  shelters, 
hazards  (such  as  the  avoidance  of  poisonous  plants),  etc., 
according to the given environment. 

You may spend skill points to purchase any skill special-
ization.  The  generic  "Survival"  skill  cannot  be  purchased. 
An  environment  specialism  should  be  determined  when 
this  skill  is  chosen,  for  example:  Survival  (Desert),  (Sea), 
(Arctic),  etc. When  a  character  does  not  have  the  obvious 
survival  specialty,  they  may  roll  against  an  allied  specialty 
with the level of difficulty increased (or penalty die) at the 
Keeper’s discretion. 

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Modifiers may be awarded for the conditions or situation, 
or where the character has no specialist skill for a particular 
environment.

i  Regular  difficulty:  find/make  shelter;  locate  water 

and sources of food.

i  Hard difficulty: as above but when weather condi-
tions are extreme and/or you are badly injured.

Pushing examples: trying something risky (e.g. drinking the 
water without purifying it first; eating unidentified berries); 
using  all  of  one’s  clothing  to  improve  a  shelter;  burning 
every possession to make a signal fire.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the cave you 
found is inhabited by a very angry bear; having burnt all of 
your clothes to make a signal fire, you have now given away 
your  position  to  your  pursuers—will  your  rescuers  reach 
you before the pursuers do?

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she be-
lieves themselves to be impervious to the elements and able to 
exist as a breatharian (able to exist without food and water).

Swim (20%)
The  ability  to  float  and  to  move  through  water  or  other 
liquid. Only roll Swim in times of crisis or danger, or when 
the Keeper judges it appropriate. Failing a pushed Swim roll 
can result in loss of hit points. It may also lead to the person 
being  washed  away  downstream,  partially  or  completely 
drowned.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Modifiers may be awarded for the conditions or situation. 
i  Swimming a length in the swimming pool: no roll 

required

i  Regular difficulty: swimming in a fast-moving cur-

rent.

i  Hard  difficulty:  swimming  against  a  rapid  current 
while fully dressed; adverse weather conditions.

Pushing examples: taking a big breath and really going for 
it with all your remaining strength; pushing your physical 
limits.

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the current 
pulls you under and you lose consciousness, awaking on an 
unknown  beach;  you  are  pulled  under  and  are  injured  by 
being dashed against rocks; you strive for the lifeboat and, 
just as you make it, you feel something cold and slimy grab 
your ankle.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
keeps  on  swimming  and  probably  considers  dry  ground 
dangerous for some reason.

Throw (20%)
To hit a target with an object or to hit a target with the right 
part  of  the  object  thrown  (such  as  the  blade  of  a  knife  or 
hatchet), use Throw. 

A palm-sized object of reasonable balance can be hurled 

up to STR in yards. 

If the Throw roll fails, the object lands at some random 
distance  from  the  target.  The  Keeper  should  compare  the 
closeness of the die roll result to the highest number which 
would have indicated success, and choose a distance between 
target and thrown object that feels comparable.

The Throw skill is used in combat when throwing knives, 

rocks, spears, grenades, or boomerangs.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
Modifiers might be applied for the weight of the object being 
thrown or, in the case of a very light object, the prevailing 
wind conditions.

i  Regular  difficulty:  throw  a  basketball  through  a 

hoop.

i  Hard difficulty: an accurate shot at a distance; throw 
a basketball through a hoop from center court.

Once an item has been thrown, it is quite literally out of 
the investigator’s hands and therefore  there is  nothing  the 
player can do to justify Pushing the roll. If multiple missiles 

77 

chapter 4: skillsare available, there is no risk connected with failure and it 
is only a matter of time until the investigator is successful, 
don’t roll dice. If multiple missiles are available and there is 
a distinct risk connected with failure then the Keeper might 
ask for a Pushed roll.

Pushing examples: taking more time to assess the distance 
or waiting some time for more favorable conditions; putting 
every ounce of strength into the throw and throwing your-
self as you launch the item; throwing a lot of items in quick 
succession hoping one will hit the target; taking a massive 
run-up  and  risking  your  momentum  taking  you  over  the 
ravine.

Sample  Consequences  of  failing  a  Pushed  roll:  you  send 
the object flying to your companion as you stumble and fall, 
hitting  your  head  against  the  jagged  rocks;  you  throw  too 
hard and the object flies over the high church wall into the 
graveyard;  the  dynamite  stick  slips  from  your  hand—you 
look for it in vain but fail to see it in your hood, and only 
then do you smell the burning fuse.

If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she will 

refuse to let go of the item to be thrown.

Track (10%)
With Track, an investigator can follow a person, vehicle, or 
animal over earth and through plants/leaves. Factors such as 
time passed since the tracks were made, rain, and the type of 
ground covered may affect the difficulty level.

Opposing skill/Difficulty level: 
If  tracking  someone  who  is  trying  to  conceal  their  tracks, 
the opponent’s Stealth skill should be used to set the diffi-
culty level; modifiers might also be applied for the prevailing 
weather and terrain.

i  Regular difficulty: tracking an animal or human in 
the forest under normal (temperate) conditions.
i  Hard difficulty: following a trail that is several (or 

more) days old.

Pushing examples:  backtracking  and  taking  more  time  to 
study  the  area;  walking  in  increasing  spirals  to  locate  the 
tracks (taking longer, possibly making more noise and mak-
ing oneself more visible). 

Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: the tracks 
you are following lead you directly into the path of a hun-
gry bear/lion/cannibal; you find yourself going round and 
round in circles, and night is falling as you realize you are 
now totally lost; you follow the tracks, only to be ambushed 
or caught in a trap laid by the thing you are following.

If  an  insane  investigator  fails  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she 
will compulsively follow any tracks (convinced they are the 
right ones) until they are physically restrained or convinced 
otherwise. 

Optional Rules

Specializations: Transferable Skill 
Benefit
Specializations are dealt with in one of two ways: 

G  Art and Craft, and Science skills are addressed under 

Skill Specializations on page 54.

G  In  the  case  of  Fighting,  Firearms,  Languages  (by 
grouping),  and  Survival,  the  specializations  contain 
much  that  is  common  and  transferable  from  one 
specialization  to  another.  For  example,  in  learning 
to  use  a  firearm,  there  are  more  similarities  than 
differences between the subdivisions of firearms. In 
the  case  of  fighting,  there  are  a  lot  of  transferable 
skills that any fighter will use (reaction times, judging 
range,  evasions,  feints,  timing,  spotting  openings, 
knowing where to hit, etc.). Contrast those compar-
isons with Astronomy and Pharmacy (in the case of 
Science). Thus, within Fighting, Firearms, Languages 
(by grouping), and Survival, the improvement of one 
specialization  has  a  transferable  benefit  to  all  other 
closely related specialisms. 

G  When a character first raises a specialization within 
one of these skills to 50% or over, all other related skill 
specializations are raised by 10 percentage points (but 
not  higher  than  50%).  This  may  happen  only  once 
more:  when  a  character  first  raises  a  specialization 
to  90%  or  over,  all  other  related  specializations  are 
again raised by 10 percentage points (but not higher 
than  90%).  During  investigator  creation  the  player 
may boost a specialization and gain the additional 10 
points in each of the others prior to spending further 
points in those other specializations.

Matthew  spends  25  skill  points  to  raise  his  Fighting 
(Brawl)  skill  to  50%.  Any  other  Fighting  specializa-
tions will gain a 10% point bonus to their base values. 
Fighting (Sword) now starts at 30% instead of 20%. 
He  then  spends  5  skill  points  to  raise  his  Fighting 
(Sword) skill to 35%. In play, Matthew’s investigator 
picks up an axe. Matthew did not put any skill points 
in the axe specialization, but since he has one Fighting 
specialization of 50%, his base chance with an axe is 
elevated by 10 percentage points to 25%. 

Brian  put  20  points  in  his  Fighting  (Brawl) 
specialization,  25  points  into  Fighting  (Axe)  and  12 
points into Fighting (Sword), thus these now stand at: 
Brawl 45%, Axe 45%, Sword 32%. In play, he gains a 
tick in Fighting (Brawl) and gains 7 points, raising the 
skill to 52%. This allows him to raise his other special-
izations by 10 points (but not above 50%), so his skills

Call of CthulhuLanguages
When  a  character  first  raises  a  language  (other  than  Own 
Language)  to  50%,  all  other  related  language  families  are 
raised by 10 percentage points (but not higher than 50%). 
This  may  happen  only  once  more:  when  a  character  first 
raises  a  language  (other  than  Own  Language)  to  90%,  all 
other related languages within that family are raised by 10 
percentage  points  (but  not  higher  than  90%).  For  exam-
ple,  related  family  categories  include  Germanic  (English, 
German,  Dutch),  Slavic  (Russian,  Czech,  Polish,  etc.),  Ni-
ger-Congo (Swahili, Zulu, Yoruba, etc.) 

Note this is in no way an exhaustive list of the possible 
language  families,  and  Keepers  opting  to  use  this  rule  are 
recommended to refer to standard encyclopedia entries for 
“language families.”

chapter 4: skillshis  chapter  details  the  Call  of  Cthulhu  game 
rules  that  are  used  to  ensure  fairness  and 
balance,  as  well  as  to  resolve  conflicts  and 
challenges as they arise in play. 

When to Roll Dice

There is a large amount of fun to be had playing a roleplay-
ing  game,  and  much  of  it  is  derived  from  discussing  your 
character’s actions with your fellow players (and the Keeper) 
without  rolling  any  dice  whatsoever.  Players  declare  what 
their investigators are doing and often speak "in character" 
to  better  express  themselves.  The  Keeper  states  what  the 
non-player characters (NPCs) are doing, and describes the 
world  around  the  investigators.  So  far  so  good.  Everyone 
accepts what everyone else says and builds upon it to create 
an interesting story. Until, of course, they don’t accept what 
someone else is saying. For example, an investigator doesn’t 
believe what Old Man Marsh (played by the Keeper) is saying 
about the whereabouts of the missing library books. When 
someone  says  something  that  you  don’t  like,  you  can  ask 
for clarification or you can disagree—but ultimately, if you 
don’t accept what someone says about what’s happening in 
the story, the situation can be resolved with dice. Likewise, 
you  could  simply  say  that  your  investigator  managed  to 
climb to the top of the church steeple in the pouring rain 
at  midnight—however  if  there’s  no  dice  roll  to  test  your 
investigator’s skill, there’s no tension or drama either!

Equally there’s no need to roll dice for everything. For 
example, each investigator has a Drive Auto skill,  but dice 
don’t need to be rolled every time an investigator gets in a 
car—that would be just dull! If you say your investigator is 
driving to the local historical society, unless someone takes 
issue with you, then it’s done. Simply move on with the sto-
ry. Normal day-to-day stuff that everyone "just does" should 
be just that—no dice needed.

However,  if  the  Keeper  describes  a  car  full  of  cultists 
attempting  to  push  the  investigator’s  car  off  the  road,  the 
player may object to this. The player could say, “Hold on, I’m 
putting my foot down and getting away,” but still the Keeper 
may insist the cultists are barging the investigator’s car off the 
road. There’s a disagreement, a conflict—a reason to roll dice 
and see whether the investigator’s car is indeed pushed into 
the  ditch.  The  story  has  reached  a  moment  of  tension  that 
requires a definite outcome. Time to reach for the dice!

Skill Rolls
The word "roll" is used in conjunction with the appropriate 
skill or characteristic; thus the Keeper will, for example, call 
for a "Climb roll" or a "Strength roll".

The Keeper has the final say about which skill or char-
acteristic is appropriate to roll, depending on the situation 
and the nature of the opposition. The term "skill roll" is used 
regardless of whether a skill or a characteristic is used.

The Keeper’s 
Decision is Final
While the Call of Cthulhu 
rules are designed to be as 
clear and flexible as possible, 
from time to time you may 
encounter a situation in the 
game for which the rules 
do not provide a solution. 
In such circumstances the 
Keeper’s decision is final. 
Players are encouraged to 
offer suggestions and ideas, 
however the players should 
respect the Keeper’s decision 
and move on with the game.

The  player  should  be  clear  about  what  they  want  to 
achieve by stating a goal before rolling any dice. If the goal 
isn’t  acceptable,  the  Keeper  should  help  the  player  to  re-
phrase it. The goal should define the player’s objective clear-
ly and concisely. For advice on setting goals see Chapter 10: 
Playing the Game.

Harvey Walters wants to force a door open. The Keeper 
might assume that he is simply bashing the door and 
creating a loud noise in the process. If Harvey wants 
to open the door quietly, he needs to state this as his 
goal. Thus ‘break the door down’ and ‘lever the door 
open quietly’ are two different goals, and the Keeper 
will consider the complexity of the goal when setting 
a difficulty level.

Skill Roll: Determining the Difficulty 
Level
The  Keeper  determines  the  difficulty  level  for  skill  rolls. 
There are three levels of difficulty in Call of Cthulhu: Regu-
lar, Hard, and Extreme. 

Regular difficulty level: an average example of what would 
challenge a competent person. The player needs to roll equal 
to or below their full skill or characteristic in order to suc-
ceed. This should be used in the vast majority of cases.

Hard difficulty level: this task would challenge a profession-
al. The player needs to roll equal to or below a half of their 
skill or characteristic in order to succeed. This should only 
be used occasionally.

Extreme  difficulty  level:  this  task  would  challenge  an  ex-
pert;  it  is  on  the  border  of  what  is  humanly  possible.  The 

82 

Call of Cthulhuplayer needs to roll equal to or below a fifth of their skill or 
characteristic in order to succeed. This should be reserved 
for extreme situations.

If you, as Keeper, feel that the task is easy then don’t ask 

for a dice roll. Save dice rolls for challenging situations.

If the investigator is facing a living being, the difficulty 
level should be set according to the complementary skill or 
characteristic belonging to that being (human or otherwise). 
It is up to the Keeper to decide which skill or characteristic 
would be used by the opponent to counter the investigator’s 
actions—examples can be found with each skill entry (see 
Chapter 4: Skills).

i  If the opponent’s skill or characteristic is below 50, 

the difficulty level is Regular.

i  If the opponent’s skill or characteristic is equal to or 

above 50, the difficulty level is Hard. 

i  If the opponent’s skill or characteristic is equal to or 

above 90, the difficulty level is Extreme. 

Harvey Walters is trying to persuade the librarian to 
allow him access to the library on a Sunday, when the 
library  is  normally  closed.  The  Keeper  considers  the 
librarian’s  Persuade  and  Psychology  skills  (the  two 
skills which are used to oppose Persuade). Neither of 
these is above 50% and so the difficulty level is Regu-
lar, requiring Harvey’s player to roll equal to or below 
Harvey’s full Persuade skill in order to succeed. 

 Harvey failed to persuade the librarian to open 
up, so he has decided to force open the back door of 
the library. Harvey has a STR of 20. The library door 
is made of thick oak, with a stout iron lock, and the 
Keeper judges it to be particularly strong. The difficul-
ty level is thus set to Hard, requiring Harvey to roll 10 
or below (half Harvey’s STR).

In the case of non-living opponents, the Keeper must act 
as judge, weighing up the pertinent factors. A standard chal-
lenge  would  be  of  Regular  difficulty.  Where  the  challenge 
is clearly beyond Regular difficulty, the Keeper may use the 
Hard difficulty level. If the challenge is exceptionally diffi-
cult but still within the bounds of what is humanly possible, 
the Keeper should use the Extreme difficulty level. 

Wherever possible, the situation should be framed in such 
a way that the dice are being rolled by the player. Players won’t 
get much fun out of watching the Keeper roll the dice every 
time. If the investigator is attempting to use their Stealth skill 
to  furtively  follow  a  non-player  character,  the  player  would 
roll the dice and the Keeper would use the non-player charac-
ter’s Spot Hidden skill to set the difficulty level. If the situation 
were reversed and the non-player character were following the 
investigator, the player would roll the dice against their Spot 
Hidden skill to see if the tail is spotted, but this time Keeper 
would  use  the  non-player  character’s  Stealth  skill  to  set  the 
difficulty level. Remember, the players should be rolling the 
dice more often than the Keeper.

"Sorry, the library is closed!"

See Chapter 10: Playing the Game for more advice on 

setting difficulty levels.

Remember, only roll the 
dice if it’s a moment 
of tension. Dice rolls 
are not needed when 
characters undertake 
mundane and everyday 
tasks.

Rolling the 
Dice: Success 
or Failure
There  are  two  possible 
outcomes  of  a  roll: 
success or failure. The 
various  divisions  of 
skill  (fifth,  half,  full)  do 
not equate with graduations of success. The player states a goal 
and then rolls the dice. If the dice roll is equal to or below the 
required number, the goal is fully achieved. If the dice roll is 
below a half or a fifth of the specified skill, the goal will not 
necessarily  be  performed  to  a  higher  standard.  Any  further 
interpretation of the roll is at the discretion of the Keeper.

Success
If the player has rolled equal to or under the target set by the 
Keeper, their investigator has achieved the goal that was set 
and agreed before the roll. The player should be encouraged 
to participate in describing the outcome. This can include 
aspects of the story beyond his or her investigator, such as 
the actions of non-player characters and the environment; 
however, such things may be moderated by the Keeper. Thus 
both player and Keeper are involved in describing the out-
come of a successful roll.

83 

chapter 5: game systemHarvey  drives  his  car  directly  at  a  shambling  hu-
man-like  monster  with  the  goal  of  hitting  it.  The 
Keeper declares that the difficulty level to hit it will be 
hard (given it has a Dodge skill of 60). The player rolls 
less than half of her investigator’s Drive Auto skill—a 
success! The player describes the scene...

“I  push  down  the  accelerator  and  ram  into  the 
shambling thing, knocking it flying. I brake hard, spin 
the  car  to  a  halt  and  jump  out,  leaving  the  engine 
running. I draw my pistol and fire three shots into the 
monster’s corpse.”

There’s no need to take issue with the player’s de-
scription of Harvey’s cool driving technique—it is just 
description—but  did  he  really  kill  the  monster? The 
Keeper  checks  the  monster’s  hit  points  and  considers 
that it would take more than this to kill it. The play-
er’s goal was  to hit the monster with the car (which 
she did), not to kill it. The Keeper jumps in, slightly 
altering what the player has said...

“Great, but when you get out of your car and look 
around there’s no sign of a body; the thing you hit with 
your car is nowhere to be seen.”

Alternatively,  the  Keeper  (referring  to  Other 
Forms of Damage on page 123) could ask the player 
to roll dice to see exactly how much damage the car 
did to the monster. Determining that the monster is 
definitely not dead yet, the Keeper amends the latter 
part of what the player said...

“As you reach for your pistol, you see the shambling 
thing  emerge  from  the  foliage.  It  looks  undamaged 
and very, very angry.”

Failure
The player stated a goal and has failed to achieve it, but exactly 
how  the  player’s  investigator  has  failed  is  entirely  up  to  the 
Keeper (though of course the players may throw in suggestions). 
Initial failure at a skill roll should not usually inflict damage 
or Sanity loss, but this depends on the circumstances. A failed 
roll could represent failure to act rather than a failed attempt. 
Worse things may happen if the player chooses to push the roll 
and fails a second time (see Pushing the Roll). Save "what’s the 
worst that could happen?" style consequences for pushed rolls.

Harvey  fails  his  Climb  skill  roll  as  he  attempts  to 
descend  from  an  upper  floor  window  to  the  street 
below. The Keeper describes the lack of handholds and 
that  the  nearby  drainpipe  feels  loose.  Harvey’s  goal 
was to get safely to the ground, and this has not been 
achieved—Harvey  is  still  stuck  where  he  was  before 
the  dice  roll.  Note  how  the  Keeper  did  not  take  the 
situation  to  its  extreme,  that  of  Harvey  falling  and 
suffering harm, as it made sense that Harvey would 
hesitate when he realized the danger.

Harvey speeds towards the monster.

Pushing the Roll

...the essence of pure nightmare was upon me. Sanity depart-
ed—and, ignoring everything except the animal impulse of 
flight, I merely struggled and plunged upward over the incline’s 
debris as if no gulf had existed. Then I saw the chasm’s edge, 
leaped frenziedly with every ounce of strength I possessed, and 
was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniae vortex of loathsome 
sound and utter, materially tangible blackness.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Shadow Out Of Time

Pushing  a  skill  roll  provides  the  player  with  a  second  and 
final attempt to achieve a goal. A pushed roll is only allowed 
if  it  can  be  justified,  and  it  is  up  to  the  player  to  do  this. 
Whenever a player asks, “Can I push the roll?” the Keeper 
should always ask, “What action are you taking to push the 
situation?” It is not for the Keeper to simply say yes or no; it 
is for the player to describe the extra effort or time taken to 
justify the pushed roll. If the player is stuck, other players or 
the Keeper might offer suggestions. 

By making a pushed roll, the player is upping the ante 
and giving the Keeper permission to bring dire consequenc-
es  should  the  roll  be  failed  a  second  time.  Pushing  a  roll 
means pushing the situation to the limit: 

T  If  you  are  breaking  down  a  door,  it  may  mean 
throwing yourself at it with no heed for your own 
safety.

T  If you are persuading a police officer, it may mean 

risking arrest.

84 

Call of CthulhuT  If  you  are  searching  a  room,  it  may  mean  turning 
it  over  and  risking  breaking  things,  or  spending 
too long there when you know the bad guys might 
return at any moment.

T  If you are trying to read someone with Psychology, 
it  may  mean  studying  a  person  that  little  bit  too 
closely, or asking some very prying questions.
T  If you are picking a lock, it may mean using a little 
too much force. Something may break, but what will 
it be? The lock or your lock picks?

T  If it involves Cthulhu Mythos, you may risk staring 
into  the  abyss  of  dark  knowledge  for  so  long  that 
something looks back at you.

T  If you are climbing a wall, it may mean continuing 

even though it feels completely unsafe.

T  If  you  are  reading  a  tome,  it  may  mean  obsessing 
over  every  page,  reading  and  rereading  obsessively 
until you can correlate the contents.

It is important to note that a pushed roll is not simply a 
re-roll; time always passes between rolls—it may be seconds 
or hours. 

When  making  a  pushed  roll,  the  goal  must  still  be 
achievable.  The  skill  and  difficulty  level  normally  remain 
unchanged, but may be modified if the situation changes.

Only  skill  and  characteristic  rolls  can  be  pushed,  not 
Luck,  Sanity,  or  combat  rolls,  or  rolls  to  determine  an 
amount of damage or Sanity loss.

Foreshadowing Failure

So haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he 
come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was  
repeating them under his breath.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward

Before rolling the dice for a pushed roll, the consequence of 
failure may be foreshadowed by the Keeper. To foreshadow, 
the Keeper says, “If you fail…” followed by as much detail 
as  he  or  she  desires.  The  Keeper  should  highlight  things 
that would be apparent to the investigator (though perhaps 
unconsidered  by  the  player).  Things  that  the  investigator 
would  not  be  aware  of  might  only  be  hinted  at  (at  the 
Keeper’s discretion). Players are welcome to offer their own 
suggestions for consequences, especially when they come up 
with scarier ones!

There are two reasons why the Keeper should foreshadow 
the consequence:

i  The  player  requests  foreshadowing  to  clarify  the 
dangers  (as  the  investigator  would  be  aware  of 
them), so that they can gauge the risk.

i  The Keeper chooses to foreshadow to highlight the 
danger or to increase the drama of the situation.

It is imperative that the Keeper focuses on an interesting 

consequence, rather than flat failure. 

More advice on foreshadowing is offered in Chapter 10: 

Playing the Game. 

 Harvey is fleeing from pursuing cultists. His player 
declares that Harvey is trying to hide behind a mar-
ket  stall  positioned  in  the  main  street.  The  Keeper 
determines that this requires a Stealth roll at Regular 
difficulty. Harvey’s player rolls high and fails the roll. 
The  Keeper  describes  the  stall  as  being  little  more 
than  a  few  boxes  on  the  pavement,  with  nowhere 
to  hide  behind.  Believing  it’s  only  a  matter  of  time 
before he is caught, Harvey’s decides to try to hide in 
plain  sight,  among  the  passing  crowds,  hoping  that 
the  cultists  won’t  see  him  in  the  throng  of  people. 
The Keeper approves this for a pushed roll. Harvey is 
taking a bigger risk—he’s effectively making himself 
easier to spot, and so will have no chance of escape if 
the pushed roll is failed.

Harvey’s player makes a second Stealth roll, this 
time succeeding! Harvey’s quick thinking means that 
he melts away into the crowd. The cultists have lost 
him this time!

"Run! Run for your life!"

85 

chapter 5: game systemUsing the previous example, Harvey’s player has de-
clared she would like to try to push the failed Stealth 
roll and described what Harvey is doing to justify this. 
The player then asks the Keeper for the likely conse-
quence if the pushed roll is failed. The Keeper thinks 
for a moment and says, “Well, as Harvey is trying to 
mingle with the crowd of people in the street—if the 
pushed roll is failed he could well find himself bump-
ing into one of the pursuing cultists and be caught.”

Pushed Roll: Success

The player’s goal is achieved as it would have been for the 
original roll. None of the consequences of failure happen.

Pushed Roll: Failure

Failing  a  pushed  roll  grants  the  Keeper  free  rein  over  the 
outcome,  including  damage,  Sanity  checks,  loss  of  equip-
ment,  isolation  from  the  rest  of  the  investigators,  capture, 
and so on. The Keeper can even incorporate the player’s goal 
being  achieved  (even  though  the  player  failed  the  pushed 
roll), but at some form of cost. 

When a player fails a pushed roll, he or she is giving the 
Keeper license to make the investigators’ lives more difficult. 
A  consequence  should  steer  the  game  towards  the  theme 
of horror, taking the investigators one step nearer to their 
doom. A player gets to push a skill roll and, if he or she fails, 
the Keeper gets to push the horror back in that player’s face.

 In the previous example, instead of succeeding in the 
pushed Stealth roll let's say Harvey failed it. The Keeper 
now has license to make matters far worse for Harvey.

“As Harvey tries to blend into the crowd, he finds 
himself jostled as he goes against the flow of people. He 
is pushed against a market stall, knocking it and himself 
over (Harvey takes 1 point of damage). As Harvey falls 
to the pavement, fruit falling on his head, the sudden 
noise of his cry makes the crowd part around him. He 
looks up to see everyone staring at him, including the 
cultists  who  were  in  pursuit.  They  quickly  shout  out, 
“He’s  our  friend!”  as  they  come  forward  and  grab 
Harvey. The crowd of people seem satisfied, and no one 
notices the dagger that one the cultists is now holding 
to Harvey’s ribs as they manhandle him in toan alley. 

Between a rock and a hard place!
i  A setback: a loss of equipment or the death of an ally.
i  The investigator is taken captive rather than killed.
i  A deal: rather than killing the investigator, the ene-

my offers a pact or deal.

i  Fainting: it is perfectly Lovecraftian for a character 
to  faint,  only  to  awaken  later  to  find  themselves 
unharmed and the situation changed.

Harvey is fleeing through underground tunnels, pur-
sued by ghouls. He sees an abyss before him. Perhaps 
he can leap across to the other side. He fails his Jump 
roll. There is really nothing he can do to push this roll. 
The  Keeper  could  simply  describe  Harvey  falling  to 
his  death,  which  would  end  the  game  for  Harvey’s 
player.  Alternatively,  the  Keeper  could  describe  how 
Harvey falls and lands in an underground river, later 
to  be  washed  up,  injured  and  lost  at  an  unknown 
location, his flashlight and equipment lost. The first 
outcome  will  bring  the  game  to  a  sudden  end  and, 
while this may be acceptable, the second allows for the 
game to continue.

Failed Dice Rolls and Sudden Endings
Where  possible  try  to  avoid  an  outcome  that  will  end  the 
game (unless you wish to, of course). Try to be creative and 
describe an outcome that allows for play to proceed, but not 
in the way the players intended. Rather than sudden death, 
consider other options such as:

More Than One Player Rolling Dice 
for a Skill Roll?
In some circumstances two or more characters may work 
together towards the same goal. The decision of how many 
investigators may be involved in a particular situation is up 
to the Keeper. 

86 

Call of Cthulhu87 

chapter 5: game systemExamples include:
i  Researching a single book: one person at a time may 

read the book.

i  Picking a lock: one person may attempt to pick the 

lock, rolling their Locksmith skill.

i  Delivering  First  Aid:  two  people  may  assist  each 
other, both rolling their First Aid skill. A success is 
granted if either of them succeeds. 

i  Carrying  a  body:  the  Keeper  should  use  the  SIZ 
characteristic of the body to set the difficulty level. 
Up to four people, each taking one limb, could assist 
one another in carrying a body, in which case a roll 
would only be required if the body were exception-
ally heavy (see Physical Human Limits for guidance 
on combining physical characteristics).

i  Library  Use  in  a  public  library:  all  investigators  in 
the library may conduct research and attempt a skill 
roll. Only one successful roll is required.

i  Spotting a clue: everyone who is in the right posi-
tion to view whatever is in question may roll Spot 
Hidden. Only one successful roll is required.
i  Determining if someone is withholding information: 
everyone who is able to observe the subject may roll 
Psychology. Only one successful roll is required.
i  Sneaking past a guard: Everyone needs to roll their 
Stealth  skill;  if  one  person  fails,  the  guard  will  be 
alerted to their presence.

The examples above are intended only as guidelines. For 
tasks in which the number of participants is limited, further 
attempts may be made by other investigators, but such at-
tempts will take additional time.

It may not be apparent in some situations whether an-
other skill roll should be allowed or if a player is required to 
push a skill roll; the Keeper must decide. In general, when an 
investigator is attempting the same goal a second time, this 
requires a pushed roll.

The  Keeper  allows  two  investigators  to  administer 
First Aid to a fallen comrade. Each player rolls dice; 
if    both  fail  the  skill  roll,  they  may  either  continue 
with their efforts (pushing the roll) or they can move 
aside and allow other investigators to attempt it (up 
to two at a time). Each attempt to administer first aid 
takes time, and this may be crucial if the patient is at 
death’s door.

Another example: The players wish to interrogate 
a  cultist,  and  decide  to  use  the  classic  good  cop,  bad 
cop routine. One player uses Intimidate  and another 
uses Charm. They take it in turns to play their roles, 
each rolling dice to test if the cultist cracks. Once the 
investigators have each made one dice roll, they must 
either give up, or one of them must push the roll. 

Physical Human Limits
The  investigators  are  only  human,  and  there  are  limits  to 
what they can achieve physically. As has already been stated, 
the difficulty level of a roll is Extreme when opposed by a 
characteristic of 90 or above. The upper limit of what can be 
faced with an Extreme success is 100 + the investigator’s skill 
or  characteristic.  Anything  beyond  this  is  impossible  for 
that character, and no dice roll is allowed. Thus no human 
can win a test of STR versus a large monster such as a Dark 
Young (STR 220).

The  only  way  to  exceed  human  limits  is  for  multiple 
investigators  to  combine  their  efforts.  One  or  more  inves-
tigators’  characteristics  are  deducted  from  the  opponent’s 
characteristic  to  reduce  it  to  a  level  against  which  other 
investigators may make a skill roll. To do this, starting with 
the lowest, deduct each investigator’s characteristic value in 

Cecil’s fellow investigator, Rodger, is trapped beneath 
a  fallen  rafter.  The  Keeper  rules  that  the  rafter  has 
a  SIZ  of  150.  Cecil’s  STR  is  only  40,  which  is  more 
than 100 below the rafter’s SIZ, making it impossible 
for him to lift it on his own, according to the rule on 
physical human limits.

Luckily, Martin (STR 45) is there to help. Cecil’s 
STR is lowest, so it is subtracted first from the rafter’s 
SIZ, leaving the rafter’s SIZ at 110 (150–40). This is 
over 90, but less than 100 points above Martin’s STR, 
so he can attempt a skill roll to move the rafter, requir-
ing an Extreme success. Martin fails this roll.

Cecil has STR 40; the most he can attempt to lift 

is SIZ 140.

Martin has STR 45; the most he can attempt to 

lift is SIZ 145.

At that moment the rest of the group arrive. There 
are now five investigators attempting to lift the rafter: 
Cecil (STR 40), Harvey (STR 20), Martin (STR 45), 
Helen (STR 60) and Belinda (STR 75). 

Harvey has STR 20; the most he can attempt to 

lift is SIZ 120.

Helen has STR 60; the most she can attempt to lift 

is SIZ 160.

Belinda has STR 75; the most she can attempt to 

lift is SIZ 175.

Subtracting  Harvey’s  STR  from  the  rafter  leaves 
SIZ  130;  deducting  Cecil’s  STR  then  leaves  SIZ  90; 
finally, subtracting Martin’s STR leaves SIZ 45. This 
has reduced the difficulty level to Regular. The Keeper 
rules  that  they  can  all  lay  hands  on  the  rafter  and 
attempt  the  lift,  but  since  one  attempt  has  already 
been made, that this will constitute a pushed skill roll. 
Neither Helen’s nor Belinda’s STRs have been factored 
in yet, so they are both able to attempt the pushed skill 
roll to lift the rafter. Helen rolls a success, Belinda rolls 
a failure. One success was all that was needed. Rodger 
is freed.

turn  from  the  opposition’s  characteristic.  Continue  doing 
this until the opponent’s characteristic has been reduced to a 
value that can be challenged by an investigator. Investigators 
whose characteristics were not used to reduce the opposing 
factor may now make a skill roll, with an Extreme, Hard, or 
Regular difficulty level, as determined by the new value of 
the opposing characteristic. 

This  rule  is  only  generally  applicable  to  physical  chal-
lenges in which characters can use their shared Strength or 
Size to achieve a task. The opposition cannot be reduced to 
zero or lower by this method; a skill roll is always required.

Fumbles and Criticals
I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror 

made him scream out so insanely—a horror which, I feel 

sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his present breakdown.

—H.P. Lovecraft, At The Mountains Of Madness

01: A Critical Success
A roll of 01 means that something beneficial occurs beyond 
simply achieving the goal. The nature of the good fortune 
is at the Keeper’s discretion, although the players may make 
suggestions. In combat, for example, a critical success means 
that the attacker has hit a vulnerable spot and causes maxi-
mum damage.

Brian  is  attempting  to  appraise  an  unusual  gold 
crown, and rolls 01 with his Appraise skill of 35%. The 
Keeper tells Brian that not only is he able to determine 
an accurate monetary value for the crown (the normal 
outcome for a Regular success), he also identifies that 
the crown is from the South Seas, possibly one of the 
fabled  items  brought  back  by  Captain  Marsh  in  the 
1830s (as a result of the critical success).

Very  high  or  very  low  dice  rolls  are  unusual,  and  signify 
good or bad fortune for the players.

The impact of Fumbles should take effect immediately 

and may not be negated through pushing the roll.

96—100: Fumble
A fumble simply means that something really bad occurs—
something worse than a straight failure. The nature of the 
misfortune or bad luck is at the Keeper’s discretion. 

89 

chapter 5: game systemIf the dice roll required for success is 50 or over and the 

dice read 100, a fumble has occurred.

If the dice roll required for success is below 50 and the 

dice read 96—100, a fumble has occurred.

Brian  encounters  a  ghoul.  Making  his  Sanity  roll 
he rolls 100—a fumble. He automatically takes the 
maximum Sanity point loss for seeing the ghoul.

Another example: Harvey has 55% Library Use 
skill.  If  he  were  searching  the  library  for  clues,  the 
Keeper might ask for a Library Use roll. Given that 
his skill is 55%, he will only fumble on a roll of 100. 
If Harvey were furtively searching through a private 
library in the dark, with only a candle for light, the 
Keeper might set the difficulty level to Hard, requir-
ing a roll of 27. In this case, Harvey would fumble on 
a roll of 96 to 100.

Luck
Luck  rolls  may  be  called  for  by  the  Keeper  when  circum-
stances  external  to  any  investigator  are  in  question,  and 
also when determining the fickle hand of fate. If a skill or 
characteristic is applicable to a situation then it should be 
used rather than Luck. 

If  the  Keeper  calls  for  a  Group  Luck  roll,  the  player 
whose investigator has the lowest Luck score (among those 
present in the scene) should make the roll.

If something bad is deemed to happen to one member 
of the group, the Keeper can simply ask who has the lowest 
Luck score at that moment and have that individual suffer 
the unfortunate event.

You  will  also  find  an  optional  rule  for  spending  Luck 

points to alter dice rolls at the end of this chapter.

 Finding a cab doesn’t require a dice roll, but getting 
one before the investigators lose sight of the car that 
they wish to pursue could. Credit Rating could be a 
factor in attracting the attention of a cabdriver on the 
lookout for a well-dressed fare who may tip generous-
ly.  However,  quickly  getting  a  ride  at  two  o’clock  in 
the  morning  on  the  undesirable  side  of  town  might 
not be so easy. Would there even be a cab to hail? No 
skill is going to make a cab appear at that moment. It 
is a matter of chance whether a cab may be driving 
down that road, hence a Luck roll is required.

Intelligence Rolls and Idea Rolls
An Intelligence (INT) roll may be called for by the Keeper 
when  an  investigator  is  attempting  to  solve  an  intellectual 
puzzle of some kind. By rolling equal to or below the inves-
tigator’s Intelligence, the player will receive a solution from 

the Keeper. This might include solving a crossword puzzle 
or answering a riddle.

An Idea roll is different than an Intelligence roll, although 
made in the same manner by rolling equal to or below the 
investigator’s Intelligence characteristic. An Idea roll is usually 
proposed by the players when their investigators have become 
stuck at a point in the investigation; perhaps they have com-
pletely missed a vital clue, or just don’t know what to do next, 
and so the game has stalled. The outcome of the Idea roll will 
get  the  investigation  back  on  track;  however,  the  success  or 
failure of the Idea roll determines whether the missed clue has 
been obtained easily, or at some cost to the investigators (see 
Chapter 10 for more advice about Idea rolls). 

Know Roll
All  people  know  bits  of  information  about  different  top-
ics.  The  Know  roll  represents  what’s  stored  in  the  brain’s 
intellectual  attic,  calculated  as  the  percentage  chance  that 
the investigator’s education supplied the information. Roll 
equal to or under a character’s EDU value to determine the 
success of a Know roll.

The  investigator  might  know  it  is  dangerous  to  pour 
water  into  sulfuric  acid  (without  studying  Chemistry),  or 
be  able  to  remember  the  geography  of  Tibet  (without  a 
Navigate roll), or know how many legs arachnids have (and 
possess only one percentile of Biology).

Identification  of  present-day  earthly  languages  is  an 
excellent use for the Know roll. If a specific skill is more ap-
plicable to the situation, then it should be used rather than 
making a Know roll (at the Keeper’s discretion).

Opposed Skill Rolls:  
Player versus Player  
and Melee Combat
There  may  be  times,  such  as  when  two  investigators  are 
opposing  one  another,  when  you  wish  for  both  sides  to 
roll dice to determine a victor. Opposed rolls are the stan-
dard  for  melee  combat  (see  Chapter 6: Combat).  Outside 
of  combat,  the  Keeper  should  avoid  using  opposed  rolls 
between  non-player  characters  and  investigators.  However 
once a Keeper is accustomed to these rules, he or she may 
wish to use an opposed roll where they feel it will enhance 
the drama.

To make an opposed roll, both sides declare a mutually 
exclusive  goal:  one  will  win,  the  other  will  lose.  Each  side 
selects a skill or a characteristic to use —not necessarily the 
same one—both of which must be approved by the Keeper. 
Both  sides  roll  dice  to  determine  a  level  of  success  by 
comparing their rolls with their chosen skill or characteris-
tic. The Keeper should be aware that characteristics are usu-
ally higher than skills, so where one side uses a characteristic 
the other side should be given the choice of whether to use a 
characteristic or a skill.

Opposed skill rolls cannot be pushed.

90 

Call of CthulhuA skill roll can yield one of six results:

Fumble: the roll is 100. If the roll required for success is less 
than 50, a roll of 96 or over is a fumble.

Failure: the roll is above the character’s skill or characteristic 
(but not a fumble).

In most cases, the Keeper would boost or penalize a roll 
with a single "bonus die" or "penalty die," but where condi-
tions are highly advantageous or dire, a second bonus die or 
penalty die could be applied.
One  bonus  die  and 
one  penalty  die  cancel 
each other out.

Regular success: the roll is equal to or below the character’s 
skill or characteristic.

For each bonus die: 

Hard success: the roll is equal to or below a half of the char-
acter’s skill or characteristic.

Extreme success: the roll is equal to or below a fifth of the 
character’s skill or characteristic.

Critical success: a roll of 01.

Comparing Results:

A Critical success beats an Extreme success.
An Extreme success beats a Hard success.
A Hard success beats a Regular success.
A Regular success beats a Failure or Fumble.

In  the  case  of  a  tie,  the  side  with  the  higher  skill  (or 
characteristic) wins. If still tied, either an impasse has been 
reached or both sides should re-roll.

Harvey gets drawn into a game of chess with Edgar, 
another  investigator.  There  is  nothing  riding  on  the 
outcome  of  the  game,  but  the  players  still  want  to 
know  who  wins.  Both  sides  have  the  goal  ‘to  win’. 
These  goals  are  mutually  exclusive;  if  one  wins  the 
other  must  lose.  The  situation  is  also  irreversible;  if 
Edgar wins, there is nothing Harvey can do to change 
that  (thus  the  roll  cannot  be  pushed).  Neither  has 
‘play chess’ as a skill, so both agree to use INT. Both 
players  roll  a  Regular  success.  Edgar  has  the  higher 
INT, and so wins the game.

Roll  an  additional  "tens" 
percentage  die  alongside 
the  usual  pair  of  percent-
age  dice  when  making 
a  skill  roll.  You  are  now 
rolling three  separate dice: 
one  "units"  die  and  two 
"tens"  dice.  If  you  have  a 
bonus die, you should use the "tens" die that yields the better 
(lower) result. 

Figure 1: Bonus Dice

Two rival investigators, Malcolm and Hugh, are vying 
for  the  affection  of  Lady  Greene.  Only  one  can  gain 
her hand in marriage, thus the Keeper determines that 
an opposed roll is needed to determine the outcome of 
their wooing. It is decided that each should make an 
opposed Charm roll. The Keeper reviews the events of 
the scenario so far: Malcolm has visited Lady Greene 
twice,  each  time  lavishing  expensive  gifts  upon  her, 
while Hugh has only visited once and brought no gifts 
at all. The Keeper states that Malcolm has an advan-
tage and will get a bonus die in the opposed roll.

Hugh’s player rolls first against his Charm skill of 

55, getting 45—a Regular success.

Malcolm’s  player  rolls  against  his  Charm  skill 
with  one  bonus  die,  rolling  one  units  die  and  two 
tens dice (see fig 1.) The units die reads 4 and can be 
paired with either of the two tens dice to give scores 
of  44  or  24.  Malcolm’s  player  takes  the  lower  result 
24—a Hard success.

Malcolm wins the opposed roll, and his proposal 

of marriage to Lady Greene is accepted.

Bonus Dice and Penalty Dice              
(Primaily for Use with Opposed Dice Rolls)
Sometimes  the  prevailing  conditions,  environment,  and 
available time can hinder or benefit a skill or characteristic 
roll. Certain conditions mean that the Keeper may grant a 
bonus die or a penalty die to a roll. 

Bonus dice and penalty dice are not trifling small additions 
or subtractions of a few percentage points, and so should not 
be used without good cause. If a factor is so small that it would 
only modify a roll by a few percentage points then don’t bother 
with it. Driving in light rain should not inflict a penalty die, but 
torrential rain so thick that you can barely see, even with the 
wipers on full speed—now there’s your penalty! 

For each penalty die: 

Roll  an  additional  "tens" 
percentage  die  alongside 
the usual pair of percent-
age  dice.  You  are  now 
rolling 3 separate dice: one 
"units" die and two "tens" 
dice. For a penalty, use the 
"tens"  die  that  yields  the 
worse (highest) result. 

91 

Figure 2: Penalty Dice

chapter 5: game systemDifficulty Levels vs. Bonus/Penalty Dice
In the majority of cases, only one person, usually the player, 
makes a skill roll. Any factors that provide an advantage or 
disadvantage for the investigator should be factored into the 
difficulty level set by the Keeper. Bonus dice and penalty dice 
may be awarded in conjunction with difficulty levels, at the 
Keeper’s  discretion,  but  doing  so  should  be  the  exception 
rather than the rule. 

In  the  case  of  an  opposed  roll  (wherein  both  sides  are 
rolling  in  opposition  to  one  another,  as  in  melee  combat) 
difficulty levels are never set. The level of success achieved 
by one side is, in effect, the level of difficulty that the other 
side must compete against. If there are factors that provide a 
distinct advantage or disadvantage for one of the characters 
involved, the Keeper should grant a bonus die or a penalty 
die to that player.

Skill rolls: Set level of difficulty.

Opposed rolls: Award penalty dice or bonus dice.

  An  evil  cultist  is  attempting  to  push  a  door  open 
as Harvey pushes it closed from the other side. This 
calls for a STR or SIZ roll. The Keeper lacks statistics 
for the cultist and must set an appropriate difficulty 
level. He decides that the cultist’s STR and SIZ would 
both be between 50 and 89, requiring Harvey to make 
a roll of Hard difficulty level to push the door closed. 
The Keeper allows Harvey to choose whether to use 
his  STR  or  his  SIZ  (he  uses  his  SIZ  of  course,  it  is 
much higher). If he fails, he might be able to push the 
roll  by  throwing  himself  recklessly  against  the  door, 
but only at the risk of taking physical damage should 
he fail.

If the cultist is a key non-player character (with 
STR 80 and SIZ 65), the Keeper may feel that it would 
be more fun to have both sides make an opposed roll. 
Harvey  rolls  57  against  his  SIZ  of  80,  giving  him  a 
Regular success. The Keeper rolls 15, which is an Ex-
treme success for the cultist’s STR. Harvey is knocked 
back, with no chance of pushing the roll.

Combined Skill Rolls
Some situations allow or demand the use of more than one 
skill. Only one dice roll is made, and the result then com-
pared with each of the skills named. The Keeper will specify 
whether a success is required for both skills (i.e. the roll is a 
success when measured against each of the skills) or if only 
one of the skills need be successful.

Note  the  importance  of  using  a  single  dice  roll  in  the 
latter example. Harvey has only 10% skill in both Mechan-
ical  Repair  and  Electrical  Repair.  The  chance  of  success 
when making one dice roll and comparing it to both skills

"Sorry Harrison, I don't intend to die today."

 In a dire turn of events, two investigators, Felix and 
Harrison, have been captured by the insane cultists 
of the Scarlet Smile. The cultists decide to have some 
fun at the investigators’ expense, decreeing that both 
must undertake the Ordeal of Pain, from which only 
one  can  survive;  the  loser  will  be  sacrificed  to  the 
cultists’ foul god.

The Ordeal of Pain involves lifting up a huge rock 
and  holding  it  aloft. Whoever  holds  the  rock  up  the 
longest  will  win.  This  requires  an  opposed  Strength 
roll  from  each  of  the  investigators. The  Keeper  rules 
that Harrison must take a penalty die, as he recently 
suffered a major wound (he received an injury when 
he was captured by the cultists) and is still recovering.
Felix’s player rolls 51 against STR 65—a Regular 

success.

Harrison’s  STR  is  55.  His  player  rolls  20  and 
40  on  two  tens  dice  and  1  on  the  units  die  (see  fig 
2.),  which  can  be  combined  to  read  21  or  41.  The 
extra die was a penalty die so Harrison must take the 
higher result—a Regular success.

Both  players  have  achieved  a  Regular  success, 

and so Felix wins because he has the higher STR.

Felix is able to hold the rock above his head for 
longer  than  Harrison.  The  cultists  jeer  and  lead 
Harrison off towards their altar.

Call of Cthulhuskill (whichever is higher). Thus, if the opposing skill is 50% 
or higher, a Hard success is required (a roll equal to or below 
half skill). If the opposing skill is 90% or higher, an Extreme 
success  if  required  (a  roll  equal  to  or  below  one-fifth  of 
skill). For the vast majority of non-player characters, these 
skills will be below 50%, and so the difficulty level will be 
Regular and the player only needs a regular success.

i  If  the  non-player  character  is  positively  inclined 
towards the player’s goal, don’t bother rolling dice, 
but simply have them agree. 

i  If the non-player character lacks strong feelings to-
wards the player’s goal then no modification to the 
difficulty level is required.

i  If  the  non-player  character  is  strongly  opposed  to 
the  player’s  goal,  the  difficulty  is  raised  by  one  or 
two levels.

i  If  the  player  comes  up  with  something  to  support 
their case, such as a substantive argument (if using 
Persuade), or is holding a weapon and is clearly will-
ing to use it (in the case of Intimidate), the Keeper 
should lower the difficulty by one level.

The lowest chance of success requires an Extreme success 
(equal to or below one-fifth of the skill), but in some rare 
circumstances the Keeper may rule that there is no chance 
of success and that no roll is allowed.

Brian’s  investigator  is  trying  to  intimidate  a  cultist 
into  revealing  the  name  of  the  cult’s  contact  in  the 
police force. The cultist is a doctor by profession, and 
the  Keeper  decides  that  the  doctor’s  Intimidation 
and  Psychology  skills  are  below  50%.  The  difficulty 
level therefore begins as Regular. Of course the cultist 
strongly desires not to reveal his contact, and so the 
Keeper  increases  the  difficulty  level  by  two  steps  to 
Extreme. 

Brian fails the skill roll.  Brian seeks to push the 
roll by threatening violence. He pulls out a crowbar, 
swings  it  near  the  doctor’s  head  and  then  looks  the 
doctor  straight  in  the  eye  to  make  sure  that  he  un-
derstands the implied threat. The Keeper lowers the 
difficulty  level  to  Hard.  Brian  fails  the  pushed  roll, 
and  the  Keeper  tells  how  Brian  gets  carried  away 
and, in his frustration, hits the doctor’s head with the 
crowbar, causing a nasty injury. Brian did not intend 
this—it  was  the  consequence  of  failing  the  pushed 
roll. Things don’t always go as intended! If the player 
had  succeeded  in  the  Intimidation  roll,  the  Keeper 
would be compelled to give up the name of the contact 
(as it was the player’s goal), but as the roll was failed, 
it is now entirely up to the Keeper whether the doctor 
is  forthcoming,  regardless  of  any  further  action  the 
investigators may take against him.

"I'm coming in!"

simultaneously  is  10%.  If  two  separate  rolls  were  made, 
first against Mechanical Repair and then against Electrical 
Repair, the chance of succeeding in both would be 1%.

The  Keeper  must  decide  whether  a  situation  calls  for 

sequential skill rolls or a combined skill roll.

A deranged cultist suddenly moves to draw a gun on 
Harvey.  A  successful  Spot  Hidden  roll  would  allow 
Harvey to see the cultist’s hand moving towards the 
gun, while a successful Psychology would allow him to 
anticipate the action through the cultist’s demeanor. 
The  Keeper  asks  for  a  combined  Spot  Hidden  and 
Psychology  roll  for  Harvey.  A  success  on  either  skill 
will allow Harvey to anticipate the attacker’s action, 
and perhaps give Harvey a chance to act first. 

Later, Harvey attempts to repair an electric tur-
bine. The  item  is  both  mechanical  and  electrical,  so 
the  Keeper  asks  for  a  combined  Mechanical  Repair 
and Electrical Repair roll. One roll is made and the 
result  is  compared  to  both  skills—in  this  case  both 
must be successful to achieve the task.

Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate, and  
Persuade Skills: Difficulty Levels
An  investigator  may  have  a  Charm  skill  of  75%,  but  this 
does  not  mean  that  he  or  she  can  charm  anyone  and  ev-
eryone 75% of the time. The difficulty level is based on the 
opposing factor; in this case the matching social skill (either 
Charm,  Fast  Talk,  Intimidate,  or  Persuade)  or  Psychology

Rewards of Experience: 
The Investigator  
Development Phase
When an investigator successfully uses a skill in play, the player 
should check the box beside that skill on the investigator sheet. 
This gives the investigator a chance to learn from experience. 
No tick is earned if the roll used a bonus die. In the case of an 
opposed roll, both sides may achieve a level of success, but only 
one will win, and only the winner may tick their skill.

Typically the investigator development phase occurs at 
the end of a scenario, or if playing through a campaign, at 
the conclusion of a chapter. This may be after one session of 
play or several sessions. If a story continues beyond that, the 
Keeper should look for a pause in the narrative to allow for 
an investigator development phase. 

Once an investigator development phase has been called, 
examine the investigator sheet to see which skills have been 
checked as successes. No matter how many times a skill is 
used  successfully  in  play,  only  one  check  per  skill  can  be 
made to see if the investigator improves. 

For each skill check the player rolls 1D100. 
Succeeding at something you are not good at is difficult; 
however, successfully using the skill probably means that the 
investigator  learns  from  the  experience.  Conversely,  being 
expert at something guarantees success most of the time, yet 
that high skill means the investigator is unlikely to learn fur-
ther. It gets progressively harder to add percentiles to a skill.
If  the  player  rolls  higher  than  the  current  skill  number, 
or the result is over 95, then the investigator improves in that 

skill: roll 1D10 and immediately add the result to the current 
skill points. Skills may rise above 100% by this method.

If the player rolls equal to or less than the investigator’s 
skill level, then the investigator hasn’t learned from the ex-
perience and the skill amount does not change. 

Repeat the procedure for all the skills that been checked, 
then erase all skill checks on the investigator sheet. Skills can 
be checked again during the next game session as they are 
used successfully.

Note: The Cthulhu Mythos and Credit Rating skills nev-
er receive a skill check, and no box for such a check exists 
on the investigator sheet. Not improving a skill has no other 
consequence. 

A game has finished after a couple of sessions of play, 
and Harvey has checks against several skills. Harvey’s 
player rolls against his Stealth skill of 20%. She rolls 
08, and so Harvey does not improve in this ability. She 
then rolls Library Use (55%) for a result of 68—Har-
vey’s skill has improved. 1D10 is rolled, giving a result 
of 3. Harvey’s Library Use rises to 58%.

Skills of 90% or More
When an investigator attains 90% or more ability in a skill 
during an investigator development phase, add 2D6 points 
to their current Sanity. This reward represents the discipline 
and self-esteem gained in mastering a skill.

94 

Call of CthulhuCecil  has  a  Sword  skill  of  85%.  Having  successfully 
employed  the  skill  in  play,  a  check  is  made  for  im-
provement  in  the  skill  during  the  investigator  de-
velopment phase. Cecil’s player rolls 97, and so rolls 
1D10, adding 8 points to the skill. Cecil is now a true 
expert swordsman and gains 2D6 Sanity points. 

Other Activities During the  
Investigator Development Phase
During the investigator development phase, the player also 
has the opportunity to:

T  Gain Sanity points through their investigator spend-
ing  time  with  an  aspect  from  their  own  backstory 
(see Self-help, page 167).

T  Check their Credit Rating and review their finances 
(see  Investigator  Development  Phase:  Employ-
ment and Credit Rating, page 96).

T  Reduce all sanity limits by one (see Getting used to 

the Awfulness, page 169).

Altering an Investigator’s Backstory
A player is free to alter or add background entries on their 
investigator sheet as and when they please, subject to certain 
limitations. The player may not erase or alter entries listed 
under Injuries and Scars, Phobias and Manias, Encounters 
with Strange Entities, or anything that has been amended or 
added by the Keeper without the Keeper’s permission.

Phobias and manias may only be erased through the use 

of treatment (see Psychotherapy, page 167).

The  investigator’s  key  connection  (see  page  45)  may  be 
altered only during the investigator development phase, and 
only by the player. Guidance on using, losing, and replacing a 
key connection can be found under Self-help (see page 167).

Credit Rating and  
Investigator Expenditure
Attempting to track personal finances in a manner similar 
to  real  life  within  the  game  would  introduce  unnecessary 
complexity.  However,  using  a  slightly  abstracted  method, 
a  gauge  of  an  investigator’s  living  standard  and  spending 
power becomes possible.

An  investigator’s  starting  Credit  Rating  (CR)  is  deter-
mined  during  character  creation,  based  upon  the  investi-
gator’s  chosen  profession  (see  Sample  Occupations  pages 
40-41). 

Day-to-Day Expenses and General 
Living Standards
There is no requirement to make any account of accommoda-
tion, food, or incidental travel expenses, so long as an investi-
gator’s expenditure falls within the bounds of his or her living 
standard (see Credit Rating, page 61). In addition, a character 
can spend up to his or her Spending Level on any given day.

It is likely that money will only occasionally become an 
issue in play, when large amounts are being spent. This may 
include  preparing  for  a  major  trip,  purchasing  expensive 
items such as a vehicle or rare book, or hiring extra staff.

The combination of being allowed to spend freely within 
the bounds of their living standard and the freedom of not 
being required to record expenditure below a certain spend-
ing level is intended to minimize bookkeeping. The use of 
this system may to lead to areas of uncertainty as to exactly 
what is within the bounds of an individual’s living standard 
and  whether  an  investigator  has  exceeded  their  spending 
level. As always, the Keeper is the arbiter of such matters and 
is advised to intervene only when an investigator has clearly 
exceeded their spending level.  

Harvey begins the game with a Credit Rating of 41 
(Average).  This  affords  him  an  average  living  stan-
dard;  he  may  stay  in  moderately  priced  hotels,  eat 
out  (economically)  and  take  the  occasional  taxi.  In 
addition, he may spend up to $10 per day. None of 
this requires any bookkeeping on the player’s part.

Harvey spends a couple of sessions of play carrying 
out investigations in Boston, travelling around by bus 
and taxi, visiting libraries, interviewing people, and 
all  the  usual  things  a  Call  of  Cthulhu  investigator 
might get up to. This is all within his living standard 
and spending limit. No bookkeeping is required.

Spending Beyond One’s Spending 
Limit
When  an  investigator  spends  an  amount  beyond  their 
spending limit, the player must reduce their cash by the full 
amount  spent.  If  cash  is  insufficient,  the  investigator  may 
seek to use their assets. Converting assets into cash can take 
time; how long is up to the Keeper. Mortgaging a property, 
selling antiques, gaining loans, and so on all take time. If the 
investigator  is  away  from  their  hometown,  this  is  likely  to 
take even longer.

If  multiple  purchases  of  less  than  the  investigator’s 
spending threshold are made on the same day, the Keeper 
may insist on combining the total purchases for comparison 
with  the  investigator’s  spending  level,  and  demand  that  a 
cash spend is deducted if the spending limit is exceeded.

chapter 5: game systemHarvey wants to buy a 12-gauge shotgun, costing $40. 
This  being  above  his  $10  spending  limit,  he  reduces 
his cash by $40 (from $82 to $42).

Later,  Harvey  wishes  to  take  a  trip  to  England, 
choosing to travel by sea, first class, costing $120.  This 
is beyond Harvey’s available cash. Harvey has $1665 
tied  up  in  assets,  and  seeks  to  realize  some  of  that 
capital by getting a loan from the bank. The Keeper 
agrees to this and decides that it might take a week to 
get the money. Harvey transfers $245 from his assets 
to his cash. From the $245, he spends $120 on the tick-
et, leaving $125, which he adds to his remaining cash 
of  $42.  His  cash  is  now  $167,  and  his  assets  $1400. 
When  he  gets  to  England,  his  finances  will  function 
just as they did back home (average living standards 
and a $10 per day spending limit).

Spending 
Money in Call 
of Cthulhu
If your characters travel 
to a place with a lower 
cost of living then they 
should find their money 
buys more. For example, if 
Harvey journeyed to rural 
India, he would find he 
was relatively rich and that 
he was able to afford a 
living standard above his 
usual one.

Harvey has a spending limit of $10 per day. One day 
he makes numerous spends; a camera, a short inter-
national telegram, and taking a contact out to dinner 
at a plush restaurant. He then wishes to attend a show 
at the music hall. At this point the Keeper decides that 
Harvey  has  spent  $15  (exceeding  his  $10  spending 
limit). Harvey reduces his cash by $15.

Money Coming In
During the game a character may receive a large sum of mon-
ey, perhaps as a reward. Such a sum can be added to cash in 
the short term or be invested in time as part of their assets. 

Harvey has gone on a shopping spree.

Going into Debt

How  debt  is  taken  on  and  repaid  is  all  part  of  your  story. 
Perhaps the investigator’s car must be sold, or money must 
be  sought  from  a  loan  shark. While  financial  transactions 
are not intended to be the focus of play, the steady decline of 
a character’s Sanity may well go hand-in-hand with physical 
and material decline.

Investigator Development Phase: 
Employment and Credit Rating
Ill-health  (physical  or  mental)  or  continued  absence  from 
work may lead to loss of employment and a fall in income. 
Some professions do not require the investigator to be ac-
tively  employed  to  derive  an  income  (such  as  Dilettante), 
and  so  are  not  prone  to  loss  of  employment.  However  a 
stock market crash will have a major effect on such an in-
dividual’s  finances,  and  events  should  be  dealt  with  at  the 
Keeper’s discretion (perhaps using Luck rolls). Conversely, 
Credit Rating might be raised when an investigator acquires 
a higher-paying job.

A person can be rich one day and on the street the next, 
but  a  gradual  decline  is  more  common.  If  an  investigator 
loses  their  employment,  they  lose  their  income,  and  their 
Credit Rating will fall. A loss of assets does not necessarily 
indicate  a  loss  of  Credit  Rating  if  one  still  has  a  reliable 
income.

Where  an  investigator’s  financial  situation  has  under-
gone a significant change, the Keeper should decide on one 
of  the  following  options.  The  following  list  of  conditions 
ranges from good to bad, and should generally be applied 
during the investigator development phase.

96 

Call of CthulhuI’m  rich!  When  an  investigator  comes  into  money,  they 
should  check  to  see  if  their  assets  are  equal  to  those  of  a 
higher living standard bracket. If this is the case, the player 
should increase their investigator’s Credit Rating in steps of 
1D10 until their Credit Rating is within the new bracket. 

the Credit Rating and Asset Value of each investigator in a way 
that feels appropriate to events in the story. Continuing with 
the status quo is of course the default,  and Keepers should only 
seek to make changes when they are waranted.

If  Harvey  (starting  in  the ‘average  income’  bracket) 
came  into  money  such  that  his  assets  increased  to 
$30,000,  this  would  bring  him  within  the  ‘wealthy’ 
bracket for the 1920s ($25,000–$44,500). His Credit 
Rating was previously 41 (average). His player rolls a 
1D10—resulting in a 4—and 4 is added to Harvey’s 
Credit Rating, raising it to 45. Another two rolls are 
made,  a  3  raises  his  Credit  Rating  to  48,  then  a  9 
raises it to 57. Credit Rating 57 is within the ‘wealthy’ 
income bracket, so no more rolls are added.

Things are looking up: if the investigator has been promot-
ed,  their  Credit  Rating  should  rise  accordingly  (add  1D6 
Credit Rating).

Life goes on as usual: if nothing much has changed to affect 
the investigator’s income, their Credit Rating will not alter.

Tightening one’s belt: the investigator is demoted or takes 
a period of unpaid leave. Decrease Credit Rating by 1D10.

Sold  the  family  silver:  the  investigator  has  spent  the  vast 
majority of their assets. If the investigator’s total worth (cash 
plus  assets)  now  equals  the  asset  value  of  a  lower  income 
level, decrease Credit Rating by 1D10.

Bad  luck  and  troubles:  the  investigator  loses  their  main 
source of income, usually their job. Decrease Credit Rating 
by  2D10  with  each  following  investigator  development 
phase.  If  there  is  a  state  safety  net,  the  minimum  Credit 
Rating will be 1D10-1. 

Crash! The sudden loss of all income and/or all debts being 
called in (such as in a stock market crash) lead to a dramatic 
decline  in  the  character's  fortunes.  The  investigator  must 
reduce his or her Credit Rating by 1D100. If an investigator’s 
Credit  Rating  withstands  the  loss,  it  indicates  that  either 
investigator is offered another job immediately or that they 
secreted money away somewhere safe (note the lowest Cred-
it Rating is zero—negative numbers are ignored). 

During  the  investigator  development  phase,  following 
the review of Credit Rating, the investigator’s cash should be 
refreshed, adding the amount of cash indicated on the chart for 
their present Credit Rating to any remaining cash they possess. 
Assets can change in one of two ways. First, the investigator’s 
Credit Rating can rise or fall (as a result of a change in employ-
ment, for example), in which case their asset value should be 
recalculated to fit the revised Credit Rating score. Second, an 
investigator can spend or accrue a large sum of money that will 
affect their asset value and, if sufficient, also alter their Credit 
Rating score. The Keeper should use the advice above to change 

At the end of the adventure in England, Harvey returns 
to Boston. His finances have been depleted by the trip 
but he has a great story to publish. Harvey has $80 cash 
and only $50 in assets remaining. The Keeper  agrees 
that Harvey still has his job and, while he had to sell 
his  house  and  move  into  rented  accommodation,  he 
may remain in the Average income bracket. The Keeper 
feels this best fits ‘Sold the family silver’ (his combined 
wealth is now a little more than that of ‘Poor’), and so 
insists on a decrease in Credit Rating of 1D10. Harvey’s 
player rolls 07, so Harvey’s Credit Rating drops from 
41  to  34.  Referring  to  the  Cash  and  Assets  chart,  a 
Credit Rating of 34 gets $68 cash, so this is added to 
his remaining money, giving Harvey a total of $148 in 
cash. Harvey’s assets remain at $50.

Contacts
During  the  game,  investigators  may  wish  to  make  use  of 
their  personal  and  professional  contacts.  The  Keeper  can 
either simply allow for the existence of a contact or ask for 
a dice roll. Players can make rolls to establish contacts for 
their  investigators  using  whichever  skill  or  characteristic 
seems  most  appropriate:  Chemistry  to  know  a  chemist, 
Medicine to know a surgeon, and so on. 

A successful roll when establishing a contact means that 
either the non-player character has heard of the investigator 
(by reputation) or that the investigator has previously met 
the contact. Apply modifiers to the roll as appropriate. Lo-
cation is a big factor—being far from home or in a sparsely 
populated  area  would  increase  the  difficulty  level.  If  the 
investigator  is  on  his  or  her  home  ground  and  trying  to 
contact someone of the same profession, the Keeper should 
lower the difficulty level. 

Establishing a contact does not automatically mean that 
the contact will do as the investigator wishes; some persua-
sion, fast talk, charm, or intimidation may be required, and 
should be roleplayed. 

If the player wishes to push the roll to establish a contact, 
the Keeper should make the pushed roll out of the player’s 
sight (a concealed dice roll), so the player does not know the 
outcome.  A  suggested  consequence  for  failing  the  pushed 
roll is to allow the investigator to unwittingly meet an an-
tagonistic or unreliable contact. Such a contact may appear 
helpful to the investigator, but will double-cross or deceive 
the investigator in some manner. A concealed roll is used in 
this  instance,  since  knowledge  of  the  outcome  of  the  dice 
roll would inform the player as to the contact’s disposition.

97 

chapter 5: game systemHarvey  has  traveled  to  London  and  wants  to  go 
through  the  archives  of  The  Times  for  unpublished 
evidence linked to his investigation. He is refused ac-
cess to The Times’ archives, and so seeks to establish 
a contact among the local press who might be able to 
vouch for him and gain him access. There is no jour-
nalism skill, so the Keeper suggests either Photography 
(Harvey  may  know  a  fellow  photographer)  or  Own 
Language  (as  the  skill  most  associated  with  being  a 
journalist).  The  Keeper  raises  the  difficultly  level  to 
Hard, as Harvey is a long way from home. Harvey has 
Own Language 84% and half of this or less must be 
rolled to establish a contact. Harvey fails the roll, and 
can find no contacts. He persists with trawling every 
minor  publication,  and  the  Keeper  grants  a  pushed 
roll, rolling the dice out of the player’s view (concealed 
roll). The roll is failed again and the Keeper informs 
the  player  that  Harvey  contacts  Martyn  Lace,  pub-
lisher of The Camden Enquirer, who claims to know 
of  Harvey’s  reputation  as  a  photographer.  Lace  is 
curious about Harvey, and will appear helpful while 
trying to find out about Harvey’s investigation for his 
own gain. Perhaps he will warn Harvey’s enemies (for 
a reward) or publish the story himself, thus exposing 
Harvey’s careful work.

Training
Given  enough  money,  someone  will  teach  anything.  The 
existence of training makes game sense only in campaigns, 
where the same investigators meet regularly to engage in an 
ongoing mystery.

One should not go to school and learn more than 1D10 
points in a skill per four months of game time without good 
reason. The Keeper decides if multiple courses can be taken 
and how to judge if the investigator’s class participation is 
satisfactory. An experience check comes automatically upon 
successfully completing a segment of training; however too 
many  adventures  in  a  semester  will  invalidate  classroom 
work or practice for that term.

At  the  Keeper’s  option,  the  learning  rate  for  a  skill 
might be increased or the learning interval shortened if the 
investigator  has  access  to  a  renowned  teacher.  Such  access 
should come as a reward for an outstanding deed, or after 
great perseverance, since many compete for the favor of the 
famous.

Player  and  Keeper  may  arrange  self-study  of  any  aca-
demic subject. The investigator must study for four months, 
after  which  the  player  rolls  as  if  for  a  skill  check  (tick)  in 
that skill (attempting to roll above their current skill level on 
1D100 and gaining 1D10 skill points if successful).

Combat  skill  specialisms,  such  as  Sword,  are  so  little 
used that schools and personal trainers represent the only 
way to learn.

Aging
There  are  various  modifiers  applied  during  investigator 
creation to reflect the investigator’s age. In the rare instances 
that  an  investigator  ages  significantly  in  play,  modifiers 
should be applied to reflect the change in age. This is unlike-
ly to be a factor in many games, but may come in to play in a 
campaign, or when jumping decades and picking up an in-
vestigator’s story later in life. Aging may also occur suddenly 
as a result of a spell or magical gate; such aging may inflict 
the negative physical effects without the gain in education.
The  aging  effects  are  cumulative,  so  if  ageing  two  de-
cades  from  thirties  to  fifties,  apply  modifiers  for  turning 
both forty and fifty.

Turning 20: Make an improvement check for EDU. Add 5 
points among STR and SIZ.

Turning 40: Make an improvement check for EDU. Deduct 
5 points among STR, CON or DEX, and reduce APP by 5. 
Reduce MOV by 1.

Turning 50: Make an improvement check for EDU. Deduct 
5 points among STR, CON or DEX, and reduce APP by 5. 
Reduce MOV by 1.

Turning 60: Make an improvement check for EDU. Deduct 
10 points among STR, CON or DEX, and reduce APP by 5. 
Reduce MOV by 1.

Turning 70: Deduct 20 points among STR, CON or DEX, 
and reduce APP by 5. Reduce MOV by 1.

Turning 80: Deduct 40 points among STR, CON or DEX, 
and reduce APP by 5. Reduce MOV by 1.

Each  decade  thereafter:  Deduct  80  points  among  STR, 
CON or DEX. Reduce MOV by 1.

Harvey  plays  a  few  1920s  stories,  after  which  the 
Keeper wishes to play a scenario set in the 1930s. This 
finds Harvey 10 years older (now aged 52) and so the 
aging effects are applied. A dice roll of 98 grants Harvey 
1D10 improvement to his EDU, adding 9 points for an 
EDU  of  93.  The  player  then  reduces  Harvey’s  CON 
and APP by 5 points each. Harvey is still a handsome 
fellow (APP 75). His hit points are decreased by 1 to 14 
as a result of his drop in Constitution. His MOV drops 
from 6 to 5, he’s not as fast as he used to be, but all in 
all, Harvey is aging pretty well!

Call of CthulhuOptional Rules

Spending Luck
After the player has made a skill roll (using a skill or charac-
teristic),  Luck  points  may  be  spent  to  alter  the  result.  The 
player can use Luck points to alter a roll on a 1-for-1 basis. 
The  points  spent  are  deducted  from  the  investigator’s  Luck 
score, which will reduce the chance of passing a future Luck 
roll. 

Luck points may not be spent on Luck rolls, damage rolls, 
Sanity rolls, or rolls to determine the amount of Sanity points 
lost. A player may spend any amount of Luck points (up to 
their current Luck value) on a roll. A player may only spend 
Luck to alter one of their own dice rolls.

When  a  skill  roll  is  failed,  the  player  has  the  option  to 
push the roll OR spend luck; Luck points may not be spent to 
alter the result of a pushed roll.

Criticals, fumbles, and firearm malfunctions always apply, 

and cannot be bought off with Luck points. 

Also, no skill improvement check is earned if Luck points 

were used to alter the dice roll.

In play, an investigator’s Luck will fall through spends and 

rise through recovery (see below).

Recovering Luck points
After each session of play, each player may make an improve-
ment check for their Luck. This is rolled in the same way as 
for skill improvement. The player rolls 1D100 and if the roll is 
above their present Luck score they add 1D10 points to their 
Luck score. If the roll is equal to or less than the investigator’s 
present Luck score, no points are recovered.

Note: An investigator’s Luck score will vary throughout 
play, but may not exceed 99. The Luck starting value is not 
used again in the game. There are no resets and the starting 
value can be exceeded in play.

The Keeper rolls an Extreme success for a Dark Young 
to  trample  Harvey  into  the  dust.  Harvey  fails  to 
dodge with a roll of 73, far above his Dodge skill of 27. 
This  is  life  or  death,  and  so  Harvey’s  player  spends 
46 of Harvey’s Luck points to convert the Dodge roll 
to  an  Extreme  success.  Harvey  avoids  death  by  a 
hairsbreadth!

At the start of the following session (Harvey hav-
ing somehow survived to fight another day), Harvey’s 
player makes a check for Luck recovery. Harvey’s Luck 
is now down to 8 points. The player rolls 37 and so 
adds 1D10 to Harvey’s Luck, increasing it to 14. Let’s 
hope Harvey doesn’t have to rely on his luck today.

99 

chapter 5: game systemespite  their  best  efforts  to  avoid  bloodshed, 
sometimes  investigators  are  faced  with  situa-
tions where the outcome can only be decided 
by the fist or gun.
Combat  encompasses  a  range  of  skills  and 
goals; sometimes an investigator may wish to merely subdue 
an  opponent  without  causing  undue  harm,  while  at  other 
times the goal may be to kill, or simply to flee.

Combat has its own rules that focus on the action and 
help to determine who is doing what, when it is done, and 
the degree of success achieved. Rather than having a single 
roll decide the outcome of the fight, a series of rolls are made 
until there is a clear victor.

Declaration of Intent: “What 
is your character doing?”

The Keeper should always ask the player that question and 
encourage  them  to  describe  their  investigator’s  actions 
rather than use game terminology. “I’m rolling to hit,” is not 
something an investigator would ever say or do. Endeavor 
to  paint  a  picture  with  your  descriptions  of  combat  and 
encourage your players to do likewise. When the player has 
described their investigator’s action, the Keeper should then 
tell the player which skill to roll dice against. 

Player: “I’m going to punch the guard, then run for the open door.”
Keeper: “The  guard  is  going  to  try  to  grab  you.  Roll  your 
Brawling skill.”

Keeper: “The  monstrous  humanoid  is  running  straight  at 
you—what are you doing?”
Player: “I raise my shotgun and blast the thing.”
Keeper: “OK, give me a skill roll for Shotgun.”

Keeper: “Scott’s  investigator  is  acting  crazy—he’s  heading 
out  of  the  tent  into  the  freezing  cold  without  his  coat  or 
mittens. He’ll freeze to death out there!”
Player: “I’m going to grab him and wrestle him to the ground.”
Keeper: “Let’s have an opposed Brawling roll.”

Notice  how  the  request  for  a  dice  roll  develops  out  of 
what the players say. In the first example the goal is to get 
past the guard, and the punch is simply a method of achiev-
ing the goal; damage may be inflicted as a consequence, but 
the Keeper uses the dice to judge whether the maneuver is 
accomplished.

In the second example, the player’s goal is clearly to inflict 
maximum damage, so the dice will be used to determine if the 
monster is hit, and to gauge the amount of damage inflicted.
In  the  third  example  the  player  is  trying  to  restrain  a 
fellow investigator without inflicting harm. Again the dice 
will be used to gauge the success of the maneuver. 

The  dice  are  then  rolled,  usually  by  the  Keeper  and  the 
player simultaneously, and the results used to determine what 
maneuvers are achieved and how much damage is inflicted.

How  you  describe  the  outcome  of  the  dice  roll  is  im-
portant  to  your  story,  but  of  no  importance  to  the  game 
mechanics. One Fighting roll which inflicts 6 hit points of 

damage  may  represent  a  few  good  punches,  a  knee  to  the 
groin, a series of kicks or a head-butt—your description of 
the outcome should elaborate upon your stated intention, 
suiting the relative success achieved.

Try to use this format each round: allow each character’s 
actions in the story to suggest what rolls are required, resolve 
the dice rolls, incorporate the outcome of the rolls back into 
the  story,  then  move  onto  the  next  character.  Don’t  just 
repeatedly roll dice without any story. 

The Combat Round
It is confusing for everyone when multiple players act and 
speak  at  once,  so  to  maintain  order,  combat  is  structured 
into rounds, with each player taking one turn in each round. 
A  combat  round  is  a  deliberately  elastic  unit  of  time  in 
which everyone wishing to act and capable of doing so has 
a  chance  to  complete  at  least  one  action.  An  investigator’s 
equality  of  opportunity  is  much  more  important  than  the 
notion that a combat round must represent a precise amount 
of real-world time. When every investigator and other Keep-
er-controlled characters have had an opportunity to act, that 
combat round is over and the next round can begin. 

Dexterity and the Order of Attack 
The  question  of  who  gets  the  first  opportunity  to  attack 
can be an important issue in a fight. Determine the order 
of attack by ranking the combatants' DEX from highest to 
lowest. In the case of a draw, the side with the higher combat 
skill goes first.

Actions in a Combat Round
On  their  turn  in  the  DEX  order  (highest  to  lowest)  each 
character may use their action:

T  To initiate an attack using the Fighting or Firearms 

skill*.

T  To perform a fighting maneuver.
T  To flee from the combat.
T  To cast a spell.
T  To  perform  some  other  action  requiring  time  and 
perhaps  a  dice  roll,  such  as  picking  a  lock  while 
others fight.

*Note that some monsters are capable  of multiple attacks in 
one round: these all take place on the monster’s turn.

A  character  may  elect  to  delay  acting  until  another 
character has acted. If this leads to more than one character 
wishing to act simultaneously, the one with the highest DEX 
takes  priority.  If  both  insist  on  waiting  for  the  other,  the 
round may end with neither of them acting and therefore 
losing their action, after which play will continue with the 
usual order of combat next round.

Call of CthulhuFist Fights
The man behind me—he only one of the party older than 
I—croaked the hackneyed “My God!” in the most cracked 
voice I ever heard. Of seven cultivated men, only Sir William 
Brinton retained his composure, a thing the more to his credit 
because he led the party and must have seen the sight first.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Rats In The Walls

To  explain  the  combat  rules,  we  shall  start  with  a  simple, 
old-fashioned, one-on-one fist fight. Later we can add rules 
for melee weapons, multiple opponents, firearms, and other 
options.

This  fight  might  be  a  barroom  brawl,  or  any  situation 
where  two  people  are  determined  to  hurt  one  another  in 
unarmed combat. This is not a boxing match or a martial 
arts class; there are no holds barred here. This is down and 
dirty: fists fly, feet lash out, hair is pulled, foreheads clash, 
nails rake, fingers twist, vulnerable parts are targeted, eyes 
gouged, and teeth spat out. This is all encompassed in one 
skill:  Brawling  (a  specialization  of  the  Fighting  skill).  The 
alternative to attacking is to try to avoid being hit, and this is 
represented by the Dodge skill. 

Melee  attacks  are  resolved  using  opposed  skill  rolls. 
When attacked, a character has a simple choice: either dodge 
or fight back. 

T  If the character chooses to fight back, use the target’s 
Fighting skill to oppose the attacker’s Fighting skill. 
T  If  the  character  chooses  to  dodge,  use  the  target’s 
Dodge skill to oppose the attacker’s Fighting skill.
T  If  the  target  is  neither  fighting  back  nor  dodging, 

refer to surprise attacks on page 106.

Resolving a Fighting Attack Made 
Against a Target That is Fighting Back
Both sides roll percentile dice and compare the results with 
their  own  Fighting  skill.  The  side  with  the  better  level  of 
success avoids being harmed, and inflicts damage on their 
opponent (see Determining Damage, nearby). If both sides 
achieve  the  same  level  of  success,  the  character  initiating 
the attack hits the character that is fighting back, inflicting 
damage. 

T  If the attacker achieves a higher level of success, they 

deal damage to their target.

T  If the defender achieves a higher level of success, he 
or she has successfully blocked, parried or avoided 
the  attacker’s  blows  and  simultaneously  landed  a 
blow  of  their  own  upon  their  attacker,  inflicting 
damage.

T  In the case of a draw, the attacker wins (when their 

opponent is fighting back).
T  If both fail, no damage is inflicted.

Harvey  has  been  cornered  by  an  angry  cultist,  and 
both are attempting to hurt one another. The cultist 
has  a  DEX  of  55  and  so  does  Harvey.  However  the 
cultist’s Fighting (Brawling) skill is 70%, which is far 
higher than Harvey’s, so the cultist acts first.

Resolving a Fighting Attack Made 
Against a Target That is Dodging
The attacker and the target (who is trying to dodge) make 
an  opposed  roll  using  their  Fighting  skill  and  Dodge  skill 
respectively.  If  the  attacker  gains  a  higher  level  of  success, 
the attack is successful and the attacker inflicts damage on 
the  loser  (see  Determining  Damage,  below).  Otherwise 
the attack is dodged and no damage is dealt. If both sides 
achieve the same level of success, the character dodging wins 
and evades the attack.

T  If the attacker achieves a higher level of success, they 

deal damage.

T  If  the  defender  achieves  a  higher  level  of  success, 
they have dodged the attack and take no damage.
T  In the case of a draw, the defender wins (when the 

defender is dodging).

T  If both fail, no damage is inflicted.

Determining Damage
The amount of damage that an attack delivers is indicated 
on  Table  XVII:  Weapons  (pages  401-405).  Note  that  the 
damage for unarmed human attacks is 1D3 (e.g. punching 
and kicking).

Extreme Damage and Impales

Greater damage is inflicted if the attacker gains an Extreme 
level of success in their attack. This only occurs if the attack 
is made on a character’s turn in the DEX order, not when 
fighting back: each character gets one moment in the spot-
light each round, and this is their opportunity to make an 
outstanding attack. 

If  the  attacker  achieves  an  Extreme  success  with  a 
non-impaling  weapon  (for  example,  blunt  weapons,  such 
as a fist, kick, or club), then they have hit a weak spot and 
caused maximum damage (plus maximum damage bonus, 
if any).

If the attacker achieves an Extreme level of success with 
a  penetrating  weapon  (such  as  a  blade  or  bullet)  then  an 
impale  has  been  inflicted.  This  means  that  the  weapon  or 
bullet chanced to strike a vital area, driving deeply through 
arteries  or  slashing  crucial  tendons  or  muscles.  Apply  the 
increased  damage  as  for  an  Extreme  success  with  a  blunt 
weapon (maximum damage plus maximum damage bonus) 
and add a damage roll for the weapon.

103 

chapter 6: combatA  character  with  1D4  damage  bonus  achieves  an 
Extreme  level  of  success  when  attacking  with  a 
switchblade.  The  player  rolls  1D4  for  the  weapon’s 
damage, and adds the maximum damage the weapon 
can inflict (4) together with their maximum damage 
bonus (4). This results in a total of 1D4+8, (a range of 
9 to 12 points of damage).

Weapons  that  can  impale  are  indicated  on  the  Table 

XVII: Weapons (pages 401-405).

Using Weapons in a Fight
Anything that can be picked up and used to hit or stab can be 
considered a melee weapon. If it is the kind of weapon that 
anyone could just pick up and use (a chair leg, kitchen knife, 
etc.), then use the Fighting (Brawl) skill. Such weapons be-
long to the basic weapons category and include simple clubs 
and knives. If the weapon is more cumbersome or complex 
and  does  not  conform  to  the  basic  weapons  category,  a 
weapon  specialization  skill  should  be  used. Weapons  with 
similar  characteristics  and  function  are  grouped  together 
for the purpose of weapon skill specializations. 

Consult Table XVII: Weapons (pages 401-405) for de-
tails  of  the  weapon  groups  and  specific  weapons,  together 
with the damage they inflict.

Old  Man  Birch  has  the  choice  of  picking  up  a  knife 
or a sword. With the knife, he would use his Fighting 
(Brawl) skill of 40%. A sword is trickier to use and has 
its own skill, which is not part of the Fighting (Brawl) 
skill.  Old  Man  Birch  doesn’t  have  any  skill  with  a 
sword, so would have to use it at the base skill value: 
Fighting (Sword) 20%.

Improvised Weapons
All  sorts  of  items  can  be  used  to  inflict  physical  harm: 
snooker cues, scissors, bottles, rocks and so on. Even a gram-
ophone player could be smashed over the back of someone’s 
head for a nasty injury. 

The  Keeper  should  determine  the  damage  done  by  an 
improvised  weapon  by  using  a  comparable  item  on  Table 
XVII: Weapons (pages 401-405). If the improvised weapon 
is similar to a basic melee weapon, such as a knife or club, it 
may be used with the Fighting (Brawl) skill. If it is not, the 
Keeper should decide on which Fighting skill specialization 
is appropriate.

Everyone  is  strongly  encouraged  to  make  use  of  the 
environment in a fight. Doing so will add a unique feel to 
each  fight  and  will  make  the  setting  come  to  life.  If  every 
fight uses the same old punches, kicks, and regular weapons, 
they  may  feel  repetitive.  Picture  the  scene  and  grab  what 
comes to mind. If the fight takes place in a bar, you should 

No Pushing 
Combat Rolls
There is no option to 
push combat rolls (either 
Fighting or Firearms). Skill 
rolls are resolved with one 
or two rolls, but combat 
is resolved with a sequence 
of rolls. Pushing a skill 
roll indicates a subsequent 
attempt—a concerted 
effort to succeed. In 
combat this subsequent 
attempt would be your 
next punch or your next 
shot, i.e. your next attack.

Does the Monster 
Fight Back or 
Dodge?
The default mode for monsters 
and non-player character is to 
fight back rather than dodge. This 
serves to make combat quicker and 
simpler for the Keeper. Monsters 
and non-player characters should 
only use dodge when their priority 
is to escape.

Frying pans make excellent improvised weapons.

be  swinging  pool  cues,  throwing  bottles,  and  hitting  each 
other with barstools. Fire pokers, hat stands, and ornamen-
tal swords may be to hand in a mansion. Computer mon-
itors,  power  cables,  and  scissors  could  all  be  deadly  in  an 
office. As Keeper, encourage your players to improvise and 

104 

Call of Cthulhudon’t block their ideas without good reason. If you want to 
introduce the hand of fate to determine whether that handy 
improvised weapon is present, call for a Luck roll.

Fighting Maneuvers
If a player describes a goal other than simply inflicting phys-
ical  harm,  such  as  disarming  their  opponent  or  knocking 
them  over,  then  it  can  be  resolved  with  a  maneuver.  This 
may include pushing someone out of the way, throwing the 
opponent  to  the  floor,  restraining  someone  in  a  headlock, 
disarming an opponent, and so on.

Step 1: Compare Builds
Clearly skill is an important factor in performing a success-
ful  fighting  maneuver,  but  size  and  strength  also  have  an 
effect.  A  small,  skillful  fighter  might  unbalance  or  disarm 
a  larger  opponent,  but  there  are  limits.  No  human  is  ever 
going to be able to wrestle a huge monster such as a Dark 
Young  of  Shub-Niggurarth  to  the  ground,  whatever  their 
skill.  Conveniently,  Size  and  Strength  are  already  factored 
into each character’s Build, and thus by comparing these we 
may gauge the relative might of the opponents. 

Old Man Birch has a good left hook.

Harvey: DEX 55

Fighting (Brawl) skill: 25 (Regular) / 12 (Hard) / 5 (Extreme)
Dodge skill: 27 (Regular) / 13 (Hard) / 5 (Extreme)

Old Man Birch: DEX 60     

Fighting (Brawl) skill: 40 (Regular) / 20 (Hard) / 8 (Extreme)
Dodge skill: 30 (Regular) / 15 (Hard) / 6 (Extreme)

The first round:

Things go badly for Harvey when he fails to sneak around the house, leading to an encounter with Old Man Birch, 

who tries to punch the intruder.

Old Man Birch has the higher DEX and therefore goes first. 

Old Man Birch’s Action:

The Keeper picks up the dice and states that Old Man Birch is swinging a fist at Harvey. Harvey’s reaction is to duck. 
The Keeper will therefore roll against Old Man Birch’s Fighting (Brawl) skill and will be opposed by Harvey’s Dodge skill.

The Keeper rolls 04 for Old Man Birch’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—an Extreme success.
Harvey requires an Extreme level of success to avoid the blow. Harvey’s player rolls 25 for Harvey’s Dodge skill—a 

Regular success. Not good enough.

Old Man Birch deals 1D3 damage for an unarmed attack, to which is added his 1D4 damage bonus. As it was an 
Extreme success, the maximum result is used in place of rolling dice; Harvey takes the full 7 points of damage (3 + 4 = 7).
The Keeper tells how Old Man Birch catches Harvey with a left hook before he has a chance to flee. This is followed 
up with a couple of solid jabs as Harvey reels back, blood running down his face. A smile spreads over Old Man Birch’s 
face as he gets a taste of victory.
Harvey’s action:

Harvey  is  cornered  and  lashes  out  at  his  foe.  Old  Man  Birch  attempts  to  side-step  and  clout  Harvey  again.  His 

intentions include damage, so this means he is fighting back.

Harvey’s player rolls 25 for Harvey’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Regular success. 
The Keeper rolls 23 for Old Man Birch’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Regular success.
When the target is fighting back, the attacker wins in the case of a tie. Harvey rolls 1D3 for 2 points of damage.
That’s the end of round one.

105 

chapter 6: combat 
 
 
 
To determine the relative capability of the two opponents 
and whether the character performing the maneuver takes 
penalty dice, simply compare the Build of the two combat-
ants. If the character performing the maneuver has a smaller 
Build than their opponent then he or she takes a penalty die 
for each point of difference (to a maximum of two penalty 
dice). If an opponent exceeds the attacker’s build by three 
or more, any fighting maneuvers are ineffective; the attacker 
may be able to lay hands on their opponent, but lacks the 
strength and size required to take advantage of their grip.

T  If  the  character  performing  the  maneuver  has  a 
Build that is three or more points lower than their 
opponent’s, the maneuver is impossible.

T  If  the  character  performing  the  maneuver  has  a 
Build that is two points lower than their opponent’s, 
the maneuver roll is made with two penalty dice.
T  If  the  character  performing  the  maneuver  has  a 
Build that is one point lower than their opponent’s, 
the maneuver roll is made with one penalty die.
T  If  the  character  performing  the  maneuver  has  the 
same (or higher) Build as their opponent, no addi-
tional modifiers are applied.

Step 2: Make the Attack Roll
A  maneuver  is  treated  the  same  way  as  a  regular  Fighting 
attack. Most maneuvers will use the Brawling skill, though 
some  may  be  performed  using  another  specialization:  for 
example, the Fighting (Sword) skill might be used to disarm 
a person. The Keeper must rule according to the situation. 
The opponent should choose to either dodge or fight back as 
they would when attacked normally. 

Fighting Maneuvers   
Require a Definite Goal
Sometimes a player may state an action as 
a goal; in response to having a gun pointed 
in their face they might simply say, “I’m 
pushing  his  arm  away  so  the  gun  isn’t 
pointing at my face”. Pushing an arm away 
isn’t  a  goal—it’s  an  action.  It  doesn’t 
define  a  strong  objective;  the  opponent 
could  simply  say  they  are  pulling  back 
and firing the gun when it comes to their 
turn. A goal should be something definite 
such as, “I’m knocking the gun from his 
hand”, “I’m seizing the pistol from him”, 
or “I’m grabbing the gun arm and keeping it 
pointed away from me”. Each of these has 
a  definite  effect  on  the  status  quo  and 
thus constitutes a goal.

Maneuver attack roll:
T  If the target is dodging: the attacker’s Fighting skill 
is opposed by the target’s Dodge skill. If the charac-
ter performing the maneuver achieves a higher level 
of success than the character dodging, the maneuver 
is successful (if tied, the target is able to dodge the 
maneuver).

T  If the target is fighting back: the attacker’s Fighting 
skill is opposed by the target’s Fighting skill. If the 
character  fighting  back  achieves  a  higher  level  of 
success, the maneuver fails and the opponent inflicts 
damage on the character performing the maneuver 
(if tied, the maneuver is successful). 

T  The target of an attack may use a maneuver of their own: 
Resolve as for fighting back, but instead of inflicting 
damage, apply the effect of their maneuver.

A  successful  maneuver  allows  the  character  to  achieve 

one goal, such as:

T  Disarming an opponent, or wresting an item such as 

a book out of the opponent’s hand.

T  Place the enemy at an on-going disadvantage, either 
inflicting one penalty die on the opponent’s future 
actions or granting one bonus die to allies’ actions 
taken  against  the  target  (choose  whichever  seems 
most  appropriate  to  the  situation).  This  disadvan-
tage  may  be  as  a  result  of  physical  restraint  or  of 
having been knocked to the floor. 

T To escape when physically restrained by another char-
acter. The restrained character may use a maneuver 
of their own on their turn to break out of a hold, such 
as a bear hug or neck lock; otherwise they are auto-
matically  held  until  their  attacker  releases  them,  is 
incapacitated or suffers a major wound (see Wounds 
and Healing, page 119).
T  Pushing  an  opponent  over  a  cliff,  out  of  a  large 
window or simply knocking the opponent to the floor.

The Keeper may inflict damage on those engaged 
in a maneuver if it is appropriate to the events in the 
story—clearly  someone  falling  from  a  second  story 
window is going to take damage unless they land in a 
safety net or similar.

Striking the First Blow (Surprise)
Something must happen to start a combat; someone 
must strike the first blow. Opponents may square up 
to  each  other  like  two  boxers  in  the  ring,  knowing 
they are engaged in a fight even before the first punch 
is thrown. If this is the case, the Keeper should start 
a combat round. 

Alternatively the attack may be a complete sur-
prise;  a  sudden  knee  to  the  groin  or  punch  to  the 
jaw, for example. When someone states that they are 
making  a  sudden,  unexpected  attack,  they  should 

106 

Call of Cthulhuhave  the  opportunity  to  surprise  their  opponent.  If  the 
Keeper were to automatically switch to combat rounds (see 
below), the person who declared the first attack may end up 
acting last in the DEX order, which would make no narrative 
sense. 

Of course if the target has their wits about them, they 
may  see  the  attack  coming.  The  Keeper  may  allow  a  skill 
roll to determine if the target anticipates the attack, using 
either  Listen  or  Spot  Hidden  to  hear  or  see  it  coming,  or 
Psychology to perceive the attacker’s intent. The Stealth skill 
of the attacker can be used to set the difficulty level for the 
investigator’s  Listen,  Spot  Hidden,  or  Psychology  skill,  or 
vice versa if the investigator is the one making the surprise 
attack  (remembering  that  the  player  should  be  rolling  the 
dice where possible). 

Depending on the outcome of the roll:
T  If the target anticipates the attack, they may choose 

to dodge or fight back.

T  If the target fails to anticipate the attack, the Keeper 
may allow the attack to be an automatic success (un-
less a fumble is rolled) or award the attacker a bonus 
die,  depending  on  the  situation.  If  the  attacker  is 
making a ranged attack (for example with a gun or 
throwing knife), a roll should always be made to hit.

Harvey struggles with the thug as the cultist flees.

Harvey: DEX 55

Fighting (Brawl) skill: 25 (Regular) / 12 (Hard) / 5 (Extreme)
Dodge skill: 27 (Regular) / 13 (Hard) / 5 (Extreme)
Build: 0
Thug: DEX 50     

Fighting skill: 35 (Regular) / 17 (Hard) / 7 (Extreme)
Dodge skill: 25 (Regular) / 12 (Hard) / 5 (Extreme)
Build: 1

Harvey is following a cultist that he knows to be carrying a copy of the Book of Eibon in a briefcase through Boston. 
When he loses sight of the cultist in the crowd, Harvey makes a Spot Hidden roll and fails. Harvey runs down the street 
looking in every side alley. The Keeper grants a pushed Spot Hidden roll, which is also failed. As a consequence the Keeper 
tells how Harvey follows his target into the shadows of one of those alleys, only to be jumped by a knife-wielding thug 
demanding money. 
The first round:

Harvey has the higher DEX and therefore goes first. 

Harvey’s Action:

Harvey tries to push the thug out of his way and run past; it’s a risk, but Harvey knows that he will lose the trail if he 

delays. This is a Fighting Maneuver, the goal being to push the thug away long enough for Harvey to run past.

The thug has a Build 1. This is one point higher than Harvey’s Build (of zero) so Harvey will have one penalty die. 
The thug is fighting back, attempting to stab Harvey. The thug has a knife and so uses his Fighting (Brawl) skill to attack.

Harvey’s player rolls with a penalty die, getting 12 and 22. He must take the higher roll—a Regular success. 
The Keeper rolls 03 for the thug—an Extreme success. 
 While trying to push the thug aside, Harvey is stabbed for 6 points of damage (1D4 for the switchblade and 1D4 
damage bonus). If this had been the thug’s action, the Extreme success would have resulted in an impale for 8 + 1D4 
damage (maximum weapon damage and maximum damage bonus plus a roll for weapon damage).
The thug’s action:

The  thug  threatens  Harvey  with  the  knife  and  demands  money.  Harvey,  knowing  that  he  is  badly  injured  and 

outmatched, surrenders his wallet.

107 

chapter 6: combat 
 
 
 
 
 
Ranged and Thrown Weapons
Ranged missile attacks (such as bows) are treated like firearms 
(target has the option of Diving for Cover, page 113).

Thrown weapons may be opposed with the Dodge skill 
in the same way as Fighting attacks (see Resolving a Fighting 
Attack Made Against a Target that is Dodging, page 103).

A character may not choose the option of fighting back 
against a ranged (missile) or thrown weapon attack unless he 
or she is within one-fifth of their DEX in feet near the attacker.
Half  the  attacker’s  damage  bonus  is  applied  to  thrown 
and missile weapons that rely on the user’s strength—this 
applies to bows and slings but not to crossbows.

To resolve a ranged or thrown attack, the Keeper should 
set  a  difficulty  level  as  for  a  firearm  attack  (see  Firearms 
Difficulty Levels, page 112).

Escaping Close Combat
A  character  can  use  their  action  to  flee  melee  combat  on 
their  turn  in  the  order  of  combat,  providing  they  have  an 
escape route and are not physically restrained. 

Armor
Armor  reduces  damage  received,  whether  it  is  the  natural 
armor of some monsters, body armor worn by a character, 
or the natural defense of an obstacle between the attacker 
and  the  target.  Deduct  the  number  of  armor  points  from 
damage inflicted by attacks passing through the armor.

Note that armor will not reduce damage from magical 

attacks, poison, drowning, etc.

A deep one surprises an investigator. 

Note:  Hitting  someone  on  the  head  (when  attacking 
unseen) from the rear would automatically succeed (unless 
fumbled), whereas seizing a weapon from someone’s hand 
would only receive a bonus die.

When attacking a target that is unable to or chooses not 
to dodge or fight back, the attacker should roll their attack 
normally,  but  will  only  fail  to  hit  if  they  roll  a  fumble.  It 
should be remembered that the Keeper decides when dice 
rolls are called for. If a person doesn’t wake up, why would 
a dice roll be required to stab or shoot them in their sleep?

Once  a  surprise  attack  has  been  resolved,  the  Keeper 

should then switch to combat rounds as detailed below.

Outnumbered
When  a  character  is  outnumbered  by  the  opposition,  the 
character is at a disadvantage. Once a character has either 
fought  back  or  dodged  in  the  present  combat  round,  all 
subsequent melee attacks on them are made with one bonus 
die. This does not apply to attacks made using firearms.

Characters  and  monsters  that  have  more  than  one  at-
tack per round may also dodge or fight back that number 
of times before the bonus die is applied. Thus a ghoul with 
three attacks can fight back three times before its attackers 
gain a bonus die. Note that some Mythos entities can never 
be  outnumbered  by  investigators  (see  Chapter  14:  Mon-
sters, Beasts and Alien Gods).

Even an old piece of metal will work as armor.

chapter 6: combatHarvey and his friend Rodger spot the cultist they suspect to be carrying the Book of Eibon in a briefcase. The cultist 
is standing on the station platform, awaiting a train. Harvey takes advantage of the fact that they have not met and 
approaches the cultist to enquire when the next train is due.

Hit points: 15

Harvey attempts to snatch the briefcase from the cultist. The Keeper rules that this constitutes a fighting maneuver 
(see Fighting Maneuvers, page 105) since it will clearly initiate a combat and it is similar in intent to disarming an op-
ponent. The cultist’s DEX is higher than Harvey’s, but he is not aware of being in combat until Harvey acts, although he 
may anticipate Harvey’s action—see Striking the First Blow (Surprise Attacks), page 106. Using the rules for surprise 
attacks, the Keeper asks for a Stealth roll from Harvey, setting the difficulty level as Regular (the cultist’s Spot Hidden skill 
is below 50). Harvey is successful and the cultist doesn’t see the attack coming.
Harvey’s surprise attack:

Harvey attempts to snatch the cultist’s case using a fighting maneuver. The cultist does not get a chance to dodge or 
fight back as he is unaware of the attack. Harvey gained a surprise attack and so has one bonus die for his maneuver. 
When figuring the outcome of a Fighting maneuver, the opponent’s Build must always be factored in. The cultist’s Build 
is one step above Harvey’s, so Harvey gains a penalty die. The bonus die and penalty die cancel each other out.

An 11 is rolled for Harvey’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Hard success.
No opposing roll is made for the cultist on account of Harvey having the advantage of surprise.
Harvey snatches the bag from the cultist.
Now that Harvey’s surprise attack is concluded, the Keeper switches to using combat rounds (see Striking the First 

Blow, page 106).
Combat round one:
Rodger’s action:
Rodger has the highest DEX and so acts first. The Keeper asks what Rodger is doing (see Declaration of Intent: 
“What is your character doing?” page 102). Rodger’s player leans forward and tells how Rodger is going to grab the 
cultist from behind, keeping hold of him while Harvey punches the cultist’s lights out. The Keeper interprets this as a 
fighting maneuver with the goal of restraining the cultist. Both sides have equal Builds, so there are no bonus dice or 
penalty dice. The cultist tries to fight back, with an elbow to Rodger’s gut.
29 is rolled for Rodger’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Regular success.
21 is rolled for the cultist’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Regular success.
In the case of a draw with an opponent that is fighting back, the attacker wins.
Rodger’s maneuver is successful and he has grabbed hold of the cultist. The cultist’s blow fails to connect.
Cultist’s action:
The cultist acts next. He struggles to break free of Rodger’s hold, as Rodger strives to keep him held. The cultist is 
making a fighting maneuver. Rodger is simply trying to keep his hold on the cultist. The hold will only be broken if 
the cultist wins the maneuver, otherwise the status quo will remain. The cultist has a penalty die as a result of being 
restrained (see  Fighting Maneuvers, page 105).

Either 82 or 02 (penalty die) is rolled for the cultist’s Fighting (Brawl) skill, the highest roll is used—a Failure.

110 

Call of Cthulhu 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rodger rolls a 24 for his Dodge skill—a Regular success.
The cultist fails to break free. Neither side inflicts damage on the other.
Harvey’s action:
Harvey has the briefcase in his hands, and the cultist is restrained before him. Harvey uses the briefcase as an 
improvised weapon (see Improvised Weapons, page 104) to bash the cultist in the face. The Keeper decides to allow 
Harvey to use his Brawl skill for the attack. The cultist has already fought back this round (versus Rodger) and so 
Harvey  gets  a  bonus  die  (see  Outnumbered,  page  108). The  cultist  attempts  to  dodge,  but  suffers  one  penalty  die 
because he is being restrained. 

Either 19 or 89 (bonus die) is rolled for Harvey’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Regular success.
Either 01 or 71 (penalty die) is rolled for the cultist’s Dodge skill—a Failure.
The Keeper decides the briefcase will do the same damage as a small club, 1D6. The cultist takes 3 points of damage.

Combat round two:

Other commuters are shocked at the conflict that is taking place, but no one steps forward to intervene.
Rodger’s action:
Rodger already has hold of the cultist, so he doesn’t need to roll dice unless he wishes to do anything in addition to 
continuing to hold him. Rodger decides he’s going to take advantage of his hold on the cultist to slam the cultist’s face 
against a nearby pillar. The cultist attempts to break free. Both sides will make a fighting maneuver roll. The cultist has 
one penalty die for being restrained.

Rodger gets a 49 for his Fighting (Brawl) skill—a failure.
Either 11 or 81 (penalty die) is rolled for the cultist’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a failure.
Rodger fails to hurt the cultist and the cultist fails to break free. The cultist is still held and the two of them are 

struggling around the platform.

Cultist’s action:
Instead of struggling to break free, the cultist now raises his feet to waist height and pushes against the nearby pillar, 
attempting to overbalance Rodger onto the floor. Rodger continues to hold on and to resist being toppled. Since his goal 
is to avoid the attack, this will use Rodger’s Dodge skill. The cultist has one penalty die for being restrained.

Rodger gets 32 for his Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Regular success.
The Keeper rolls 03 twice (penalty die) for the cultist’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—an Extreme success.
The  Keeper  rules  that  hitting  the  concrete  floor 
is  worth  1D6  damage  (like  a  club)  plus  the  cultist’s 
1D4  damage  bonus.  Rodger  takes  the  maximum  of 
10 points of damage as a result of the Extreme success 
(see  Determining  Damage,  page  103).  This  drops 
Rodger’s  hit  points  to  4.  This  is  a  major  wound  (see 
Wounds and Healing, page 119) and as a result Rod-
ger  is  automatically  knocked  prone  and  must  release 
his hold on the cultist. Rodger passes a CON roll and 
remains conscious.

Harvey’s action:
Harvey hates to leave his friend like this, but fig-
ures the cultist will probably chase after him, and so 
he flees the scene. 
Combat round three:

Rodger is prone on the floor. The cultist is running 

after Harvey.

Rodger’s action:
No  action  has  been  taken  against  Rodger  this 
round, so he is free to stand up and act. He draws a 
throwing  dagger  from  his  belt  and  throws  it  at  the 
cultist’s  back.  This  is  a  thrown  weapon  attack;  the 
Keeper decides that the cultist will not be able to dodge 
it because he is unaware of the attack (see Ranged and 
Thrown Weapons, page 108), but Rodger still has to 
roll to hit.

A  Failure  is  rolled  for  Rodger’s  Throw  skill.  The 

dagger misses.

chapter 6: combatCultist’s action:
The  cultist  uses  his  Dominate  spell  to  command 
Harvey to, ‘Stop where you are”. The rules for magic 
and  spells  are  covered  in  a  later  in  this  book,  and 
all  we  need  to  know  is  that  the  spell  fails.  However 
Harvey,  knowing  that  he  is  unlikely  to  outrun  the 
cultist, chooses to pretend that he is under the cultist’s 
command; the player has an idea of her own…

 Harvey’s action:
Harvey feigns being under the cultist’s command 
as his enemy approaches. Harvey’s player then asks if 
perhaps the train is pulling in at that moment? The 
Keeper  hadn’t  previously  remarked  upon  the  train 
and  decides  to  allow  a  Luck  roll  to  determine  the 
situation. Harvey’s Luck roll is a success and the train 
is just pulling in as the cultist reaches to take the case 
from him. Harvey seizes the opportunity to push the 
cultist in front of the train, using the briefcase.

This action will require a successful fighting ma-
neuver. The Keeper loves the idea and grants Harvey a 
bonus die for his clever manipulation of the situation. 
The cultist tries to take the bag, and the Keeper decides 
that his goal is to spin Harvey round and throw him 
before the train! Both sides are making a fighting ma-
neuver. Harvey will take one penalty die because his 
Build is 1 point lower than the cultist’s. This cancels 
out the bonus die awarded by the Keeper.

08 is rolled for Harvey’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a 
Hard  success.  23  is  rolled  for  the  cultist’s  Fighting 
(Brawl) skill—a Regular success.

Harvey  keeps  hold  of  the  case  and  pushes  the 
cultist in front of the train; the Keeper doesn’t bother 
rolling for damage!

Harvey  goes  on  vacation  to  Innsmouth  and  en-
counters a deep one while exploring the caves under 
Darke’s Travelling Circus of Earthly Delights. A man 
of action, Harvey successfully clubs the deep one for 5 
points of damage. The deep one has tough, leathery 
skin  and  scales,  giving  it  1  point  of  natural  armor. 
The Keeper deducts 1 from the damage, thus Harvey’s 
strike only does a total of 4 damage.

The deep one is none too happy and advances on 
Harvey, its needle sharp teeth glinting in the beam of

Firearms

It is true that I have sent six bullets through the head of my 
best friend, and yet I hope to show by this statement that I am 
not his murderer.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Thing on the Doorstep

To resolve a firearms attack, make a 1D100 roll and compare 
the result with the attacker’s Firearms skill (using the appro-
priate specialization).

The firearms roll is not opposed. The difficulty level is 
determined by the range, with various other factors granting 
either penalty or bonus dice. A failure never deals damage. 

Firearms and the DEX Order
It  takes  less  time  to  pull  a  trigger  than  to  swing  a  club  or 
sword, therefore readied firearms may shoot at DEX + 50 in 
the DEX order.

Range and Firearms  
Difficulty Levels
The  difficulty  level  of  a  firearms  skill  roll  is  always  set  ac-
cording to range. Each doubling of range above the weap-
on’s  listed  base  range  on  the Weapons  Chart  increases  the 
difficulty level by one step. 

T  Within the base range: Regular difficulty level.
T  Long  range  (up  to  twice  the  base  range):  Hard 

difficulty level.

T  Very long range (up to four times the base range): 

Extreme difficulty level.

Any further modifiers use bonus or penalty dice.
At very long range, when only an Extreme success will 
hit  the  target,  an  impale  only  occurs  with  a  critical  hit  (a 
roll of 01).

112 

Call of CthulhuFirearm Attack Modifiers
Once the difficulty level of a firearms attack has been set, all other 
factors that lend a distinct advantage or disadvantage are taken 
into account. Some options follow, but others may occur to you 
during play. Modifiers grant either a bonus die or a penalty die.

Diving for Cover (Penalty die)
A target that is aware of being fired upon may react by diving 
for cover. This may mean jumping behind a physical barrier, 
throwing oneself to the floor, or ducking and diving at speed 
in an attempt to present a more difficult target.

Diving  for  cover  requires  a  Dodge  roll.  If  this  is  suc-
cessful,  the  target  presents  a  more  difficult  target  and  the 
attacker gets one penalty die.

Diving for cover is a desperate response to a desperate 
situation. A character that opts to dive for cover forfeits their 
next  attack  (regardless  of  whether  they  were  successful  or 
not). If they have already used their attack this round, they 
forfeit their attack in the following round. The only option 
available to a character that has dived for cover, until their 
next  attack,  is  to  dodge  further  attacks.  If  an  individual 
with multiple attacks dives for cover, they forfeit all of their 
attacks, not just a single attack.

Cover and Concealment (Penalty die)
The degree of protection offered by cover is at the Keeper’s 
discretion; a wooden fence may not stop a bullet, but it does 
obscure the target, making the shot more difficult. Conceal-
ment of at least half of the target adds one penalty die to a 
firearms attack. 

A target that breaks cover even briefly (to fire shots for 
example)  may  be  targeted  by  another  character—if  that 
character is holding his or her turn.

Point-Blank Range (Bonus die)
If  the  target  is  at  point-blank  range—within  a  fifth  of  the 
shooter’s DEX in feet—the attacker gains a bonus die.

An attacker that is using a firearm at point-blank range 
may  be  targeted  by  melee  attacks  and  could  be  disarmed 
with  a  successful  fighting  maneuver  on  their  opponent’s 
turn. A target may not fight back against or dodge a Firearm 
attack as they can a Fighting attack.

Aiming (Bonus die)
The intention to take careful aim must be declared on the 
character’s  turn  in  the  order  of  combat.  The  shot  is  taken 
on the same turn in the order of combat on the following 
round. If no other actions are taken before the shot is fired, 
the  attacker  gains  one  bonus  die.  If  the  aiming  character 
takes  damage  or  moves  while  aiming,  the  advantage  of 
aiming is lost. Only one bonus die may be gained by aiming.

Fast-Moving Targets (Penalty die)
A  target  that  is  moving  at  full  speed  (MOV  8  or  more)  is 
hard to hit; apply one penalty die. 

Target Size (Bonus or Penalty die)
Smaller targets are harder to hit. If the target is Build –2 or 
smaller, apply one penalty die.

Larger targets are easier to hit. If the target is Build 4 or 

larger, apply one bonus die. 

Reloading Firearms (possible Penalty die)
It takes one combat round to load two shells into any hand-
gun, rifle or shotgun. Allow one round to exchange a clip. 
Allow two rounds to change a machine gun belt.

In a round, it is possible to put one round in a chamber 

and get that shot off with one penalty die.

Handguns, Multiple Shots (Penalty die)
Many handguns are capable of firing 2 or 3 shots per round. 
Firing  one  shot  allows  for  a  more  careful  aim  and  steadying 
of the weapon. Firing more than one shot places speed above 
accuracy. When firing two or three shots in one round, roll for 
each shot individually, with all shots receiving one penalty die. 

Harvey is shooting a single shot from his pistol at a 
target at normal range, so the difficulty level is Reg-
ular. On the next round he fires three shots. Harvey’s 
player  rolls  for  each  shot  (at  Regular  difficulty), 
applying a penalty die to each roll.

Harvey shoots at the Deep One.

chapter 6: combatFiring into Melee Combat
Combatants  in  melee  combat  are  constantly  on  the  move 
and  may  obscure  one  another.  One  penalty  die  is  applied 
when  targeting  a  combatant  involved  in  melee  combat.  A 
fumble indicates an ally has been hit. If multiple allies are 
in the line of fire, the one with the lowest Luck score is hit.

Automatic Fire
If  using  automatic  fire  an  attacker  can  make  one  pull  of 
the  trigger  in  one  combat  round.  The  automatic  weapon 
will then continue firing until the trigger is released or the 
ammunition is expended (called full auto). Some weapons 
are limited to fire a burst (i.e. 2 or 3 bullets) rather than full 
auto, while others may be switched to fire semi-automatic 
(single bullets), and/or burst or full auto.

For  full  auto:  the  player  declares  the  number  of  rounds 
(bullets)  to  be  fired,  which  may  be  any  number  up  to  the 
capacity of the gun before rolling the dice. Due to the recoil 
of automatic weapons, it is very hard to place a high number 
of rounds in a single target. To simulate this, the number of 
bullets fired is divided into a series of volleys, with an attack 

roll made for each volley.

A  volley  is  a  number  of  bullets  up  to  or  equal  to  the 
firer’s  Submachine  Gun  (SMG)  or  Machine  Gun  (MG) 
skill  divided by 10 and rounded down: simply read the tens 
digit of the skill value. Regardless of skill, a full auto volley is  
never  fewer  than  3  bullets.  For  example:  a  character  with 
Firearms  (SMG)  47%  would  fire  four  bullets  in  a  volley. 
A character can fire full auto (multiple volleys) in a single 
round  until  their  ammunition  runs  out,  although  the 
chances of hitting reduce after the first volley has been fired.

For  burst  fire:  one  pull  of  the  trigger  fires  2  or  3  bullets, 
this being considered the best combination of accuracy and 
conservation  of  ammunition.  This  is  simply  treated  as  a 
volley of 2 or 3 shots (depending on the firearm; the user’s 
skill plays no role in determining the number of bullets).

When  firing  semi-automatic  (ie.  multiple  single  shots): 
apply a penalty die to each shot, making a skill roll for each 
bullet  fired,  just  as  when  firing  multiple  rounds  from  a 
handgun see Handguns, Multiple Shots (page 113).

Rolling to hit with automatic fire:

First attack roll: apply the usual rules for a firearms attack 
roll (set difficulty by range and then apply any modifiers).

Sometimes taking cover is more advantageous than fighting back.

Call of CthulhuHarvey  is  investigating  the  disappearance  of  his  old  friend,  Nott.  He  hears  a  strange  sound  coming  from  an  upstairs 
room, pulls out his gun (.38 revolver), and cautiously opens the door. Peering inside, Harvey sees a shape crouching in 
the semidarkness—he wonders if it is human or animal. Harvey calls out, “Stop where you are. I’m armed!” Baring teeth 
and hissing, the thing rears up and charges at Harvey, who lets off a shot, and the Keeper begins a combat round. Sanity 
rolls would have to be made for encountering these monsters, but this will be explained in a later chapter—for now let’s 
accept that Harvey remains steadfast.
Harvey: DEX 55

Firearms (Handgun) skill: 20 (Regular) / 10 (Hard) / 4 (Extreme)
Dodge skill: 27 (Regular) / 13 (Hard) / 5 (Extreme)
Damage Bonus: none
Build: 0 
Hit points: 15

Monster: DEX 60     

Fighting (Brawl) skill: 40 (Regular) / 20 (Hard) / 8 (Extreme)
Dodge skill: 30 (Regular) / 15 (Hard) / 6 (Extreme)
Damage Bonus: none
Build: 0
Hit points: 14

Round one:

Harvey has already announced he is firing and will do so on DEX 105 (DEX+50) since his gun was readied (see 
Firearms and the DEX Order,  page  112). The  creature  goes  second  with  its  DEX  of  60. Without  a  readied  firearm, 
Harvey would have acted after the creature.

Harvey’s action:
Harvey’s handgun can fire up to three shots each round, but he decides to fire only one steady shot to maximize his 
chance of hitting. As the target is within the base range of the handgun, Harvey requires a Regular level of success to hit. 
This shot is taken at point-blank range, so he gets a bonus die on the attack roll (see Point-Blank Range, page 113). 
Harvey’s Handgun skill is 20%, and he hits with a Regular success (rolling a possible 58 or 18). The revolver does 1D10 
damage, blowing a chunk out of the creature (5 points of damage).

Monster’s action:
Now that it is upon him, Harvey can clearly see the creature is not human at all, but more dog-like. It attacks him 

with its clawed forelimbs. Harvey opts to dodge the attack. 

The Keeper rolls 31 for the creature’s attack, using its Fighting skill of 40—a success. 
Harvey’s player rolls 12 (under half his skill—a Hard success) for his dodge, and avoids the blow.

Round two: 

Harvey acts first again, as his pistol is readied.
Harvey’s action:
Harvey fires off three shots in rapid succession. The range is point-blank, so Harvey gains a bonus die on each shot, 
but this is negated by the penalty die on each shot for firing multiple shots in one round from a handgun (see Handguns,  
Multiple Shots page 113).

Three dice rolls are made in turn, one for each of Harvey’s shots (each requiring a Regular level of success): 04, 27 and 
92. Two of the shots miss, but the first is an Extreme success. The Extreme success is an impale, so the damage is 1D10 + 
10. The thing collapses.
Monster’s action:
It is dead or dying and can take no action.

Round three: 

Before Harvey can check if the creature is dead, he sees two more lurking in the shadows at the far side of the room.
Harvey’s action:
Harvey lifts his gun to fire again. Picking his target with care, he spends a whole round aiming, and gains a bonus die 

on the shot (see Aiming, page 113). 

Monster’s action:
The creatures appear to be feeding on something, heedless of the recent deafening gunshots, and are ignoring Harvey. 

Round four: 

Harvey’s action:
Harvey fires on DEX 105, after spending a round aiming. The nearest creature is mostly concealed by an overturned 
table. The table looks flimsy so Harvey chooses to shoot through it. The range is around 20 feet, beyond point-blank, but 
within the base range of the revolver (15 yards), so the difficulty level of the shot is Regular. Continued... 

115 

chapter 6: combat 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The creature is partially concealed, so Harvey takes one 
penalty die (see Cover and Concealment, page 113), 
which is negated by the bonus die he gets for aiming.

Harvey  makes  one  attack  roll  for  the  shot  and 
scores a Hard success with a roll of 09. 1D10 is rolled 
for 7 points of damage, which is reduced by 2 points 
for the armor rating of the table, giving 5 damage.

Monster’s action:
Startled by the proximity of the shot, both creatures 

realize the danger and bound for the nearby window.
Round five: 

Harvey runs to the window and empties his gun 
at the fleeing creatures. The Keeper decides that Har-
vey will get one shot at normal range. That’s Harvey’s 
sixth shot and his revolver is empty. 
Round six:

Harvey’s action:
Harvey  loads  one  bullet  and  fires  it  on  the  same 
round at the fleeing creature before it disappears from 
sight. The shot is at very long range (40 yards) so the 
difficulty  level  is  Extreme  (see  Range  and  Firearms 
Difficulty  Levels,  page  112).  A  penalty  die  is  added 
because Harvey is loading and firing a shot on the same 
round  (see  Reloading  Firearms,  page  113).  Harvey’s 
player cheers as she rolls 01 and 01 with the penalty dice, 
giving a final result of 01! A critical at very long range is 
an impale delivering 1D10 + 10 damage that drops one 
of the creatures in its tracks. 
Monster’s action:
The remaining creature escapes unharmed.
Harvey turns and sees the gored corpse of his old 
friend  Nott  lying  at  his  feet,  then  wanders  over  to 
check that the first creature is indeed dead.

Second and further attack rolls: add one penalty die (or re-
move a bonus die) for each additional attack roll. If this would 
incur three penalty dice, stick with two penalty dice and raise 
the difficulty level by one step (from Normal to Hard, Hard to 
Extreme, Extreme to Critical, or Critical to impossible).

The attacker must make a fresh attack roll for each volley 
(or burst) of shots or whenever they select a new target.

All targets should be within a reasonable arc of fire (around 
a sixty-degree arc). Ammunition is expended when moving 
between targets (one bullet per meter/yard). This is simply 
additional wasted ammunition, and for convenience is not 
factored into volley size, attack rolls, or the quantity of shots 
that can be made before incurring penalty dice. 

Resolving each attack roll:

T  If the attack roll is successful: half of the shots fired 
hit  the  target—roll  damage  for  half  of  the  shots 
(round  down,  minimum  of  one).  Subtract  any  ar-
mor from each shot.

T  If the attack roll is an Extreme success: all shots fired 
hit the target, the first half (round down, minimum 
of one) of which impale. Subtract any armor from 

116

each shot. As for all firearm attacks, if the difficulty 
level of the shot was Extreme, the best possible result 
is a successful hit and not an impale.

A shooter with a skill of 63%, firing a full auto (mul-
tiple volleys) at a single target at normal range, makes 
one  attack  roll  for  each  volley  of  6  shots.  The  first 
volley  requires  a  Regular  success.  The  second  volley 
of 6 bullets incurs a penalty die, as this is the second 
attack roll (for shots 7-12), and the third volley takes 
two penalty dice (for shots 13-18).

If  the  shooter  had  announced  they  were  firing 
a fourth volley then the attack roll would incur two 
penalty dice, and the difficulty level (for shots 19-24) 
would increase to Hard.

Alternatively,  if  the  same  shooter  fired  just  12 
shots, dividing them equally between three targets (4 
shots  at  each)  at  normal  range,  the  first  attack  roll 
would be for the 4 shots at the first target. The next 
4  shots  at  the  second  target  would  require  a  second 
attack roll, with one penalty die, followed by a further 
attack roll for the 4 shots at the third target, this time 
with  two  penalty  dice.  In  this  case  the  attacker  has 
chosen to fire three partial volleys of 4 shots (rather 
than the full 6-shot volleys) to conserve ammunition.

Call of CthulhuFor example: Harvey and his two of his friends, Rodger and Cecil, turn up to a prearranged meeting place in an old ware-
house. Suddenly a gangster appears from the shadows, bringing a tommy gun to bear, and opens fire on the investigators, 
initiating a combat round. 
Gangster: DEX 50 

Firearms (Submachine gun) skill: 40 (Regular) / 20 (Hard) / 8 (Extreme)
Fighting (Brawl) skill: 30 (Regular) / 15 (Hard) / 6 (Extreme)
Dodge skill: 25 (Regular) / 12 (Hard) / 5 (Extreme)
Damage Bonus: 1D4
Hit points: 13
Harvey: DEX 55 

Fighting (Brawl) skill: 25 (Regular) / 12 (Hard) / 5 (Extreme)
Dodge skill: 27 (Regular) / 13 (Hard) / 5 (Extreme)
Damage Bonus: none
Hit points: 15
Rodger: DEX 70 

Fighting (Brawl) skill: 40 (Regular) / 20 (Hard) / 8 (Extreme)
Dodge skill: 42 (Regular) / 21 (Hard) / 8 (Extreme)
Damage Bonus: 1D4
Hit points: 14

Round one:

The gangster goes first, firing on his DEX +50 for using a readied firearm. 
The gangster’s action:
One-tenth of the gangster’s SMG skill is 4, so he is able to fire volleys of 4 rounds. He chooses to fire 4 shots at each of 
the three investigators (3 volleys, 12 shots in total). Harvey and Cecil dive for cover, but Rodger pulls a pistol and stands 
his ground. Harvey makes a Dodge roll, but Cecil fails. The Keeper rules that the investigators are each 3 meters apart; 
the gangster wastes 6 extra rounds moving between his three targets (his ammunition is reduced by a total of 18 shots 
this round).

The  gangster  has  a  Submachine  Gun  skill  of  40%. The  targets  are  within  normal  range,  so  the  difficulty  level  is 
Regular. The gangster has a penalty die when shooting at Harvey because he successfully dived for cover (see Diving for 
Cover, page 113). Continued...

A firefight breaks out in the warehouse between a gangster and the investigators.

117 

chapter 6: combatThe Keeper rolls 33 or 43 (with the penalty die for diving for cover) to hit Harvey—a miss.
 Switching to the second target, the Keeper rolls 04 or 04 (with one penalty die for it being the gangster’s second attack 
roll this round) to hit Cecil—an Extreme success, indicating that all the shots hit and that half of them impaled. The 
Keeper makes two rolls of 1D10+2 plus two rolls of 12+1D10+2, totaling 45 points of damage. Cecil is killed outright.

The Keeper rolls the gangster’s third attack with two penalty dice and misses Rodger. 

Harvey’s action:

Harvey dived for cover and so forfeits his next action, which means that there is nothing he can do at present. Harvey 

has taken cover behind a car.
Rodger’s action:

Rodger lets off a shot but misses the gangster.

Round two:

The gangster still has his submachine gun pointing in the investigators’ direction, but Rodger now has a readied pistol 
(DEX 70+50), which means Rodger acts first, followed by the gangster, and then Harvey, still behind the cover of the 
nearby car.
Rodger’s action:

Rodger fires a single shot but misses.

The gangster’s action:

The gangster fires 16 shots at the two investigators (4 volleys, 8 bullets at each investigator). The targets are within 
base range, so the difficulty level is Regular. Harvey remains behind the car, giving him partial cover, so the gangster will 
get an additional penalty die on his attacks on Harvey. Rodger dives for cover and fails. The Keeper rules that the two in-
vestigators are now 10 meters apart; the gangster will waste 10 extra rounds moving between his targets (his ammunition 
is reduced by a total of 26 shots this round, leaving 6 shots in his 50-round drum).

The Keeper rolls 87 to hit Rodger with his first volley of 4 bullets: a miss. He then makes a second attack roll for the 

second volley of 4 bullets, taking one penalty die. He rolls 92 and 72: another miss. 

The gangster then switches targets to Harvey and makes a third attack roll. This time he should have three penalty 
dice, two for making a third attack roll and one for Harvey having partial cover. As the number of penalty dice is capped 
at two, he rolls two penalty dice and the difficulty level for the attack is raised by one step to Hard. He rolls 02, 12 and 
12. 12 is a Hard success, so half the four bullets hit. The Keeper rolls 1D10 + 2  for each hit, giving a total of 6 points of 
damage. The Keeper narrates this, stating that two bullets skim the hood of the car and strike Harvey in the shoulder. 

On his final volley of 4 shots at Harvey, the gangster would gain another penalty die, but as he is already on two 
penalty dice the difficulty level is raised once more to Extreme. This time the Keeper rolls 08, 38 and 98. 98 is both a fumble 
and a malfunction (see Malfunctions, below). The Keeper describes it as a malfunction—the gun jams.
Harvey’s action:

Harvey breaks cover, runs in and punches the gangster. The gangster dodges and Harvey misses.

Round three:

Rodger would normally go first this round with his readied pistol but, as he dived for cover in the last round, he loses 
his next action. Harvey is fighting the gangster in hand-to-hand combat. The machine gun is jammed, but the gangster 
could still strike Harvey with it.
The gangster’s action:

Realizing his gun is jammed, the gangster flees the scene.

Harvey’s action:

Harvey holds his bleeding side and looks in disbelief at Rodger! 

Rodger’s action:

Rodger can do nothing but look aghast as the gangster runs away. 

once per round until succeeding. If the roll is also a fumble, 
the Keeper may choose whether the gun malfunctions or if 
some other outcome occurs, such as hitting an  ally or  the 
wielder injuring themselves in some way.

Malfunctions
Firearms are prone to jamming or misfiring. With any at-
tack roll result equal to or higher than the firing weapon’s 
malfunction number (see Table XVII: Weapons, pages 401-
405), the shooter does not merely miss—his or her weapon 
does not fire. If the weapon is a revolver, break-open gun, or 
bolt-action rifle, the problem is merely a dud round. If the 
weapon  is  lever-action,  the  malfunction  is  a  jam.  Fixing  a 
jam takes 1D6 combat rounds, plus a successful Mechanical 
Repair roll or Firearms skill roll. The user can keep trying

Descriptions of injuries should be appropriate 
to  the  type  and  degree  of  damage  received. 
Thus  the  investigator  is  not  merely  shot,  but 
shot  in  one  arm  or  the  other;  likewise  a  fall 
might  mean  the  investigator  has  sprained  an 
ankle, or now has a lump the back of her skull, 
as well as the hit point loss.

Keepers  should  describe  the  effects  of 
damage and try to avoid simply saying, “You

Tracking Damage
The number of hit points of damage inflicted by an attack 
can  be  used  to  differentiate  between  regular  damage  and 
major  wounds.  Someone  beaten  unconscious  by  punches 
(each  doing  a  small  amount  of  damage)  may  awaken  the 
next  day  battered  and  bruised  but  able  to  act.  However, 
someone  who  takes  the  same  total  amount  of  harm  in  a 
single attack, such as a gunshot, might be out of action for 
a week or more before the slow healing process even begins. 
A  punch  is  likely  to  result  in  regular  damage,  whereas  a 
gunshot is more likely to inflict a major wound.

If the damage from a single attack is:
T  Less than half the character’s maximum hit points, 

it is regular damage.

T  Equal to or more than half the character’s maximum 

hit points, it is a Major Wound.

T  More than the character’s maximum hit points, the 

result is death.

Regular Damage: The Effects 
Regular damage is the result of any single attack that deals 
damage equal to less than half the character’s maximum hit 
points  in  a  single  blow.  It  has  no  significant  effect  on  the 

119 

chapter 6: combatcharacter until current hit points are reduced to zero, when 
the character will become unconscious. A character cannot 
die as a result of regular damage.

Major Wound: The Effects 
A Major Wound results when an attack delivers an amount 
of  damage  equal  to  or  greater  than  half  of  the  character’s 
maximum hit points in a single attack. A character that has 
received a major wound may die if their current hit points 
are reduced to zero.

When a character takes a major wound:
T  Tick the Major Wound box. 
T  The character immediately falls prone. 
T  Make a successful CON roll to avoid the character 

falling unconscious.

T  If  current  hit  points  fall  to  zero  while  the  Major 
Wound  box  is  ticked,  the  character  is  dying  (see 
Dying, ne).

Harvey has 15 hit points. Damage of 8 or more will 
inflict a Major Wound. 

Harvey is attacked by a mad cultist and, over the 
course of the fight, takes 3 damage, then 8 damage. 
His  current  hit  points  are  down  to  4.  The  Major 
Wound  knocks  him  to  the  floor.  He  is  required  to 
make a CON roll for the Major Wound and does so 
successfully, remaining conscious. 

Zero Hit Points: The Effects
Cumulative  damage  ceases  to  be  tracked  once  current  hit 
points have fallen to zero; do not record negative hit points. 
On zero hit points the character is unconscious. 

Further  damage  is  generally  ignored,  but  any  sincere 

attempt to kill an unconscious character should succeed.

Zero  hit  points  can  indicate  one  of  three  conditions 

(akin to the triage model):

T  If only regular damage has been taken, the character 

does not die and will heal in time.

T  If  the  character  has  taken  a  Major  Wound,  the 
character will soon die unless First Aid is adminis-
tered (see Dying). If an uninjured character takes a 
wound  that  is  equal  to  their  maximum  hit  points, 
this would be a major wound.

T  If an amount of damage greater than the character’s 
maximum  hit  points  is  taken  in  one  attack  then 
death is inevitable.

"Argh...I can't reach it"

First Aid
To  be  effective,  First  Aid  must  be  delivered  within  one 
hour,  in  which  case  it  grants  1  hit  point  recovery.  It  may 
be  attempted  once,  with  subsequent  attempts  constituting 
a Pushed roll. Two people can work together to administer 
First Aid, with a success granted if either one of them rolls 
a  success.  An  exception  is  allowed  when  treating  a  dying 
character (see Dying, below), wherein the best that can be 
achieved with First Aid is to temporarily stabilize the patient.

Medicine
Treatment  of  injuries  using  the  Medicine  skill  takes  a 
minimum of one hour and can be delivered any time after 
damage is taken. If this is not performed on the same day, 
the  difficulty  level  is  increased  (requiring  a  Hard  success). 
A  person  treated  successfully  with  Medicine  recovers  1D3 
hit points (in addition to any First Aid they have received), 
except in the case of a dying character (see Dying, below), 
who must initially receive successful First Aid, after which 
they must be stabilized using Medicine (see Major Wound 
Recovery, page 121).

Dying
A  character  is  dying  when  their  hit  points  are  reduced  to 
zero and they have also sustained a Major Wound. Record 
the Current Hit Points as "0" and check the “Dying” box.

The character immediately falls unconscious. The player 
must  make  a  CON  roll  at  the  end  of  the  next  round  and 
every round thereafter; if one of these CON rolls fails, the 
character dies immediately. Only the First Aid skill can be 

120 

Call of Cthulhuused to stabilize a dying character. Medicine cannot be used 
to stabilize a dying character (see Chapter 4: Skills).

The use of First Aid to stabilize a dying character grants 
1  temporary  hit  point,  and  it  must  be  followed  up  with  a 
successful  Medicine  skill  roll.  A  dying  character  that  has 
been  stabilized  with  First  Aid  (on  1  temporary  hit  point) 
should make a CON roll at the end of each hour; a failure 
indicates the patient's condition has deteriorated: they lose 
the temporary hit point and revert to the start of the Dying 
process, in need of First Aid and requiring a CON roll at the 
end of each round. 

The Medicine skill should be used to treat a dying char-
acter after he or she has been stabilized with First Aid. After 
a successful Medicine roll, uncheck the “dying” box on the 
investigator sheet and increase hit points by 1D3. A recovery 
roll  (see  Major Wound  Recovery)  should  be  made  at  the 
end of each further week of care/convalescence.

Continuing the previous example: Harvey suffers 
a further 5 damage. His current hit points fall to zero 
and, since he has taken a Major Wound (8 points of 
damage in a single attack), he is now dying; his play-
er checks the “dying” box and marks hit points as “0”. 
The following round a companion attempts First Aid 
and fails. Harvey’s CON roll is successful and he sur-
vives another round. The companion attempts First 
Aid again, this time he is successful. Harvey gains 1 
hit point and is stabilized (only requiring a CON roll 
per  hour)  and  is  taken  quickly  to  a  hospital  where 
he receives professional medical assistance. The dying 
tick is removed and Harvey gains 2 hit points (1D3 
from Medicine skill roll). After a week of rest Harvey 
makes a recovery roll (see below).

Regular Damage Recovery
Recovering from regular damage is relatively fast. If the char-
acter has not sustained a major wound (the major wound box 
is unchecked) the character recovers 1 hit point per day.

In  another  incident,  Harvey  (who  has  a  total  of 
15  hit  points)  takes  4  damage,  then  6,  then  7.  He 
has taken a total of 17 damage, but as negative hit 
points  are  not  recorded  his  current  hit  points  now 
equal zero. He has only taken regular damage (none 
of the attacks, in themselves, cost more than half of 
Harvey’s  maximum  hit  points)  and  so  Harvey  re-
covers one hit point per day and is back to full health 
after 15 days.

Trips to the hospital will become routine for investigators.

Major Wound Recovery
A CON roll should be made at the end of each week of game 
time that the Major Wound box is ticked,

T  If the CON roll is failed, no recovery takes place that 
week. On a success, 1D3 hit points are recovered.
T  On  an  Extreme  success,  2D3  hit  points  are  recov-

ered.

T  Add a bonus die: If the character has complete rest 

in a comfortable environment.

T  Add  a  bonus  die:  If  the  character  receives  effective 
medical care. The care giver with the highest Medicine 
skill should make one Medicine skill roll at the end of 
the week (before the patient’s CON roll is made).
T  Add a penalty die: If the character is in a poor en-
vironment and is unable to take sufficient rest, and/
or a fumble was rolled on their doctor’s (or nurse’s) 
Medicine skill roll.

A major wound is healed (erase the major wound marker) 
when the character either rolls an Extreme success for their 
recovery  (CON  roll),  or  when  their  current  hit  points  have 
recovered to half or more than half of their full hit point total.
If the roll is a fumble, a lasting injury, complication, or 
worse  condition  results.  Rather  than  rolling  for  a  random 
complication, the Keeper is encouraged to pick something 
that  relates  to  the  nature  of  the  character’s  injuries  (e.g. 
permanent limp, blindness in one eye, missing fingers, loss 
of a limb, scarred face, etc.) and make an entry in the inves-
tigator’s backstory (under Wounds and Scars).

Call of CthulhuHarvey  is  recovering  in  hospital  after  almost  dying 
(see the example for Dying above). He has the best of 
care and complete rest, so gains two bonus dice to his 
recovery  roll. This  roll  gives  a  Hard  success,  granting 
the recovery of 3 hit points (1D3). Harvey is now well 
enough  to  return  home.  He  does  some  light  work  on 
the second week, (thus he has not rested) and, as he is 
no longer under medical care, his recovery roll gets no 
bonus dice. This time he rolls a failure; no recovery. On 
the third week he realizes that he needs to take it easy 
and asks a friendly nurse to look in on him as he rests 
in bed; this grants a bonus die. A Medicine roll is made 
for the nurse’s care (a success), and so he gains a second 
Bonus die. He rolls an Extreme success on his recovery 
roll at the end of week three. He recovers another 5 hit 
points (2D3) and erases the major wound marker. His 
current hit points now stand at 8. He regains one more 
hit point each day, and in seven more days he is fully 
healed to his maximum of 15 hit points.
  Another  example:  Cecil  is  on  an  expedition  is  the 
jungles of South America. He suffers a major wound 
during a fight, receiving a terrible bite to this left arm. 
A friend administers First Aid, but there is nowhere 
for  Cecil  to  rest  properly  and,  anyway,  he  and  his 
companions  are  working  to  a  deadline  to  prevent  a 
cult summoning their dark god. At the end of a week 
he  attempts  his  recovery  roll  with  one  penalty  die, 
rolling a fumble. The Keeper decides the wound has 
become  infected  and  that  the  lower  arm  is  swollen 
and painful; medical treatment is required promptly 
or the infection may kill him. Cecil looks at his com-
panions; one of them is going to have to attempt an 
amputation!

Unconsciousness and Death
Call  of  Cthulhu  is  a  horror  game  and  sometimes  it  may 
be  more  terrifying  for  an  investigator  to  stay  conscious;  if 
the Keeper wishes, a character may be incapacitated rather 
than  fully  unconscious.  Equally,  final  death  does  not  have 
to occur instantaneously, and the light in a character’s eyes 
might not go out until after a particularly dramatic moment 
or once their final words have been uttered (at the Keeper’s 
discretion).

Other Forms of Damage
Often the Keeper will be forced to make a judgment for the 
amount of damage caused by some random event such as 
dropping a TV set on someone’s foot, running into a door-
post, or falling down an elevator shaft. Whatever the cause, 
consider  the  likely  injury  and  rate  it  against  the  left-hand 
column on Table III: Other Forms of Damage.

  Don’t feel compelled to limit yourself to the amounts 
of  damage  listed—you  wish  you  may  increase  or  decrease 
the amounts subject to the circumstances of the situation. 

Each  injury  type  is  for  one  incident  or  one  round;  one 
round  of  being  punched  by  one  attacker,  one  bullet,  one 
round of drowning, one round of being burned. The char-
acter will take further damage on each successive round that 
they are exposed to the source of the harm.

Harvey fails a pushed Stealth roll as he attempts to 
follow  someone  through  a  fairground.  As  a  conse-
quence the Keeper rules that he is struck by one of 
the  moving  fairground  rides.  There  is  no  damage 
listed for fairground rides so he refers to the ‘Other 
Forms of Damage’ table. The Keeper feels it would 
be likely to knock someone unconscious and chooses 
‘Severe’, rolling 1D10 damage.

Spot Rules: Optional 
Rules for Combat

The  main  combat  chapter  contains  all  the  rules  you  will 
need to run fight scenes in your game and you are advised 
to stick with these until you become accustomed to them. 

What follows are a collection of optional rules from which 
you can mix and match as you please. You are not compelled 
to use them just because they are here. Some people prefer 
to  make  spontaneous  judgments  about  each  new  situation 
based  on  its  unique  merits,  while  others  prefer  to  have  a 
strongly defined set of rules to play by. You and your group 
should decide which you prefer.

Rolling for Initiative
If  you  prefer  more  variation  in  combat,  ask  everyone  to 
make  a  DEX  roll  to  determine  the  initiative  order.  Those 
who rolled an Extreme success will be first to act, followed 
by those who rolled a Hard success, then those with a Regu-
lar success, and finally those who failed the roll. 

If  more  than  one  character  achieves  the  same  level  of 
success, give priority to those with the higher DEX value. If 
characters are still tied, use combat skill value to prioritize. 
Those  that  roll  01  (critical)  on  their  DEX  roll  should 
gain a tactical advantage or bonus die on their first attack. 
Those that roll a fumble should forgo their first attack, per-
haps dropping their weapon or tripping.

Once the initiative order has been determined, stick with 

it for the duration of that combat.

Note  down  each  combatant  in  order,  along  with  their 
level of success (for example "Brian, Fail"). That way if ad-
ditional combatants join, they can make a DEX roll and be 
placed in the existing initiative order. This will also be useful 
if characters draw guns, as this will affect the timing of their 
action in the combat round. 

When using this optional rule, a character with a readied 
firearm may roll their DEX with a bonus die. If a character 
draws  a  firearm  during  the  combat  and  has  it  readied  at

Other Forms of Damage

Injury

Damage

Examples

Minor: a person could survive 
numerous occurrences of this level 
of damage.

1D3

Punch, kick, head-butt, mild acid, breathing smoky atmosphere*, a 
thrown fist-size rock, falling (per 10 feet) onto soft swamp.

Moderate: might cause a major 
wound; it would take a few such 
attacks to kill.

1D6

Falling (per 10 feet) onto grass, club, strong acid, breathing water*, 
exposure to vacuum*, small caliber bullet, arrow, fire (burning 
torch).

Severe: likely to cause a major 
wound. One or two occurrences 
would render a person uncon-
scious or dead.

1D10

.38 caliber bullet, falling (per 10 feet) onto concrete, axe, fire 
(flamethrower, running through a burning room), being 6 to 9 
yards from an exploding hand grenade or stick of dynamite, a mild 
poison**.

Deadly: the average person has a 
50% chance of dying.

2D10

Hit by a car at 30mph, being 3 to 6 yards from an exploding hand 
grenade or stick of dynamite, a strong poison**.

Terminal: outright death is likely.

4D10

Hit by a speeding car, being within 3 yards of an exploding hand 
grenade or stick of dynamite, a lethal poison**.

Splat: outright death almost 
certain.

8D10

Being involved in a high-speed head-on collision, being hit by a 
train.

*Asphyxiation and Drowning: a CON roll should be made each round; once a CON roll is failed, damage is sustained each 
round thereafter until death or until the victim is able to breathe. If the character is in a state of physical exertion, a Hard success 
is required on the CON roll.
**Poisons: an Extreme CON roll will halve damage from poisons. Poisons may cause a variety of additional symptoms 
including: stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, sweats, cramps, jaundice, altered heart rate, impaired vision, convul-
sions, unconsciousness, and paralysis. It is up to the Keeper whether the symptoms permit the victim to act or not, or to 
act with a penalty die or an increased level of difficulty.

In certain circumstances, Keepers may allow a poison's effects to be shaken off if the CON roll is a critical success.

124 

Call of Cthulhuthe  start  of  a  round,  they  may  re-roll  their  DEX  roll  with 
a bonus die. If this results in a worse result than previously 
rolled, they may retain their previous place in the order.

Harvey (DEX 55) rolls 13—a Hard success. Colin (DEX 
60) rolls 84—a failure. The cultist (DEX 50) rolls 14—a 
Hard success. Harvey acts first, then the cultist, then Col-
in. If the default system had been used, the order would 
have been Colin, Harvey and then the cultist. 

Another cultist arrives part way through the com-
bat.  The  second  cultist  has  DEX  50  and  rolls  45—a 
Regular success. He slots into the initiative order after 
the first cultist. 

On a later round, Colin draws a gun and at the start 
of the following round he has a readied firearm, so he 
re-rolls his initiative with one bonus die, rolling a Hard 
success. This places him first in the order of initiative.

Knock-Out Blows
The standard rules already allow for a target to be knocked 
unconscious:  when  an  attack  inflicts  a  Major  Wound  (an 
amount of damage equal to or greater than half the target’s 
hit points), the target must make a CON roll to remain con-
scious. Also a target that is reduced to zero hit points will fall 
unconscious automatically.

The standard rules require significant lasting damage, and 
we are accustomed to seeing characters routinely knocked out 
on  TV  and  in  films.  Rather  than  suffering  a  concussion  or 
fractured skull, these fictional characters awake later, rub their 
head, and carry on as if nothing happened.

If you wish to incorporate a movie-style knock-out rule 
into  your  game  then  treat  this  as  a  maneuver  using  blunt 
attacks  (punch,  club,  rifle-butt,  etc.)  If  the  maneuver  is 
successful,  the  opponent  is  rendered  unconsciousness  and 
suffers only 1 hit point of damage. Knock-out attacks may be 
used on any opponent with a skull or similar vulnerable spot 
(humans, deep ones, ghouls, and so on, but not a shoggoth).

Harvey wishes to knock out the security guard at the 
British  Museum.  Harvey  picks  up  a  fire  extinguisher 
and  successfully  sneaks  up  and  hits  the  guard  on  the 
back  of  the  head  with  it.  Referring  to  Striking  the 
First Blow (Surprise Attacks) (see page 106) the Keeper 
decides that because the target is completely unaware of 
the attack, it will be an automatic success. The guard 
takes 1 hit point of damage and is knocked out cold. 

 If Harvey had failed his Stealth roll, he would 
have  attempted  a  fighting  maneuver  with  the  goal 
of knocking the guard out. The guard is a big fellow 
with  Build  1,  one  above  Harvey’s  Build  of  zero,  so 
Harvey  takes  one  penalty  die  on  the  maneuver. 
Harvey  rolls  a  Regular  success  and  the  guard  fails 
to dodge, so Harvey succeeds in the maneuver. The 
guard is rendered unconscious.

Spending Luck to Remain Conscious
If you are using the optional rule for spending Luck points to 
alter  rolls,  Luck  may  be  spent  to  remain  conscious  for  a  few 
extra rounds. Remaining conscious until the end of the current 
round  costs  1  point  of  Luck.  The  cost  doubles  on  successive 
rounds—2, 4, 8, and so on—and should be spent at the start of 
each round. This is a mixed blessing, as an active character may 
present a more attractive target for further damage.

Harvey takes a major wound and fails his CON roll. 
He  automatically  falls  prone,  and  should  become 
unconscious, but he spends 1 point of Luck to remain 
conscious till the end of the present round. At the start 
of  the  following  round  he  spends  2  Luck  points. At 
the start of the third round he spends 4 Luck points. 
A  total  of  7  Luck  points  have  been  spent,  at  which 
point Harvey has reached safety. At the start of the 
fourth round Harvey doesn’t spend Luck points, and 
automatically falls unconscious.

Avoiding Nothing Happening When Both 
Sides Fail Their Fighting Skill Roll
Sometimes during melee combat, both sides simultaneously 
fail their Fighting skill rolls and nothing happens. One way 
to view this is that both sides are being equally ineffective at 
inflicting harm. An alternative point of view it is that dealing 
harm is relatively easy, and that the real skill lies in protect-
ing oneself from harm during a fight. When taking the latter 
approach,  failing  a  Fighting  skill  roll  means  that  you  have 
failed to protect yourself during the combat. Narratively you 
may have missed your target and punched a wall or moved 
the  wrong  way  and  into  your  opponent’s  blow.  There  are 
many ways to get hurt during combat; your opponent’s fist 
is only one of them.

There are three solutions available to you:
T  First use the default rule by which nothing happens 

when both sides fail.

T  Second resolve the situation by breaking the tie in 

favor of the higher skill. 

T  Third  allow  both  sides  to  inflict  damage  as  for  a 
successful attack. The two sides have clashed during 
combat.

This rule is not applicable to ranged or firearm attacks.

Harvey is fighting a deep one. Harvey throws a punch 
and  the  deep  one  fights  back  with  its  clawed  hand. 
Both  roll  a  failure  for  their  Fighting  (Brawl)  skill. 
They have clashed, both hurling blows at each other. 
Harvey inflicts 1D3 damage and the deep one inflicts 
1D6 + 1D4. 

125 

chapter 6: combatConcealed Damage
When you take an injury, do you know how close you are 
to death? This sense of uncertainty can be simulated if the 
Keeper  notes  down  the  points  of  damage  an  investigator 
receives  without  revealing  a  number  to  the  player.  Instead 
the Keeper only describes the injury to the player. Of course 
this is subjective and can be misleading; sometimes a minor 
injury can seem far worse than it is and vice versa. A cut to 
the  head  can  look  terrible;  a  little  blood  goes  a  long  way, 
but it may only represent one or two points of damage. The 
Keeper can always call for a CON roll just to keep the player 
guessing whether they have received a major wound or not 
(of  course  the  investigator  would  only  fall  unconscious  if 
the wound really was a major wound). The Keeper can re-
veal the actual number of points of damage after the event.

Harvey is snooping around an alley when he is shot. 
The Keeper tells how Harvey hears the shot then feels 
the impact in his left leg, and looking down to see blood 
seeping into his trousers. A moment later the pain hits 
him. It’s bad, but Harvey’s player must decide whether 
to go on or get Harvey to a hospital. The Keeper doesn’t 
confirm whether it is a major wound or not, but asks 
for a CON roll anyway. Harvey’s player makes a suc-
cessful CON roll. Later on the Keeper confirms that is 
was not a major wound (only 4 hit points of damage).

Suppressing Fire 
The  aim  of  suppressing  fire  is  to  make  a  group  of  targets 
"dive for cover," since targets that do so cannot return fire. 
The shooter does not nominate a specific target but declares 
that  they  are  bringing  suppressive  fire  upon  a  group.  A 
group of targets might be all the people in one room (such 
as in a bank heist) or any group of people within the gun’s 
firing  arc.  Each  target  in  that  area  then  has  the  option  to 
"dive for cover" without knowing if they will be specifically 
targeted or not. The intention is to simulate the panic that 
people might feel when fired upon.

A  group  of  six  investigators  and  four  non-player 
character allies are trying to rescue a girl being held 
hostage by a cultist. The cultist is dragging the girl to 
a  car,  and  lets  off  three  shots  in  the  direction  of  the 
investigators. The Keeper gives everyone a chance to 
dive for cover. Four of the investigators dive for cover 
(two  are  successful,  two  fail);  everyone  else  stands 
their ground. The Keeper allocates every investigator 
and non-player character a number from one to ten, 
then rolls 1D10 three times to decide who is shot at. 
One non-player character, one investigator that stood 
his ground and one that dived for cover are targeted 
by the bullets. Each attack is then resolved using the 
usual rules.

Once those that wished to dive for cover have done so, 
the Keeper should determine the target or targets from the 
original  group  at  random,  including  those  that  chose  to 
dive for cover. Those that successfully dived for cover will of 
course be harder to hit.

Armor Revisited
Shotguns  fire  a  mass  of  small  pellets,  each  of  which  must 
pierce any armor. The damage for shotguns is rolled using a 
number of six-sided dice. Armor ratings are factored against 
every D6 when rolling shotgun damage. Thus, if an attack 
with a shotgun hits a target wearing a leather jacket (1 point 
of armor), that one point of armor is deducted from each 
and  every  damage  die,  reducing  a  attack  that  deals  4D6 
damage by 4 points.

Some forms of armor offer protection to specific parts of 
the body; for example, a helmet protects the head. The stan-
dard Call of Cthulhu combat rules do not use hit locations 
(see the Optional Hit Location rules below). In the general 
rough-and-tumble of a fist-fight or a fall from a window, it 
is credible that armoring specific parts of the body (such as 
the head) will reduce the overall damage received, and in the 
interest  of  simplicity  and  the  flow  of  the  game  no  further 
rolls need be made. 

However the case of a single specific attack (such as being 
shot) raises the question of whether the shot was to an area 
protected by armor. In the case of such an attack, a Luck roll 
is required. If the Luck roll is successful, the armor was hit 
and the damage is reduced by the armor value. If the Luck 
roll is failed, the attack hit an area not protected by armor. A 
character wearing armor that protects both head and torso 
gains a bonus die on their Luck roll for armor protection. 

A  character  wearing  armor  all  over  their  body  or  pos-
sessing natural armor such as that of an elephant’s skin does 
not require a Luck roll; it applies in all cases. If a weakness 
is spotted in an enemy’s armor—a vulnerable spot, such as 
an open mouth or eye—that area may be targeted, and the 
Keeper should set an increased level of difficulty or penalty 
dice for the attempt.

Optional Hit Locations
Rather  than  using  Luck  to  determine  if  an  armored  part 
of  the  body  has  been  hit,  roll  1D20  and  consult  Table IV: 
Optional Hit Locations.

Sights
Telescopic  sights  effectively  double  the  base  range  when 
using firearms. If using sights with a .303 Lee Enfield rifle 
(base  range  of  110  yards),  for  example,  the  difficulty  level 
would not be increased until the range exceeded 220 yards 
with Extreme range being from 440 to 880 yards. Sights are 
of no benefit at point-blank range.

126 

Call of CthulhuBracing
Bracing a firearm, such as using a bipod, tripod or a mount-
ed weapon, effectively doubles the base range for the weap-
on. Where the weapon is mechanically braced to a structure 
(vehicle or building) the user gains a bonus die.

Movement During Combat
Combat  is  usually  described  narratively,  so  the  distance 
between combatants is rarely measured precisely. It is more 
often  expressed  in  approximate  and  subjective  terms  such 
as "arm’s reach," "close," "across the room," "away down the 
alley," etc. If it seems that distance should be an issue in a 
particular fight, the following rules should be used.

The  maximum  distance  a  character  can  move  in  one 
combat round is equal to their MOV rating multiplied by 
5, in yards. 

In the case of melee attacks, the attacker must get into 

melee range before attacking. 

T  A  character  can  move  a  number  of  yards  equal  to 

their MOV rate and attack normally.

T  If the attacker moves up to their MOV rate multi-
plied by 5, they may make one melee attack at the 
end of the round.

In the case of firearms, shots can be taken by a moving 

character at any time in the round. 

T  To take advantage of the +50 DEX for using a read-
ied  firearm,  the  firearm  must  be  used  before  any 
movement is made.

T  A character can move up to a number of yards equal 
to  their  MOV  rate  and  make  their  firearms  attack 
(or attacks) normally on their usual DEX rank.
T  If  the  attacker  moves  their  MOV  rate  multiplied 
by 5 in yards,  they must fire while running and so 
lack sufficient time to take a steady firing position, 
taking a penalty die to their attack roll(s). The shots 
will  normally  be  taken  on  their  usual  turn  in  the 
DEX  order,  but  may  be  delayed  if  significant  dis-
tance must be covered to reach a firing position (at 
the Keeper’s discretion).

Complete Concealment
If  a  target  remains  completely  concealed  for  the  whole 
round,  an  attacker  may  still  take  shots  through  the  cover 
in  the  hope  of  hitting  their  target.  The  chance  of  hitting 
depends on the size of the area in which the target is taking 
cover; there is a great difference between hiding in a small 
garden shed and hiding in an aircraft hangar. The attacker is 
mostly using intuition to hit the target. If the hiding space is 
small, the Keeper should raise the difficulty level by only one 
step; if there is more space to hide in, raise it again or only 
allow a hit on a critical success, if at all.

Shooting at a Target Through Cover
In some instances of partial concealment, the attacker may 
choose to shoot through the cover in an attempt to hit the 
target. In this case add one penalty die (as for partial con-
cealment) and apply an armor rating for the type of cover, 
for example a low brick wall could provide an armor rating 
of 10, whereas a thin wooden fence might only give 1 point 
of protection (see Armor page 108). 

Shooting through a high brick wall to target someone 
who is hiding behind it (complete concealment): raise 
the  difficulty  level  by  two  steps  and  apply  the  wall’s 
armor rating of 10 to any successful attacks.

Point-Blank Revisited
The point-blank bonus die does not apply to long or cum-
bersome  weapons  such  as  rifles,  full-length  shotguns,  and 
bows,  as  these  are  less  easily  bought  to  bear  on  a  moving 
target at close range. Short-barreled shotguns (of the kind 
designed for home defense) or sawn-off shotguns do gain 
the point-blank bonus die.

127 

chapter 6: combatProne
A prone character is assumed to be lying flat on the ground.
T  Kicking  someone  when  they  are  down  is  easier; 
fighting attacks made against a prone character gain 
one bonus die.

T  A character that is prone may stand up when they 
successfully  dodge  or  fight  back  against  an  oppo-
nent. Alternatively,  when  it  comes  to  their  turn  in 
the  round,  they  may  stand  up  and  then  take  their 
action.

T  Lying down provides a stable position from which 
to shoot; a prone character gets one bonus die when 
making a Firearms roll. 

T  By lying flat on the floor you present a smaller target; 
those targeting a prone character with a firearm get 
one penalty die (ignore this if at point blank-range).

Poisons
Table  III:  Other  Forms  of  Damage  (see  page  124)  covers 
mild, strong and lethal poisons in a simplified manner, and 
is likely to be all you need in the game. If you wish to focus 
on a specific type of poison and its effects, you may find this 
more detailed guide useful.

All poisons are divided into four bands: very mild, mild, 
strong and lethal. The bands indicate the deadliness of the 
poison, and assume a single dose (application, draft, bite or 
sting—depending  on  how  the  poison  is  administered).  If 
multiple doses are received, the victim adds a penalty die to 
their CON roll.

The speed at which the poison acts is determined by the 
administration  method  and  Keeper  discretion.  Fast-acting 
poisons  begin  to  work  within  a  single  round  (death  from 
cyanide  poisoning  could  be  expected  within  a  minute,  for 
example).  Slower  poisons  may  take  hours  or  even  days  to 
register their effects.

Individual poisons cause a range of different symptoms, 
including stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, sweats, 
cramps, jaundice, altered heart rate, impaired vision, convul-
sions, unconsciousness and paralysis. It is up to the Keeper 
whether the symptoms permit the victim to act or not, or 
to act with a penalty die or an increased level of difficulty.

Alongside  the  various  symptoms,  poisons  also  cause 

physical damage.

T  Very  Mild  poisons:  no  damage,  only  temporary 

unconsciousness.

T  Mild poisons: 1D10.

T  Strong poisons: 2D10.

T  Lethal poisons: 4D10.

Those who succeed in rolling equal to or below a fifth of 
their CON suffer a lesser effect. Damage should be halved 
and symptoms reduced as decided by the Keeper. In certain 
circumstances,  Keepers  may  allow  a  poison's  effects  to  be 
shaken off if the CON roll is a critical success. A character 
might push the CON roll by attempting to purge the poi-
son,  through  vomiting,  amputation,  or  bloodletting,  for 
example.  Whether  these  things  would  work  in  real-life  is 
questionable—what matters is the drama.

chapter 6: combatChapter Seven
Chases

The readiness with which I fell into a plan of 
action proves that I must have been subconscious-
ly fearing some menace and considering possible 
avenues of escape for hours. From the first I felt 
that the unseen fumbler meant a danger not to 
be met or dealt with, but only to be fled from as 
precipitately as possible. The one thing to do was 
to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as I could, 
and through some channel other than the front 
stairs and lobby.

—H.P. Lovecraft, "The Shadow Over Innsmouth"

ction  scenes  in  films  and  books  tend  to  fall 
into  one  of  two  categories:  fights  or  chases. 
The extended chase in The Shadow over Inns-
mouth  (quoted  on  the  previous  page)  is  one 
of  the  most  dynamic  and  memorable  action 
sequences in Lovecraft’s work. A chase scene should provide 
just as much drama and excitement as combat. 

A chase is more than a simple test of speed; a good chase 
is made up of a string of dramatic locations that challenge 
the  characters  as  they  race  through  them.  The  characters 
may  begin  in  a  crowded  marketplace  before  moving  to 
narrow alleys, then climbing a fire escape, breaking through 
a window, pursuing each other through an apartment as a 
family eat lunch, and so on.

The chase is played out in rounds (much like combat). 
As each character’s turn begins, the Keeper should describe 
the situation, then ask what actions the investigator is taking 
that  round.  Only  then  should  the  Keeper  determine  what 
dice  rolls  are  required,  the  outcome  of  which  should  be 
incorporated into the story, perhaps changing the situation 
faced by the next player. 

These rules assume the fleeing character has an escape 
route. If a character is trapped then they must escape before 
a chase can ensue.

While some measure of gritty realism can be desirable, 
avoid becoming overly preoccupied with it. Always bear in 
mind that the aim is to create dramatic fiction, not to mirror 
real-world physics.

First, these rules will address a simple one-on-one chase. 
Later in this chapter, chases with multiple participants will 
be explored. These rules are intended for characters involved 
in any type of chase, whether running, swimming or flying, 
and for vehicles of any kind. 

The rules for chases are presented in five parts. 

Part 1: Establishing the chase: A method for gauging wheth-
er  or  not  a  chase  needs  to  be  played  out  in  full.  In  cases 
where the fleeing character is determined to be fast enough 
to get away, the chase will go no further than Part 1.

Part 2: Cut to the chase: Provides the Keeper with a system 
for  laying  out  a  chase,  positioning  all  of  the  participants, 
and deciding the order of play and number of actions each 
participant can make.

Part  3:  Movement:  This  part  covers  the  essential  rules  for 
movement  and  for  dealing  with  the  various  hazards  and 
barriers that might be encountered.

Part 4: Conflict: Provides rules for resolving what happens 
when  characters  and  vehicles  try  to  grab,  strike  or  collide 
with each other. 

Part 5: Supplementary chase rules: Part 5 contains a selec-
tion of additional rules that complement parts 1 to 4. 

Part 1: Establishing the 
Chase
If the fleeing character is significantly faster than his or her 
opponent,  escape  is  likely,  leaving  the  pursuer  far  behind; 
the chase will be over almost as soon as it has begun. A single 
skill roll for each character is used to establish the chase, the 
result yielding one of two options:

G  The  fleeing  character  is  faster  than  the  pursuer,  in 
which  case  it  is  assumed  that  the  pursuer  quickly 
falls  behind  and  the  chase  is  not  played  out.  The 
Keeper simply describes how the pursuer loses their 
quarry in a way that fits the situation.

G  The pursuer is fast enough to catch the fleeing char-
acter. If this is the case, the game picks up the action 
at the most exciting moment—the point where the 
pursuer is closing in on the fleeing character. 

Speed Roll
This  roll  adjusts  each  participant’s  MOV  rating  for  the 
duration  of  this  chase.  Every  vehicle  and  character  has  a 
movement  rating  (MOV).  A  vehicle’s  speed  depends  on  a 
driver’s skill, while a character’s foot speed depends on their 
physical condition. 

Each participant in the chase makes a CON roll (if on 
foot or other self-propelled mode) to test his or her physical 
condition  and  endurance.  Drivers  make  a  Drive  Auto  roll 
(for vehicles) to test their handling of the vehicle.

G  On  a  success:  no  change  to  MOV  rating  for  the 

duration of this chase.

G  On  an  extreme  success:  +1  to  MOV  rating  for  the 

duration of this chase.

G  On a failure: –1 to MOV rating for the duration of 

this chase.

Compare Speeds
The  fleeing  character  escapes  if  their  adjusted  MOV  is 
higher  than  their  pursuer.  The  Keeper  is  free  to  narrate  a 
brief explanation of how this occurs, or to ask the players for 
suggestions. The chase is over and the Keeper should move 
the game on.

If the pursuer’s adjusted MOV rating is equal to or great-
er than that of the fleeing character, a chase is established, 
and the chase rules are bought into play. Proceed with Part 
2: Cut to the chase.

132 

Call of CthulhuPart 2: Cut to the Chase
If  the  fleeing  character’s  MOV  was  not  high  enough  to 
lose  the  pursuer,  the  Keeper  should  move  the  action  onto 
the  point  at  which  pursuer  is  just  two  locations  behind, 
regardless of how the chase started. This short range serves 
to focus play on the exciting part of the chase. Whether the 
characters  started  next  to  each  other  or  a  mile  apart,  the 
aim is to “cut to the chase”. The fleeing character has already 
had one chance to escape using the speed roll. The Keeper 
would normally set the starting range to two locations, but 
may opt for a tenser chase by reducing it to one location in 
exceptional circumstances. It is advised not to set the range 
beyond two locations.

Harvey  was  caught  sneaking  around  some  farm 
buildings. The farmer spotted him at a distance and 
gave  a  shout;  Harvey  turned  and  fled.  The  Keeper 
asks for speed rolls. Harvey’s player makes an Extreme 
CON  roll  and  Harvey’s  MOV  is  raised  from  6  to  7. 
The Keeper fails the CON roll for the farmer and the 
farmer’s  MOV  drops  from  7  to  6.  Harvey  has  the 
higher MOV and so he escapes. The Keeper tells how 
Harvey  glances  over  his  shoulder  to  see  the  farmer 
tripping over in the mud. No chase scene is played out. 
Alternatively,  if  Harvey  failed  his  CON  roll,  the 
situation  would  be  quite  different.  Harvey’s  MOV 
would  fall  to  5  and  the  Keeper  would  establish  the 
chase partway down the farm track with the farmer 
two locations behind Harvey.

Locations
"Location" is a term used to denote a position in the chase. 
The  locations  do  not  need  to  be  equally  spaced;  a  locked 
door or a flight of stairs might separate two locations, while 
another might be a point on a stretch of open road. Loca-
tions  divide  the  chase  into  narrative  chunks,  rather  than 
being a set physical distance. For example, a hotel might be 
divided  into  multiple  locations:  revolving  door,  crowded 
foyer, stairs, lifts, corridors, restaurant, kitchens, bedrooms, 
offices, and so on.

If  a  chase  takes  place  at  the  same  time  as  a  separate 
combat, the Keeper should ensure that the distance between 
locations is not excessive, otherwise you may end up with 
one group of characters running the length of a city block in 
the time it takes another investigator to smash a chair over 
a cultist’s head.

A chase is made up of a string of locations. The Keeper 
should  keep  careful  track  of  which  character  is  at  which 
location.  Depending  on  their  speed,  characters  may  move 
1 or more locations each round. Hazards and barriers (see 
following) are positioned between locations and may slow a 
character’s progress. 

Harvey flees from the farmer.

Keeping Track of the Chase
When  running  a  chase  scene  you  may  find  the  following 
method useful for tracking the various characters.

Take a blank sheet of paper or whiteboard. Draw a line 
of dots half an inch apart. Each dot represents one location. 
Label  the  first  dot  with  a  letter  representing  the  pursuer. 
Then  write  a  letter  for  the  fleeing  character  two  dots  on 
from the pursuer, depending on the opening range (see Cut 
to  the  Chase).  As  characters  move,  simply  cross  out  their 
marker and draw it on its new position. 

An  angry  farmer  is  pursuing  Harvey  down  a  track. 
Following  speed  rolls,  Harvey’s  MOV  is  now  5;  the 
farmer’s  MOV  is  6.  The  Keeper  chooses  to  start  the 
action with the farmer 2 locations behind and records 
the positions thus:

Start:

Farmer

Harvey

The Chase Round
Just as with combat, a chase takes place in rounds and the 
characters act in DEX order. A combat round and a chase 
round are interchangeable.

Dexterity and the Order of Movement
The  question  of  who  gets  the  first  opportunity  to  act  can 
be  an  important  issue  in  a  chase.  Determine  the  order  of 

133 

chapter 7: chasesUsing  
Miniatures 
You may wish to use          
miniatures and model cars to 
track a chase. Just decide 
which miniature represents 
which character and then use 
markers or dots on a piece 
of paper to denote the range 
increments.

movement by ranking the characters’ DEX from highest to 
lowest.  In  the  case  of  a  draw,  use  an  opposed  DEX  roll  to 
decide who goes first.

Movement Actions
Each  character  gets  a  number  of  movement  actions  per 
round.  Movement  actions  are  used  to  move  from  one  lo-
cation  to  the  next.  Faster  characters  get  more  movement 
actions each round than slower characters.

Every  character  and  vehicle  gets  one  movement  action 
by  default.  To  this  is  added  the  difference  between  their 
movement  rating  (MOV)  and  the  movement  rating  of  the 
slowest participant in the chase. Thus the slowest participant 
will always have one movement action; someone with a MOV 
that is 1 above the slowest participant will have 2 movement 
actions,  someone  with  a  MOV  that  is  2  above  the  slowest 
participant will have 3 movement actions, and so on.

Back to Harvey’s attempt to escape from the angry 
farmer. Following speed rolls, Harvey’s MOV is now 
5; the farmer’s MOV is 6. Both get one movement ac-
tion by default. The farmer gets a second movement 
action because his speed is one more than that of the 
slowest character in the chase—Harvey.

Actions in a Chase Round
On  their  turn  in  the  DEX  order  (highest  to  lowest)  each 
character may use their turn to:

i  Move  forward  in  the  chase  (spending  movement 

actions to do so).

i  Initiate one attack* using the Fighting, Firearms, or 

Drive Auto skill.

i  Cast a spell.
i  Perform some other action requiring time and per-

haps a dice roll, such as picking a lock.

*Note that some monsters are capable of multiple attacks 

in one round; these all take place on the monster’s turn.

A  character  may  elect  to  delay  acting  until  another 
character has acted. If this leads to more than one character 
wishing to act simultaneously, the one with the highest DEX 
takes  priority.  If  both  insist  on  waiting  for  the  other,  the 
round may end with neither of them acting.

Pushing Rolls in a Chase
Pushed rolls are not used in a chase. As in combat, a charac-
ter usually has the opportunity for another attempt on the 
following round.

Part 3: Movement

Moving From One Location to the Next
If an area is free of hazards, such as an empty corridor or 
stretch of clear straight road, the cost of moving from one 
location to the next is 1 movement action.

Returning  to  Harvey  being  pursued  down  the  track 
by the angry farmer. Following speed rolls, Harvey’s 
MOV is now 5; the farmer’s MOV is 6. Harvey’s DEX 
is 55. The farmer’s DEX is 50. 
Harvey’s turn:

Harvey  has  1  movement  action  and  moves  for-

ward 1 location. That is the end of Harvey’s turn. 

After Harvey’s Move:

Farmer
Farmer’s turn:

Harvey

The farmer has 2 movement actions and advances 

2 locations. That is the end of the farmer’s turn.

End of Round One:

Farmer

Harvey

At the end of round 1, the farmer has closed the 
gap from 2 locations to 1 location. Clearly if the chase 
continues in the same manner, the farmer will catch 
up with Harvey at the end of next round. If the farmer 
had  the  higher  DEX,  he  would  have  moved  first  in 
round 1 and caught up with Harvey immediately.

Hazards
A  chase  that  takes  place  on  even,  clear  ground  will  soon 
be resolved if the pursuer is faster than the character he or 
she is chasing; or, if both are of the same MOV speed, the 
chase might never end, with one character staying just out 
of range of the other. Either way, this leads to a bland chase 
scene based purely upon numbers. 

134 

Call of Cthulhu 
Skills and Hazards
The  Keeper  will  specify  a  skill  or  choice  of  skills  that  can 
be used to negotiate a hazard, along with a difficulty level. 
The  Keeper  should  welcome  suggestions  from  players  for 
alternative ways in which their investigators might negotiate 
obstacles, and, as always, the Keeper is final arbiter of what 
skill is acceptable. Some examples of appropriate skills are:
G  Climb skill to get over fences and walls, or to climb 

down from a high window.
G  Swim skill to cross a river or lake.
G  Dodge skill to weave through a crowd or avoid fall-

ing over trashcans in a narrow alley.

G  STR to wade through thick mud.
G  DEX to run along the top of a wall without falling 

off.

G  Drive Auto is the appropriate skill in a car chase.
This  list  is  not  exhaustive;  other  skills  may  be  used  if 

judged appropriate.  

As  Harvey  flees  the  angry  farmer,  he  sees  that  the 
section of track ahead is rough and muddy. 
Harvey’s turn:

Harvey charges towards the muddy patch, taking 
big strides; certainly a reckless action! The Keeper asks 
for a DEX roll, which Harvey makes. Harvey moves 
onto the next location, having used his one movement 
action for this round. 
Farmer’s turn:

The farmer has 2 movement actions and reaches 
the same rough muddy hazard. However, the farmer’s 
DEX  roll  is  failed  and  he  slips  and  falls.  Referring 
to  Table  III:  Other  Forms  of  Damage,  the  Keeper 
chooses Moderate Injury, inflicting 2 (from a roll of 
1D6) points of damage. In addition, the farmer must 
pay 1 (1D3) additional movement action. He has al-
ready used all of his movement actions for this round, 
so the delay will cost one of his two movement actions 
in the next round.

Hazards add spice to a chase scene: hairpin bends, slip-
pery  steps,  thorny  bushes,  thick  mud,  and  so  on.  Hazards 
typically  slow  characters  and  vehicles  down,  and  if  badly 
handled, can also cause harm. 

The  Keeper  should  present  the  hazard  and  allow  each 
character  to  decide  how  they  deal  with  it.  Skill  is  always 
factor, and sometimes taking a cautious approach, slowing 
down in order to make a more considered attempt, can help. 
Other times, a reckless approach might be taken to use brute 
force and speed, such as when breaking down a locked door 
or taking corners at speed. 

If a character elects to take a cautious approach, move-
ment actions may be spent to gain bonus dice on the skill 
roll to negotiate a hazard. 1 movement action buys 1 bonus 
die,  or  2  movement  actions  buys  2  bonus  dice  (2  bonus 
dice is the maximum that can be rolled). If the skill roll is 
successful the character or vehicle is not further delayed or 
damaged by the hazard and is free to move on.

If the skill roll to negotiate a hazard is failed, the Keeper 
should  decide  if  damage  is  inflicted  on  the  character  or 
vehicle,  and  how  much,  using  Table  III:  Other  Forms  of 
Damage as a guide for damage to characters, or Table VI: 
Vehicular Collisions (see page 147) for damage to vehicles. 
Failing  to  negotiate  an  obstacle  or  taking  damage  is  also 
likely to slow the character or vehicle; roll 1D3 for number 
of lost movement actions. 

Notice how a hazard is written in the space between two 
dots. The dots represent the locations on either side of the 
hazard. Thus, in the example nearby, the area labeled “mud” 
is a hazard for those travelling from one location to the next. 
After negotiating a hazard a character should move onto the 
next location whether they pass or fail the skill roll.

Summary: Five Steps to 
Setting Up a Chase
To sum up, there are five steps for the Keeper to 
perform when setting up a chase:

G  Place the pursuer.
G  Place the fleeing character.
G  Position hazards and barriers.
G  Allocate  each  participant  a  number  of  move-

ment actions.
G  Determine DEX order.

Barriers
Barriers  block  progress  until  they  have  been  successfully 
negotiated or removed. A barrier might be a locked door, a 
tall fence, an abyss, etc. The distinction between a hazard and 
a barrier may sometimes be unclear. Climbing over a 4-foot 
fence  may  be  hazardous,  but  would  not  stop  a  determined 
person, whereas climbing over a 7-foot wall may well present 
a barrier. Climbing up to a second-floor window would pres-
ent a barrier (if one fails to climb, the window is out of reach), 
whereas climbing down is a hazard (one can always simply 
fall).  The  Keeper  must  decide  when  a  hazard  constitutes  a 
barrier; if it is a barrier it prevents further movement until 
the skill roll is passed or the barrier is broken through. Failing 
a skill roll to pass a barrier may cause damage and delay as a 
hazard  does,  but  the  usual  consequence  is  simply  the  delay 
and inconvenience of not moving to the next location.

Skills and Barriers

G  Jump skill to leap across a chasm or jump from one 

roof to another.

G  STR to force open a door.
G  Locksmith skill to open a locked door or window.

There can be more than one way to get past some barriers. 
A  locked  door  might  be  picked  (using  Locksmith  skill)  or 
smashed open (see Breaking down Barriers below). Equally, 
some characters might seek to climb over a fence (Climb skill) 
while others might simply smash their way through.

G  Police roadblock.
G  A fallen tree.
G  A rockslide.

Sample Barriers for Foot Chases

G  A high fence or wall.

Breaking Down Barriers
Whether  it  be  kicking  down  a  locked  door  or  ramming 
through  a  police  roadblock,  sometimes  brute  force  is  the 
best solution. No attack roll is required. For each point of 
their build, vehicles inflict 1D10 damage to a barrier.

Vehicles are assumed to be travelling at high speed when 
attempting to break through a barrier; therefore, if a vehicle 
attacks a barrier and fails to destroy it, the vehicle is wrecked. 

137 

The  angry  farmer  is  still  pursuing  Harvey. A  post-
and-rail fence blocks his path.
Harvey’s turn:

The  fence  looks  old;  Harvey  charges  forward, 
aiming to burst through it. Harvey inflicts 3 (1D3) 
hit points of damage on the fence. The Keeper decides 
the fence is weak and only had 5 hit points, and so 
is  now  down  to  2.  The  rails  crack  but  don’t  break. 
Harvey remains on the location on which he began 
the round.
Farmer’s turn:

The  farmer  has  a  debt  of  1  movement  action 
due  to  slipping  over  in  the  mud  last  round,  so  has 
one  movement  action  and  is  on  the  same  location 
as Harvey. He spends his movement action to attack 
Harvey, but is unsuccessful.

chapter 7: chasesIf the barrier is destroyed, the vehicle suffers an amount 
of  damage  equal  to  half  the  barrier’s  hit  points  prior  to 
impact.

When a barrier is reduced to 0 hit points it is no longer a 
barrier. The debris that results from smashing a barrier may 
present a hazard to those that follow afterwards.

Sample Barriers and Hit Points:

G  Internal door or thin wooden fence: 5 hit points.
G  Standard back door: 10 hit points.
G  Strong domestic external door: 15 hit points.
G  9” brick wall: 25 hit points.
G  Mature tree: 50 hit points.
G  Concrete bridge support: 100 hit points.

Part 4: Conflict
The characters or vehicles must be on the same location to 
attack one another, unless firearms are involved. Initiating 
an attack costs 1 movement action. Characters are limited 
to  their  usual  number  of  attacks  per  round.  Attacks  are 
resolved as they are in regular combat.

A character should always be given the opportunity to 
respond when challenged (fighting back or dodging) regard-
less of whether they have any movement actions remaining. 
Large monsters or creatures might attack a vehicle aiming 
to inflict damage or to use a fighting maneuver to push, tip or 
even pick up and throw a vehicle (see Builds, page 33).

Vehicles may engage in combat using the regular combat 
rules,  substituting  Drive  Auto  skill  for  both  Fighting  and 
Dodge skills. Treat the vehicle as a weapon that inflicts 1D10 
damage per point of build. Each full 10 hit points of damage 
decreases a vehicle’s build by one point (round down); any 
remaining damage below 10 points is ignored. Whenever a 
vehicle is used to inflict damage, it also suffers an amount of 
damage equal to half (round down) of that which it delivers, 
but  never  enough  to  cause  it  to  lose  a  greater  amount  of 
build points than the target which it hit originally possessed. 

A car might do 50 (5D10) points of damage to a light 
motorcycle,  and  therefore  the  car  would  suffer  25 
points of damage itself (enough to cause a damage of 
2 Build points), but a light motorcycle only has Build 
1, so the damage to the car is limited to 1 build point.

Using Fighting Maneuvers in a Chase
If  a  character  or  vehicle  seeks  to  trip,  push,  or  otherwise 
cause  their  opponent  to  lose  control,  this  can  be  achieved 
with  a  fighting  maneuver.  A  successful  fighting  maneuver 
causes the same outcome as failing a skill roll for a hazard: 
1D3  movement  actions  are  lost  and,  if  appropriate  to  the 
situation, an amount of damage is selected from Table III: 
Other Forms of Damage for characters, or Table VI: Vehic-
ular Collisions for vehicles. Alternatively, if a character has a 
specific goal he or she wishes to set for a fighting maneuver, 
this can be done in the way it would in regular combat (see 
Fighting Maneuvers, page 105).

A  fighting  maneuver  can  be  made  against  a  vehicle  to 
push  it  off  the  road  or  cause  a  loss  of  control.  The  same 
limitations  regarding  build  apply:  if  a  vehicle  challenges 
another vehicle that is 1 build larger that itself, 1 penalty die 
is applied to the attack roll. If the target vehicle is 2 build 
points larger, 2 penalty dice are applied. If the target vehicle 
is 3 build points larger, the maneuver is impossible, as the 
size difference is too great.

At the start of the round, Harvey is in the same loca-
tion as the angry farmer and is trying to climb a fence 
to escape. 
Harvey’s turn:

Harvey fails his Climb roll. The Keeper does not 
inflict any negative outcome; instead he decides that 
the farmer’s attack will suffice. 
Farmer’s turn:

The farmer lunges at Harvey. In response, Harvey 
attempts a fighting maneuver to throw the farmer over 
the fence, planning to run the other way afterwards. 
Both have Build 0 and so Harvey does not take any 
additional  penalty  dice.  The  farmer  rolls  a  Failure, 
but Harvey rolls a Regular success and hurls the farm-
er  clean  over  the  fence!  As  a  result  of  the  successful 
fighting maneuver against him, a skill roll must then 
be made for the farmer as if encountering a hazard. 
The  Keeper  chooses  DEX  as  the  most  appropriate 
attribute to test whether the farmer lands on his feet 
or his back. The DEX roll is failed; the farmer suffers 
a “minor injury” for 3 (1D3) points of damage, and 
1 (1D3) from his movement action. The farmer has 
landed  on  his  back  and  takes  a  few  moments  to  get 
up. This is the end of the farmer’s turn; he has used 
his 2 movement actions for the round (1 to initiate the 
attack, 1 as part of the cost of the fighting maneuver 
used on him). 
The Keeper’s map of the chase:

If  a  character  is  attacked  with  a  vehicle,  that  character 
may fight back or dodge. Successfully fighting back allows 
the target character to avoid an attack and simultaneously 
land one of their own. An investigator’s attack on a vehicle 
is likely to be relatively ineffective; on the other hand, if it is 
dark young that is fighting back against a vehicle, it may be 
a different story.

Call of CthulhuA cultist truck driver is using his Drive Auto skill to 
perform a fighting maneuver, aiming to push Harvey’s 
car off the road. Harvey is trying to avoid the truck, 
using his Drive Auto skill in place of Dodge. The truck 
is bigger than Harvey’s car, so the cultist takes no pen-
alty dice on the maneuver. Drive Auto rolls are made 
for Harvey and for the cultist. The cultist rolls a Hard 
success, Harvey rolls a Regular success; the cultist wins. 
Harvey’s car is pushed off the road and the Keeper 
inflicts  an  automatic  “minor  incident”  result  (see 
Table VI: Vehicular  Collisions,  page  147),  causing 
the loss of another point of build as the car rides over 
the verge and into the ditch. This also costs Harvey 2 
(1D3) movement actions and 2 (1D3) hit points.

Part 5: Optional Rules
“They’re coming to get you, Barbra.”
—George A. Romero, Night of the Living Dead

Parts  1  to  4  have  covered  all  of  the  essential  chase  rules. 
This  final  part  includes  optional  rules  that  can  be  used  to 
embellish and further develop chases. 

Choosing a Route
It  is  the  nature  of  a  chase  that  the  character  being  chased 
(the quarry) wants nothing other than to escape and must 
make split-second decisions whether to turn left or right. If 
there is a choice of routes available, the lead character is free 
to choose and may seek a more difficult path or an easier 
one, especially if he or she feels it would be to their advan-
tage to do so. For example, a strong swimmer might opt to 
leap into the river to lose their pursuer. If the investigator 
is the one being pursued then the Keeper should regularly 
present a choice of routes.

Random Hazards and Barriers
It would be very easy for the Keeper to stack the odds against 
the players by describing new terrain that constantly works 
against the investigators. You may find it more fun all round 
to create hazards and barriers randomly.

Roll 1D100:
01-59 = Clear
60+ = 1 Regular hazard/barrier
85+ = 1 Hard hazard/barrier
96+ = 1 Extreme hazard /barrier

If  the  environment  is  especially  hazardous,  such  as 
driving through rush hour traffic in a bustling city or along 
country lanes at midnight, add a penalty die to the roll for 
random hazards and barriers.

Conflict often arises in the middle of a chase.

If  the  environment  is  unlikely  to  have  any  dangers  or 
delays, such as driving down a quiet freeway, add a bonus 
die to the roll for random hazards and barriers.

Sudden Hazards
Just because an area is free of hazards one moment does not 
mean that it will remain that way. A car may suddenly pull 
out, a pedestrian might run into the road without looking, 
someone might come running around the corner from the 
opposite direction, a loose dog might assault a fleeing inves-
tigator, and so on. 

At  any  point  in  the  chase  round,  either  the  Keeper  or 
a  player  may  call  for  a  group  Luck  roll.  If  the  Luck  roll  is 
passed, events unfold in the player’s favor; the players may 
dictate where and when a sudden hazard occurs. If the Luck 
roll is failed, this indicates a sudden hazard for the investiga-
tors, presented by the Keeper.

Sudden hazards should be of Regular difficulty. Players 
and Keeper should alternate in calling for Luck rolls for sud-
den hazards. If the players call for a Luck roll for a sudden 
hazard, they may not call for one again until after the Keeper 
has called for one and vice versa. Either side may call for the 
first sudden hazard in a chase.

If a chase is becoming a long drawn out affair, the Keeper 
may decide to raise the level of difficulty of sudden hazards.

Pedal to the Metal
When  spending  a  movement  action  to  move  a  vehicle 
forward, instead of moving just 1 location, the vehicle can 
accelerate and move between 2 and 5 locations for the same 
cost of 1 movement action.

139 

chapter 7: chasesHarvey is being chased through Arkham by two police patrol cars. Harvey has 1 movement action, the police have 2. 
Harvey has the higher DEX and moves first in the round.
Harvey’s turn:

His player wants to accelerate and asks how far Harvey can see. The Keeper decides that Harvey can see the next three 
locations, then rolls randomly to determine what they are. The Keeper rolls 29 and 02—2 consecutive clear locations. The 
Keeper then rolls 87 for the third location—a hazard of Hard difficulty level. The Keeper tells the player that Harvey has 
a quiet road in front of him, but up ahead he can see a traffic jam. 

Hazards:

Start of the Round:

Police 1

Harvey puts his foot down, choosing to move 2 locations with his 1 movement action (using the Pedal to the Metal option 
—see below). No one has called for a sudden hazard yet this round, and the Keeper does so now before Harvey actually 
moves, hoping to throw something in Harvey’s way as he accelerates down the open road. Harvey’s player wins the Luck 
roll and she puts the hazard into play right in front of the police car, telling how a delivery truck pulls out in front of the 
police car without looking. In the meantime, Harvey moves on 2 locations.

Hazards:

Police 1

Police 2

Police cars’ turn:

Harvey

P2, the lead police car, spends a movement action to advance 1 location. The Keeper must make a Drive Auto roll for 
the police car (P2) at Regular difficulty level, but fails. The cop car clips the delivery truck. The Keeper chooses a “minor 
incident”. The police car loses 1 (1D3) build point and 2 (1D3) movement actions, sending it spinning into the curb. At 
the end of its turn, the police car (P2) owes 1 movement action, which will reduce its number of actions next round to 1. 
As a reminder, a note is made to the car’s marker on the Keeper’s track:

Hazards:

truck

Police 2 (-1)

P1, the other police car, can see Harvey getting away and accelerates, choosing to move 3 locations with its first movement 
action. The other police car (P2) and truck still present a hazard, especially as some other vehicles have stopped around 
them. Furthermore, because it is accelerating, the police car must take a penalty die when rolling to negotiate the hazard. 
Police car P1 sounds its siren and, with a successful Drive Auto roll, it speeds through. Harvey is now only 2 locations 
ahead, so with its second movement action the police car moves on 2 locations to draw level with Harvey.

Hazards:

End of the Round:

The Keeper called for the sudden hazard during that round. On the following round a player may choose to do so. The 
Keeper is unable to call for another sudden hazard until after the players do so.

The  listed  MOV  speeds  for  vehicles  are  relatively  low, 
only  a  few  points  above  those  of  a  pedestrian.  Of  course, 
vehicles can travel much faster than pedestrians. A vehicle 
has  the  option  of  accelerating;  any  one  of  its  movement 
actions can be spent to travel multiple locations. Travelling 
at higher speeds has its downside of course, making hazards 
more difficult to negotiate.

G  As normal, a driver can use 1 movement action to 

move 1 location. 

G  A driver can elect to move 2 or 3 locations with one 
movement  action.  Any  hazards  encountered  have 
one penalty die applied to the skill rolls.

G  A driver can elect to move 4 or 5 locations with one 
movement  action.  Any  hazards  encountered  have 
two penalty dice applied to the skill rolls.

The increase in speed must be announced prior to mov-
ing.  Just  as  in  real  life,  driving  at  speed  is  less  risky  if  one 
has a good view of what lies on the road ahead. How far a 
driver can see at any time is wholly dependent on the situ-
ation and environment in which the chase is taking place. 
In a crowded city, one might only be able to see a couple of 
locations ahead (1D3 if you wish to determine it randomly); 
in the suburbs one can see several locations ahead (1D6 if 
you wish to determine it randomly), and in the country, on 
a straight road, one might see a considerable distance (1D10 
locations if you wish to determine it randomly). The Keeper 

140 

Call of CthulhuHarvey is being chased by the police.

may  not  have  determined  what  these  upcoming  locations 
are, and should do so as required.

Once a decision has been made to accelerate and travel 
a number of locations on one movement action, it cannot 
be retracted; the vehicle will travel the full distance (2, 3, 4 
or 5 locations) or until it fails a hazard roll. If a hazard roll 
is  failed,  the  outcome  is  resolved,  after  which  any  further 
movement must be paid for and started afresh.

Any  penalty  dice  for  acceleration  should  be  applied  to 
hazards, but usually not when breaking through barriers, for 
which increased speed can be beneficial.

This increased speed can be used multiple times in one 
chase round. By putting the pedal to the metal, a car with 4 
movement  actions  could  potentially  move  20  locations  in 
one chase round.

Escaping the Pursuer
The pursuer can continue chasing the fleeing character so 
long as their location or direction of travel can be identified. 
Each  chase  is  unique,  with  its  own  string  of  locations,  so 
Keeper  judgments  must  be  made  about  points  where  the 
pursuer might lose the quarry. 

A deep one is chasing Harvey through an abandoned 
theater.  At  the  start  of  a  round  the  deep  one  is  still 
in the theater, while Harvey has exited and is now 3 
chase locations ahead. As the deep one exits the the-
ater, the Keeper makes a Tracking roll; can the deep 
one pick up Harvey’s trail? If not, the chase is over.

Hiding
A Fleeing character can attempt to hide from the pursuer at 
any point in the chase. Clearly, having a longer lead will pro-
vide more time in which to hide. The Keeper should weigh  
the situation as with any skill roll before setting a difficulty 
level. If the pursuer fails to find the hidden investigator with 
a Spot Hidden roll, the quarry has evaded capture.

Hiding a vehicle is not easy, but if there are hiding places 
and if the vehicle has sufficient lead, it may be attempted. 
A  combined  Stealth  and  Drive  Auto  skill  roll  (Combined 
Rolls, page 92) is used to hide a vehicle, with the roll needing 
to succeed against both skills.

141 

chapter 7: chasesHarvey  is  fleeing  from  a  deep  one.  The  deep  one 
follows Harvey, who decides to hide in an abandoned 
building.  Deep  ones  don’t  have  a  Spot  Hidden  skill 
listed; the Keeper decides that the creature’s skill would 
be below 50%, and so Harvey must make a Stealth roll 
at Regular difficulty level. The Keeper awards Harvey 
two  bonus  dice  since  he  had  a  good  lead  and  there 
are  plenty  of  hiding  places.  Harvey’s  player  rolls  45, 
65,  and  75—all  failures.  Harvey  hears  the  deep  one 
entering the building and bursts out of his cover, only 
to  find  himself  trapped,  about  to  be  attacked  by  the 
deep one!

Another  Example:  Amy  has  a  good  lead  on  her 
pursuers and seeks to hide her car by driving into an 
underground parking garage. Amy has 60% Drive Auto 
and 40% Stealth. Her pursuer is only just out of sight 
and  might  catch  a  glimpse  of  Amy’s  car  entering  the 
garage, so the Keeper sets the difficulty level to Regular. 
Amy rolls 47, a Regular success for Drive Auto but not 
for Stealth; her pursuers spot her entering the garage!

Passengers
Passengers do not make a speed roll and do not have move-
ment actions. They may act once on their turn in the DEX 
order.  Typically,  vehicle  passengers  might  use  firearms  or 
throw things out of the car to obstruct those following. 

One  passenger  can  assist  the  driver  with  navigation, 
reading maps, and offering advice on how to negotiate haz-
ards. If a passenger uses their action to assist the driver in 
this way they may make one Spot Hidden or Navigate skill 
roll. If successful, on the vehicle’s next move, the vehicle can 
accelerate  once  with  1  fewer  penalty  die  (see  Pedal to the 
Metal, page 139). Thus, the vehicle might advance up to 3 
locations with no penalty die, or up to 5 with 1 penalty die.

Ranged Attacks During a Chase
Firearms can be used during a chase: If a character on foot 
stops for a moment, he or she may use a firearm as normal. 
The options are as for one combat round of gunfire (i.e. one 
shot with a rifle, up to three shots with a handgun, etc.) This 
option costs 1 movement action, but no movement is made.
If a character is continuing to race (on foot or in a vehi-
cle), any firearms attack rolls are made with one additional 
penalty  die.  Taking  shots  in  this  manner  does  not  affect  a 
character’s performance in the chase. The options for firing 
are otherwise the same as for one combat round. This op-
tion does not cost any additional movement actions.

Vehicle tires may be targeted with gunfire: apply an addi-
tional penalty die to target tires due to their small size. Tires 
have an armor value of 3 and are only damaged by impaling 
weapons. If a tire takes 2 points of damage, it bursts. A burst 
tire reduces a vehicle’s build by 1 point.

The Keeper should judge the ranges for firearms. Both 
driver  and  passengers  gain  protection  from  a  vehicle’s  ar-
mor. The amount of armor is listed on Table V: Vehicles.

Driver Damage
If the driver of a moving vehicle suffers a major wound and 
remains conscious, he or she may still lose control of their 
vehicle and must roll immediately as for a Hazard at Hard 
difficulty level. A driver who falls unconscious due to a ma-
jor wound automatically loses control of the vehicle.

A  passenger  in  another  vehicle  fires  a  handgun  at 
Harvey. A Regular success is rolled for the firearms at-
tack. 1D10 damage is rolled, resulting in 10 damage. 
Harvey’s vehicle armor reduces this by 2, so Harvey 
takes 8 hit points damage. This is a major wound for 
Harvey,  who  wins  a  CON  roll  to  remain  conscious. 
He must now make a Drive Auto roll to keep control 
of  his  vehicle.  He  fails  the  roll.  The  Keeper  refers  to 
Table VI: Vehicular Collisions and chooses “moder-
ate incident” (it being a Hard difficulty level hazard), 
rolling 1 (1D6) point of build damage and a loss of 3 
(1D3) movement actions. This also results in 2 (1D6) 
hit  points  damage  for  Harvey.  The  Keeper  describes 
the  outcome;  Harvey  loses  control  of  his  car,  which 
glances off the side of an oncoming car, sending Har-
vey’s car spinning out of control. It takes him a while 
to  recover  control  and  rejoin  the  chase.  His  location 
remains unaltered.

Dealing with a Location in an  
Alternative Way
A  character  may  choose  to  interact  with  a  location  in  an 
alternative or unexpected way. For example, if a location is 
described  as “an  empty  residential  street,”  the  assumption 
may be that the quarry will run down it. Instead of this, they 
might decide to run to the nearest door and attempt to open 
it (by force if need be). If it fits the story then go with it. 

Characters Joining a Chase in Progress
Any  characters  who  join  an  ongoing  chase  should  make  a 
speed roll to determine their MOV rate. The Keeper should 
then position them on an appropriate location. 

A character who joins a chase as a pursuer needs a MOV 
rate that is at least equal to the slowest fleeing character. If 
they fail to achieve this, they can be ignored.

If a character joining a chase as a fleeing character has a 
MOV rate that is slower than the previously slowest member of 
the chase, some adjustment is required: the number of move-
ment actions that everyone in the chase has should be recal-
culated. Every character gets one movement action by default, 
plus one movement action for each point by which their MOV 
rate exceeds that of the new slowest participant in the chase. 

There  is  no  need  to  recalculate  speeds  or  movement 

actions when a character leaves a chase. 

142 

Call of CthulhuA Hunting Horror chases two cars on a mountain road.

Switching Between Modes of Movement 
There  are  a  variety  of  modes  of  movement  in  the  game. 
Some  creatures  have  alternate  speeds  listed  for  flying  or 
swimming. If no alternate MOV rating is listed, the Keeper 
may allow the character to use half of their standard MOV, 
providing the mode of movement is one that the character 
can perform. Thus a human with MOV 8 would have MOV 
4 when swimming, but would not have a MOV rating for 
flying. 

When characters change between modes of movement 
that continue to use their own physical body for propulsion, 
a fresh speed roll is not required. Simply adjust their MOV 
accordingly, remembering that they may be at either +1 or 
-1, depending on whether they achieved an Extreme success 
on or failed their speed roll (CON) at the start of the chase 
(see Establishing the Chase, page 132).

Characters  that  switch  from  being  on  foot  (or  other 
self-propelled mode) to driving a car should make a fresh speed 
roll using Drive Auto skill. When a character becomes a pedes-
trian, he or she should make a fresh speed roll using CON. 

If the character’s speed (MOV) is changed, their number 
of movement actions should be altered. Refer to Characters 
Joining a Chase in Progress (see page 142).

Characters Creating Hazards
Investigators,  monsters  and  non-player  characters  may 
create hazards or barriers through their actions during play. 
Doing  so  will  usually  require  the  expenditure  of  a  move-
ment action (for the time required), a skill roll (to achieve 
it) or both. The following ideas are examples of what might 
be  attempted,  and  the  Keeper  should  judge  each  situation 
on its own merits.

G  Pausing to secure a door with a bolt or key would 

cost 1 movement action but no skill roll.

G  Pausing  to  secure  a  door  using  Locksmith  skill 
would require a whole chase round and a successful 
skill roll.

G  Moving  a  heavy  wardrobe  against  a  door  would 

require a STR roll and a movement action.

G  Upending  a  fruit  stall  to  cause  a  delay  might  only 

cost 1 movement action.

G  Firing a gun to cause a crowd to panic would require 
a Luck roll. If failed, the action causes more trouble 
than it is worth. If successful, the crowd presents a 
hazard for those following.

143 

chapter 7: chasesG  Yelling, “Stop that man, he’s a thief,” at bystanders, 
hoping they might assist, would call for a Fast Talk 
or Intimidate skill roll.

Harvey is on the run in the streets of New York. To reach 
the next location he must push through a crowd, which 
presents  a  hazard.  If  he  fails  his  DEX  roll  to  weave 
through the crowd, the Keeper rules that Harvey will 
be  slowed  for  1D3  movement  actions.  Harvey  would 
only  take  damage  if  he  fumbled  the  roll;  perhaps  his 
desperate pushing would annoy someone so much they 
punch  him.  However,  thinking  fast,  Harvey  pulls  his 
pistol and fires into the air. The Keeper asks for a Luck 
roll,  which  Harvey  fails.  The  Keeper  decides  that  the 
crowd scatters and there is no longer a hazard. Howev-
er a nearby police officer is now after Harvey too!

Players  may  also  take  equally  creative  approaches  to 

negotiating hazards. 

Splitting Up
Characters in a chase may choose to take different routes. If 
so, you now have an additional chase to track. 

Monsters in a Chase
The majority of monsters and animals act the same way as 
people in a chase. Some have abilities that may exempt them 
from certain skill rolls; for example, those that fly would not 
need to make Jump or Climb rolls. 

Many monsters, animals, and non-player characters will 
lack listed values for the various skills that might be called 
upon in a chase (Jump, Swim, Drive Auto, etc.) In such cases 
the Keeper should use the following as a guide:

G  Where the monster or non-player character has an 
implied aptitude, use their DEX in place of the skill.
G  Where the monster or non-player character has an 
implied  ineptitude,  use  one-fifth  of  their  DEX  in 
place of the skill (or simply rule the attempt to be an 
automatic failure).

G  Where  the  monster  or  non-player  character  has 
neither implied aptitude nor ineptitude, use half of 
their DEX in place of the skill.

If  other  skills  are  required,  the  Keeper  might  use  a 
similar approach, using what he or she feels to be the most 
appropriate characteristic. For example, should you wish to 
determine the Spot Hidden skill of a particular monster (for 
whom there is no listed Spot Hidden skill), INT might be 
judged most appropriate; use either its full INT, half of its 
INT  or  one-fifth  of  its  INT  depending  on  how  perceptive 
you feel the monster to be.

"Somebody! Help me!"

Gnoph-keh  are  somewhat  like  giant  polar  bears  and 
so would probably be great swimmers—allow them a 
Swim skill equal to their DEX. You may feel that ghouls 
would make poor swimmers, in which case you might 
allow them a Swim skill equal to one-fifth of their DEX.

Fleeing the Scene
You may have a scene in which you wish to gauge how far 
the investigators manage to flee in a limited time. The chase 
rules can be used for this, counting the number of locations 
moved within a specified number of rounds. 

Vehicular Collisions
When a skill roll to negotiate a hazard is failed, the Keeper 
must consider the cause and the likely damage, and rate it 
against the left-hand column on Table VI: Vehicular Colli-
sions. If unsure, simply use the defaults of “minor incident” 
for  a  Regular  difficulty  level  hazard,  “moderate  incident” 
for  a  Hard  difficulty  level  hazard,  or “severe  incident”  for 
Extreme difficulty level hazards. 

The damage should also be rolled for each occupant of 
a vehicle involved in a collision, substituting “hit points” in 
place of “build”. Thus, a car that is in a moderate incident 
suffers  1D6  build  damage  and  each  occupant  of  the  car 
suffers 1D6 hit points of damage.

Most collisions should also result in a delay as the vehicle 

skids or loses speed (costing 1D3 movement actions).

Key
MOV:  A  rating  of  the  vehicle’s  speed  and  maneuverability 
in  chases.  These  ratings  are  for  modern  vehicles  and  may  be 
reduced by around 20% for 1920s vehicles (though there were 
cars in the 1920s that could exceed 100 MPH). 

Build: A rating of the strength and size of the vehicle. When 
reduced  to  zero,  the  vehicle  is  out  of  action.  Each  full  10  hit 
points of damage decreases a vehicle’s build by 1 point (round 
down); damage below 10 hit points is ignored.

If  a  vehicle’s  build  is  reduced  to  half  (round  down)  of  its 
starting value or lower, it is impaired; one penalty die is applied 
to all Drive Auto (or appropriate skill) rolls.

If a vehicle takes damage equal to its full build value in one 
incident,  the  vehicle  is  completely  wrecked  in  an  impressive 
manner. It may explode, burn, roll or suffer some combination 
thereof. All occupants of the vehicle are likely to die. Whether or 
not investigators have a chance of survival is up to the Keeper: 
Luck rolls may be allowed. Those who are fortunate get thrown 
free, though it is recommended they take at least 2D10 damage. 
If a vehicle’s build is otherwise reduced to zero by cumu-
lative  damage  (i.e.  in  increments  of  less  than  the  vehicle’s 
starting build value), it becomes undrivable, grinding to a halt. 
Depending on the situation (and perhaps a Luck roll) this may 
lead to an accident resulting in 1D10 damage for the driver and 
each passenger. 

Armor for people: The armor rating is for the passengers and 
driver,  reflecting  the  number  of  points  of  armor  the  vehicle 
provides against external attacks.

Passengers and crew: The number of people that can be ac-
commodated.

145 

chapter 7: chasesHarvey  lights  the  fuse  on  a  stick  of  dynamite  then 
flees from the cave before it explodes. The fuse is long 
enough for a minimum of 7 rounds of movement. At 
the end of the seventh chase round, and each round 
thereafter, a Luck roll is called for—if it is failed, the 
dynamite explodes. The Keeper gives Harvey 1 move-
ment action per round. During each chase round, the 
player  may  make  a  skill  roll  to  negotiate  a  hazard 
(scramble over wet rocks in an underground stream, 
climb a rope, and squeeze through the exit hole). 

When the dynamite explodes, the Keeper uses the 
range to attribute damage. The base range of dyna-
mite  is  3  yards  (see  Weapons  Lists,  page  401-405); 
however, the Keeper decides that this should be dou-
bled because of the enclosed environment. The Keeper 
places a location every 6 yards, noting 1, 2, and 3 on 
the map to mark the three range increments; at range 
1 the damage will be 4D10, at range 2 it will be 2D10 
and at range 3 it will be 1D10. Once out of the exit 
Harvey will be safe. So long as Harvey does not fail 
his skill rolls when negotiating the hazards, he should 
be able to make it out safely.

Hazards:

Stealing a car might attract unwanted attention.

On the first round Harvey fails his DEX roll and 
slips in the stream, taking 2 (1D3) points of damage 
and losing 3 (1D3) movement actions as he fumbles 
to regain his footing. He has 3 movement actions left 
before the Keeper starts asking for Luck rolls to deter-
mine if the dynamite explodes. Things are not looking 
so good for him now…

Chases in the Air and Sea
Chases  can  take  place  in  any  environment,  and  the  Keeper 
should  create  new  hazards  and  barriers  appropriately.  For 
example, at sea: rocks, shallows, buoys, waves, strong winds, 
etc. Or, for example, in the air: clouds, tall buildings, birds, 
cables, anti-aircraft fire, etc.

MOV Rates
The MOV rate is used as a measure of relative speeds. One 
point of MOV is significant in a chase; it allows for one addi-
tional movement action, and for this reason, the scale of MOV 
rating to speed is not linear. Each point of MOV equates with 
an approximate increase in speed of around 50%. 

The  MOV  rating  of  a  creature  is  not  necessarily  their 
maximum  speed  over  a  short  distance,  but  is  intended  to 
represent their overall speed in a chase. For example, a world 
class sprinter can achieve MOV 11 over 100 meters, but 12 

MPH  (MOV  9)  would  be  a  more  realistic  speed  for  a  fit 
human over distance, equating to a 5-minute mile.

Chases with Multiple Characters
When running a chase with multiple characters, the only sig-
nificant difference lies in the initial phase; see Establishing the 
Chase (page 132).

First,  decide  who  is  chasing  whom  and  whether  the 
fleeing characters are staying together or splitting up. If they 
split up there will be multiple chases and each chase should 
be tracked and resolved separately.

Each  character  involved  in  a  chase  makes  a  speed  roll 
(using either Drive Auto or CON) to establish their MOV 
rate  for  the  chase  (see  Speed  roll,  page  132).  Once  this  is 
done, list the participants of the chase in speed order in their 
two groups: pursuers and fleeing characters.
Next, eliminate those not in the chase:
Any  fleeing  characters  who  are  faster  than  their  fastest 

pursuer may escape the chase entirely if they wish to.

Any  pursuers  who  are  slower  than  the  slowest  fleeing 
character are left behind, and do not participate in the case.
The  two  groups  are  now  positioned  in  order  of  their 

MOV ratings.

146 

Call of Cthulhu1. Place the pursuers: Start with the slowest 
pursuer, right at the back of the chase. Then 
place each of the other pursuers a number 
of  locations  ahead  of  him  or  her,  equal  to 
their  difference  in  MOV  speeds.  Once  all 
of  the  pursuers  are  placed,  move  onto  the 
fleeing characters.

2.  Place  the  fleeing  characters:  As  with  a 
one-on-one  chase,  position  a  fleeing  char-
acter  (the  slowest  one)  2  locations  ahead 
of  the  foremost  pursuer.  Then  place  each 
of the other fleeing characters a number of 
locations ahead of slowest fleeing character, 
equal to their difference in MOV speeds.

3.  Position  hazards:  Note  down  any  haz-
ards, barriers, or other landmarks.

4.  Movement  actions:  Determine  how 
many movement actions each character has.

5. Determine DEX order: List participants 
in DEX order, fastest to slowest.

chapter 7: chasesBrian, Scott and Harvey are sitting drinking in their apartment one evening, when three cultists turn up at their door. 
The three investigators decide to flee via the window, knowing the door will not hold the cultists back for long. The Keeper 
establishes whether the investigators are all traveling in the same direction or splitting up; the players decide to head in 
the same direction. There will only be one chase.

The Keeper asks for a speed roll (CON) roll for each character. The investigators have to climb out of the window, 
while the cultists are delayed with breaking the door down. Both sides have an impediment, so neither side is given a 
bonus or penalty die for the speed roll.

Harvey (MOV 6): fails the CON roll: MOV 5 (6-1).
Brian (MOV 8): passes the CON roll: MOV 8.
Scott (MOV 9): passes the CON roll with an Extreme success: MOV 10 (9+1).
Cultist A (MOV 8): fails the CON roll: MOV 7 (8-1).
Cultist B (MOV 8): fails the CON roll: MOV 7 (8-1).
Cultist C (MOV 8): passes the CON roll with an Extreme success: MOV 9 (8+1).

Scott has a higher speed than any of his pursuers and escapes (unless he decides to hang around to help his buddies).
Brian and Harvey are heading in the same direction as Scott, but as their speed does not exceed that of the cultists, 

they may be caught. Thus, the chase is on!
Pursuing cultists in speed order:
Cultist A (7), Cultist B (7), Cultist C (9)

Fleeing investigators in speed order:
Harvey (5), Brian (8), Scott (10).

1. Place the pursuers: The Keeper begins by noting the slowest pursuers (Cultists A and B), are at the back of the chase, 
while 2 locations in front of them is Cultist C (speed 9 – speed 7 = a gap of 2 locations).
2. Place the fleeing characters: The gap between the fastest pursuer (Cultist C) and the slowest quarry (Harvey) is set to 
the default of 2 locations. Brian’s speed is 3 more than Harvey’s, so he begins 3 locations ahead of Harvey (unless Brian 
chooses to hang back to help his friend).

CultistA

3. Position hazards: The Keeper sets up the chase with the investigators having fled their apartment though the window, 
now being pursued down an alleyway.

window

CultistA
CultistB

The illustration shows the Keeper’s record of the chase. The Keeper notes only the characters, hazards and barriers.

Cultist A and B stand at the window, about to climb out.
Cultist C has gone through the window and is now in the yard behind Harvey. 
Harvey (H) is in the backyard, about to climb the fence.
Brian (B) is out in front, in the alleyway, having scaled the fence already.

4. Movement actions: Harvey has 1 movement action and is the slowest character in the chase. Cultists A and B both 
get 3 movement actions (1 default, plus 2 more for having MOV speeds of 2 more than Harvey). Brian gets 4 movement 
actions (1 default, plus 3 more for having a MOV speed of 3 more than Harvey). Cultist C gets 5 movement actions (1 
default, plus 4 more for having a MOV speed of 4 more than Harvey).
5. DEX order: Brian has the highest DEX, followed by Harvey, then the cultists. The Keeper is using the same statistics for 
each of the cultists; since they all have the same DEX, it does not matter what order they act in.
Round 1:

Notice how the Keeper has “cut to the chase” (see page 133). Brian, the lead cultist, and Harvey were not required to 
make rolls for climbing out of the window, and Brian is already over the fence. These things are simply allowed to have 
occurred as a result of the speed roll.

148 

Call of CthulhuBrian’s turn:
Brian moves first, running 4 spaces up the alley. The Keeper allows for all four spaces to be open locations; the Keeper 

is quite happy to have one investigator trapped, abandoned by his friends!

Harvey’s turn:
Harvey has to climb over the fence (barrier). Knowing the cultists are close behind, he leaps at it heedless of any 
danger. This costs him his only movement action. His Climb skill roll is a failure. Since the Keeper has ruled that the fence 
is a barrier and since Harvey failed his Climb roll, he has not crossed the fence and does not move on. His turn ends. The 
Keeper does not apply any damage for failing to climb the fence—the fact that cultists are about to attack him is sufficient. 
If Harvey wishes to climb over the fence, he must make another attempt next round.

Cultist C’s turn:
Using two of his actions, Cultist C runs across to Harvey and spends a third movement action to attack him (see Part 

4: Conflict, page 138).

At present, part way through round 1, the Keeper’s map looks like this:

window

fence

CultistA
CultistB

Harvey
Cultist C

Brian

Harvey is struggling to climb the fence when he is attacked by cultist C, and decides to kick out (fight back) at the 
cultist. The cultist attempts a fighting maneuver to grab hold of Harvey and pull him off of the fence. The cultist’s build 
is 0, the same as Harvey’s, so no bonus or penalty dice are awarded for the fighting maneuver.

59 is rolled for Harvey—a Failure.
20 is rolled for the cultist—a Regular success.
The cultist pulls Harvey from the fence, choosing to throw him back one location, into the middle of the yard. The 
cultist has made an attack and cannot initiate another attack this round, even though he has 2 movement actions re-
maining. He uses his fourth movement action to move back to Harvey. Cultist C still has 1 movement action left, but does 
not wish to move further, and his turn ends.

Cultist B’s turn: 
It is now the turn of Cultist B, who requires a skill roll to climb down from the window (one story) to the backyard. 
Cultist B, seeing Harvey lying vulnerable in the yard, takes a reckless approach, jumping from the window rather than 
climbing. The Keeper decides the difficulty level of the climb roll would be Regular, but raises this to Hard difficulty level 
for a jump. The Keeper rolls a failure for the cultist’s Jump skill. Referring to Table III: Other Forms of Damage, the 
Keeper chooses 1D10 damage as it was an especially dangerous tactic; the Keeper describes how the cultist lands badly, 
falling short of Harvey. This action also cost the cultist 1 (1D3) additional movement action, so he has now used 2 of his 
movement actions. He uses his third movement action to advance 1 location towards Harvey, and his turn ends.

Cultist A’s turn:
Seeing his friend land badly in the yard outside, Cultist A decides to take a cautious approach (see Hazards, page 134) 
to the climb, spending an additional movement action to gain a bonus die on the Climb roll. He passes the Climb roll and 
uses his third movement action to advance forward 1 location.
At the end of round 1 the Keeper’s map looks like this:

window

fence

CultistA
CultistB

Harvey
Cultist C

Brian

Things do not look good for Harvey. The Keeper rules that Brian has escaped. Harvey is trapped in combat with the 

cultists. The cultists are likely to overpower Harvey and take him captive.

chapter 7: chases150 

Call of CthulhuAn Example from "The Call of Cthulhu"
In  Lovecraft’s  story,  Cthulhu  is  temporarily  thwarted  as 
Johansen  reverses  the  Alert  into  him.  Could  this  be  done 
with the Call of Cthulhu game rules? Let’s put Johansen in 
the role of an investigator, and decide the boat is Build 22 
and a MOV of 11 (as for a battleship). Cthulhu has Build 22 
and a MOV of 14 (swimming). Both Cthulhu and Johansen 
make their speed rolls and both roll an Extreme success. The 
boat has a MOV of 12, Cthulhu has a MOV of 15. Cthulhu 
acts first in the DEX order and has 4 movement actions each 
round. Johansen goes second with 1 movement action. Let’s 
give Johansen a Pilot (Boat) skill of 70%. Cthulhu’s Fighting 
skill is 100%.

Cthulhu’s turn: Cthulhu uses 2 movement actions to catch 
up  with  the  Alert. With  his  third  movement  action  he  at-
tempts to sink the ship. Johansen responds by fighting back, 
and  wishes  to  use  a  fighting  maneuver.  His  goal  is  to, “To 
drive Cthulhu back long enough for me to escape”.  

The Keeper rolls 34 for his Fighting skill—a Hard suc-
cess  for  Great  Cthulhu  as  he  attempts  to  wreck  the  ship. 
The  player  rolls  14—an  Extreme  success  for  Johansen’s 
Pilot  Ship  skill.  Johansen  wins.  The  Keeper  considers  the 
outcome; the aim was to set the enemy back to provide time 
for escape. The Keeper forgoes the damage roll, but rolls 3 
(1D3) for number of movement actions that Cthulhu loses. 
The Keeper describes how Cthulhu appears to burst, releas-
ing an unspeakable stench as of a thousand opened graves. 
Cthulhu is pushed back 1 location, and his final movement 
action this round and his first two next round are lost as a 
result of Johansen’s fighting maneuver.

Johansen’s turn: Johansen has only 1 movement action and 
applies  full-steam  ahead,  accelerating  forward  through  5 
locations with his one movement action. The Keeper does 
not place any hazards in his way and Johansen is now 6 lo-
cations ahead. As he flees, Johansen looks over his shoulder 
to see Cthulhu nebulously recombining far behind the ship! 
Cthulhu cannot catch him next round and the Keeper rules 
that Johansen has escaped.

Johansen used his steamboat to ram Cthulhu and escape from the Great Old One.

151 

chapter 7: chasesnvestigators begin the game sane and rational. 
During  their  investigations  they  will  encoun-
ter  otherworldly  horrors,  alien  creatures,  and 
the  terrible  cosmic  truths  of  the  Cthulhu 
Mythos—all of which will challenge their state 
of mind and sense of normality, and push them 
to very edge of sanity. In some cases, the experience will be 
too  much  and  the  unfortunate  investigator  will  descend 
into  periods  of  temporary,  indefinite,  or  even  permanent 
madness.

Each investigator has Sanity points that can rise and fall 
during play. Sanity is used to determine whether the inves-
tigator  can  withstand  the  horrors  of  the  Cthulhu  Mythos, 
as  well  as  stand  up  to  fear-inducing  situations  without 
turning  tail  and  running  away.  Loss  of  Sanity  points  can 
lead to insanity. When Sanity points are reduced to zero, an 
investigator is permanently and incurably insane, and ceases 
to be a player character.

Sanity in the game is modeled after the behavior of pro-
tagonists  in  H.P.  Lovecraft’s  fiction  who,  more  often  than 
not, faint or go mad when confronted with mind-bending 
physics and monstrous entities from beyond space and time. 
Sanity  is  the  game’s  register  of  the  investigator’s  flexibility 
and  resilience  to  emotional  trauma.  Characters  that  start 
with  a  high  number  of  Sanity  points  find  it  easier  to  ra-
tionalize traumatic events or to repress horrific memories. 
Those  with  a  lower  number  of  Sanity  points  are  mentally 
fragile and more susceptible to emotional upset. While the 
cosmic  horror  of  the  Cthulhu  Mythos  is  the  fundamental 
assault on the mind of an investigator, other gruesome and 
comparatively  ordinary  sights  and  events  can  also  cause 
emotional disturbance.

In an unnerving or horrifying situation the Keeper will 
test the resiliency and emotional strength of the investiga-
tors.  This  is  done  by  calling  for  a  Sanity  roll  for  each  in-
vestigator entangled in the situation. Investigator insanity is 
triggered when too many Sanity points are lost in too short 
a time, causing temporary or indefinite insanity. 

Sanity Points and SAN 
Rolls
Sanity points should be tracked carefully, as the number can 
change up and down throughout the game. When investi-
gators encounter a sanity-threatening situation, the Keeper 
may  call  for  a  Sanity  roll.  Each  player  whose  investigator 
experiences this source of horror rolls 1D100. A success is 
a roll equal to or less than the investigator’s current Sanity 
points. Bonus dice and penalty dice are not applied to Sanity 
rolls (with one exception, Self-Help, page 167). 

Note: If using the optional rule for spending Luck points, 

these may not be spent on Sanity rolls.

A successful roll means that the investigator loses no Sanity 
points, or only a minimal amount. A failed Sanity roll always 
means  the  investigator  loses  Sanity  points.  The  amount  lost 
depends on the spell, book, entity, or situation encountered. 

The Mythos is anathema to the human mind.

In published Call of Cthulhu scenarios, Sanity loss rolls 
are shown as two numbers or rolls separated by a slash, for 
instance: SAN 1/1D4+1. The number to the left of the slash 
is the number of Sanity points lost if the Sanity roll succeeds. 
The die roll to the right of the slash is the number of Sanity 
points lost if the Sanity roll is failed. Sometimes this may be 
written  as  SAN  0/1D4;  in  this  particular  case,  a  successful 
Sanity roll means no Sanity points are lost, but if the roll is 
failed, the investigator loses 1D4 Sanity points.

Failing  a  Sanity  roll  always  causes  the  investigator  to 
lose self-control for a moment, at which point the Keeper 
should  choose  an  involuntary  action  for  the  investigator. 
For example:

T  Jump  in  fright—causing  the  investigator  to  drop 
something (spectacles, flashlight, gun, book, etc.)
T  Cry out in terror—drawing attention, saying some-

thing inappropriate.

T  Involuntary  movement—swerving  the  steering 
wheel  dangerously  to  one  side,  throwing  up  one’s 
hands in horror, cringing.

T  Involuntary combat action—if a Sanity roll is failed 
during  a  combat  round,  the  investigator’s  action 
for  that  round  may  be  dictated  by  the  Keeper;  for 
example, lashing out with a fist, squeezing a trigger, 
taking shelter behind someone else.

T  Freeze—stare disbelievingly for a moment but take 

no action.

A fumbled Sanity roll results in the character losing the 
maximum  Sanity  points  for  that  particular  situation  or 
encounter.

154 

Call of CthulhuLosing more than a few Sanity points at one time may 

cause an investigator to go insane, as described later.

When  encountering  one  ghoul,  the  Sanity  point  loss  is 
0/1D6. It is the same when encountering multiple ghouls; the 
sanity effect is for the encounter rather than each ghoul seen. 

Harvey Walters follows a trail into a crypt, where he 
finds a ghoul feasting on forbidden fruits among the 
coffins. The Keeper calls for a Sanity roll. Harvey has 
45 Sanity points and his player rolls 83—a failed roll. 
The  Keeper  describes  Harvey’s  involuntary  gasp  of 
horror. The player picks up 1D6, rolls a 4, and reduces 
Harvey’s Sanity points by 4 points (45–4 = 41 Sanity 
points remaining).

Maximum Sanity

The threat of insanity in Call of Cthulhu characterizes the 
Cthulhu  Mythos  in  a  way  that  allows  no  compromise. 
Exposed to it, few sane humans freely choose the Mythos, 
for the Mythos is intrinsically loathsome and foul. The con-
nection  of  Sanity  points  and  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  points 
emphasizes  the  power  of  the  Mythos,  which  corrupts  and 
ruins by proximity and association. 

An investigator’s Sanity points may rise and fall during 
play;  however,  they  may  never  rise  above  the  character’s 
maximum Sanity rating. Each investigator has a maximum 
Sanity  point  value  that  begins  at  99.  Knowledge  of  the 
Cthulhu Mythos always lowers an investigator’s maximum 
Sanity  points.  Maximum  Sanity  points  equal  99  minus 
current Cthulhu Mythos points (99–Cthulhu Mythos skill). 
When  gaining  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  points,  the  player 
should decrease the investigator’s maximum Sanity by the 
same amount.

Harvey  Walters  spends  some  time  perusing  ancient 
tomes, gaining 3% Cthulhu Mythos skill. His player 
adds 3 points to Harvey’s Cthulhu Mythos skill and 
decreases his maximum Sanity from 99 to 96.

Insanity 

From that point forward my impressions are scarcely to be 
relied on—indeed, I still possess a final, desperate hope that 
they all form parts of some daemonic dream or illusion born 
of delirium. A fever raged in my brain, and everything came 
to me through a kind of haze—sometimes only intermittently.
—H.P. Lovecraft, The Shadow Out of Time

In Call of Cthulhu, insanity is induced by traumatic experi-
ences and the ghastly comprehension that connects to the 
Cthulhu Mythos. The duration of the insane state depends 
upon the number or proportion of Sanity points lost. 

Three states of insanity can result: temporary, indefinite, 

and permanent.

Regardless of whether the insanity is temporary or in-

definite, it will consist of three distinct game phases:

First: the insanity begins with a brief “bout of madness,” during 
which the player’s control of their investigator is compromised 
(see Insanity Phase 1: A Bout of Madness, page 156). 

Second:  the  bout  of  madness  is  followed  by  a  period  of 
underlying  insanity,  during  which  the  player  retains  full 
control  of  their  investigator;  however,  the  investigator  is 
prone to delusions, phobias, and further bouts of madness 
(see Insanity Phase 2: Underlying Insanity, page 158). 

Third: the final phase is recovery (see Treatment and Re-
covery from Insanity, page 164).

Temporary Insanity 
If an investigator loses 5 or more Sanity points as the result 
of  one  Sanity  roll,  sufficient  emotional  trauma  has  been 
suffered that the Keeper must test the investigator’s sanity. 
The Keeper asks for an Intelligence (INT) roll. If the roll is

chapter 8: sanityfailed, the investigator has repressed the memory (a trick the 
mind  uses  to  protect  itself),  and  does  not  become  insane. 
Perversely, if the INT roll succeeds, the investigator recog-
nizes the full significance of what has been seen or experi-
enced and goes temporarily insane. The effects of temporary 
insanity begin immediately and last for 1D10 hours.

Indefinite Insanity 
On  losing  a  fifth  or  more  of  current  Sanity  points  in  one 
game “day,” the investigator becomes indefinitely insane. No 
investigator is simply able to shrug off this amount of san-
ity drain. A “day” in this instance is defined by the Keeper, 
usually lasting until the investigator reaches a place of safety 
in  which  they  can  rest  and  recover  their  wits.  Depending 
on the situation, it may mean surviving until dawn, sitting 
down for a nice cup of tea, or having a good night’s sleep. In-
definite insanity lasts until the character is cured or recovers 
(see Recovery from Indefinite Insanity, page 164).

Permanent Insanity 
When Sanity points are reduced to zero the investigator is 
permanently and incurably insane and ceases to be a player 
character. In the real world, all insanity is indefinite insanity, 
since  no  one  in  real  life  can  hope  to  predict  the  future  as 
accurately as a Call of Cthulhu Keeper can. 

Many  disorders,  especially  congenital  conditions,  offer 
little hope of recovery. Lovecraft concludes more than one 
story with the intimation that a lifetime of madness for the 
narrator will follow. 

Every  Keeper  must  work  out  what  the  end-point  of 
madness is in the game. Now and then a quiet release might 
be made from a local asylum. Some thin, unnaturally pallid 
person, almost unrecognizable after soul-wracking terrors, 
can  walk  shyly  into  downtown Arkham  or  elsewhere,  cast 
keen eyes about, and attempt to regain some semblance of 
his or her former life—however, no player should count on 
such privilege as a right. 

The Effects of Insanity
St John is a mangled corpse; I alone know why, and such is 
my knowledge that I am about to blow out my brains for fear 
I shall be mangled in the same way. Down unlit and illimit-
able corridors of eldritch phantasy sweeps the black, shapeless 
Nemesis that drives me to self-annihilation.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Hound

Both temporary and indefinite insanity take the investigator 
through two distinct phases of insanity. First, the investiga-
tor experiences a short bout of madness (phase one). This 
is then followed by a longer period of underlying insanity 
(phase two), which lasts until the investigator has fully re-
covered (hours in the case of temporary insanity, months in 
the case of indefinite insanity).

Insanity Phase 1: A Bout of Madness
Also known as “the red mist,” “frenzy,” “freak out,”  
and “panic attack.”
On becoming insane, the investigator experiences a bout of 
madness. While experiencing a bout of madness, the inves-
tigator loses all self-control. In game terms this means that 
control of the investigator is handed from the player to the 
Keeper (for a short amount of real-world time). It is up to 
the Keeper whether this control takes the form of dictating 
specific actions or if it means giving the player guidelines on 
how to play out the madness for however long it may last.

On the upside, the investigator cannot lose further San-
ity points while experiencing a bout of madness. The mind 
is  completely  unhinged  at  this  point  and  any  subsequent 
horrors are either forgotten or later believed to be a man-
ifestation  of  the  madness.  This  protection  is  limited—the 
bout  of  madness  lasts  1D10  combat  rounds  (real  time)  if 
being played out, but may be longer, in which case the bout 
is summarized by the Keeper.

Each time an investigator suffers a bout of madness, the 
Keeper may amend one of the investigator’s backstory en-
tries or add a new one. These alterations serve two purposes. 
The first is to reflect the investigator’s descent into madness 
by  adding  irrational  entries  or  corrupting  existing  ones. 
Second, entries can be added or altered to reflect events in 
the  story  and  thus  tie  the  investigator  into  the  plot  more 
strongly. The player and Keeper should work together to add 
or revise backstory entries appropriately.

Personal  Description:  Suitable  entries  might  include 
“Wild-eyed,” “Thousand-yard stare,” “World-weary,” or “No 
longer cares for their own appearance”.

Coming to after a Bout of Madness should be disorienting.

156 

Call of CthulhuIdeology/Beliefs: A balanced entry such as “religious” might 
be changed to something more extreme or deranged, such as 
“Unbelievers must be converted or made to suffer”. Alterna-
tively, a new entry that is appropriate to the situation might 
be made, such as “Obsessed with defeating the Cthulhu cult”.

Significant People: A  new  name  might  be  added  together 
with a reason for its inclusion. For example, “Can’t rest until 
Delbert Smith is in his grave,” or “Robin Poole is the incar-
nation of Ganesh.”

Meaningful Locations: The present location might take on 
great significance, or the investigator might become fixated 
on reaching another location for either 
irrational  reasons.  The 
rational  or 
former might be the cult temple in the 
jungle; the latter might be an overpow-
ering desire to visit Graceland.

A Bout of Madness—Real Time
If  the  bout  of  madness  happens  during  a  scene  in  which 
other investigators are present, the bout of madness lasts for 
1D10 combat rounds (note that this is not the full duration 
of the state of insanity—which is 1D10 hours for temporary 
insanity or longer for indefinite insanity). 

The option to play out the bout of madness round-by-
round may be used even when the investigator is alone, or if 
the Keeper thinks it appropriate.

To determine the nature of the bout of madness, either 
roll  on  Table  VII:  Bouts  of  Madness—Real  Time,  or  the 
Keeper may choose an appropriate option.

Treasured  Possessions:  It  is  easy  to 
lose  possessions  while  one’s  mind  is 
disrupted  by  insanity.  Any  possessions 
might be erased or noted as lost. A new 
possession might be acquired and given 
great significance.

Traits:  A  trait  might  be  erased  or  al-
tered  to  something  more  suitable;  for 
example:  “bully,”  “drug  addict,”  “easily 
distracted,” “talks  too  loudly,” “lack  of 
inhibitions.”

Injuries & Scars: These are more usu-
ally altered as a result of major wounds. 

Phobias and Manias: These may result 
from rolls during the bout of madness.

Arcane  Tomes,  Spells  and  Artifacts: 
Such  items  might  be  lost  or  destroyed 
in a fit of pique. The investigator might 
involuntarily  cast  any  spells  that  they 
know, activate artifacts, or study a tome 
that they had previously shunned.

Encounters  with  Strange  Entities: 
Encounters  with  a  monster  or  deities 
should  be  recorded  here  regardless  of 
whether  insanity  results  or  not.  This 
also provides a good place to record the 
amount  of  Sanity  points  lost  to  a  par-
ticular type of entity (see Getting Used 
to the Awfulness, page 169).

A bout of madness can take one of 
two forms depending on the situation, 
either in real time (round-by-round) or 
in summary.

Table VII: 
Bouts of Madness— 
Real Time (roll 1D10):
1)  Amnesia:  The  investigator  has  no  memory  of  events  that  have 
taken place since they were last in a place of safety. For example, it 
seems to them that one moment they were eating breakfast and the 
next they are facing a monster. This lasts for 1D10 rounds.

2)  Psychosomatic  disability:  The  investigator  suffers  psychosomatic 
blindness, deafness, or loss of the use of a limb or limbs for 1D10 rounds.

3) Violence: A red mist descends on the investigator and they ex-
plode in a spree of uncontrolled violence and destruction directed at 
their surroundings, allies or foes alike for 1D10 rounds. 

4) Paranoia: The investigator suffers severe paranoia for 1D10 rounds; 
everyone is out to get them; no one can be trusted; they are being spied 
on; someone has betrayed them; what they are seeing is a trick.

5) Significant Person: Review the investigator’s backstory entry for 
Significant  People.  The  investigator  mistakes  another  person  in  the 
scene for their Significant Person. Consider the nature of the relation-
ship; the investigator acts upon it. This lasts 1D10 rounds. 

6) Faint: The investigator faints. They recover after 1D10 rounds.

7)  Flee  in  panic:  The  investigator  is  compelled  to  get  as  far  away  as 
possible by whatever means are available, even if it means taking the only 
vehicle and leaving everyone else behind. They travel for 1D10 rounds.

8)  Physical  hysterics  or  emotional  outburst:  The  investigator  is 
incapacitated from laughing, crying, screaming, etc. for 1D10 rounds.

9) Phobia: Investigator gains a new phobia. Roll 1D100 on Table IX: Sam-
ple Phobias, or the Keeper may choose one. Even if the source of the phobia 
is not present, the investigator imagines it is there for the next 1D10 rounds.

10) Mania: The investigator gains a new mania. Roll 1D100 on Table 
X: Sample Manias, or the Keeper may choose one. The investigator 
seeks to indulge in their new mania for the next 1D10 rounds.

157 

chapter 8: sanityHarvey is investigating an office at night. Opening a 
locked cabinet, he finds a metal canister. As he touches 
it a metallic voice speaks to him—the voice of a recent-
ly deceased friend. The player fails a Sanity roll, and 
Harvey loses 6 points of Sanity. The Keeper asks for an 
Intelligence (INT) roll, which Harvey’s player makes 
successfully—Harvey  has  realized  what  this  means! 
Harvey becomes temporarily insane, beginning a bout 
of madness. As Harvey is alone, the Keeper opts for the 
“summary option” and rolls 4, which indicates some 
form  of  violence.  The  Keeper  decides  that  Harvey 
trashes  the  room  in  his  search  for  hidden  cameras, 
listening devices, and speaker units. The Keeper then 
describes  the  scene  to  the  player, “When  you  recover 
your  wits,  at  least  3  hours  have  passed.  You  find 
yourself  with  the  contents  of  the  office  looking  like  a 
bomb has hit it. There’s a guy lying on the floor with 
a  bloody  wound  on  his  head,  and  he’s  either  dead 
or  unconscious.”  (This  is  a  non-player  character—a 
security guard—that the Keeper has thrown in). “The 
canister is full of bullet holes, and you’re holding the 
smoking barrel of a gun to your own temple.”

Another example: The investigators have retired 
for  the  evening,  each  one  to  their  own  hotel  room. 
Late  that  night  one  of  the  investigators,  Kratos,  is 
haunted by a spectral figure. Kratos fails his Sanity roll 
and loses 5 Sanity points. His player then rolls 23 on 
1D100,  passing  his  Intelligence  roll  (INT).  Kratos  is 
temporarily insane. Kratos is alone, so the Keeper rolls 
1D10  on  Table  VIII:  Bouts  of  Madness—Summary, 
with a result of 6, which indicates Significant People. 
His backstory states that Kratos is in love with a young 
woman by the name of Alice. At present, Kratos is in 
Paris, while Alice is back in London. The Keeper de-
cides that Kratos will flee the hotel and head for the 
train station, boarding the first train for Calais. The 
other investigators might hear Kratos leaving and are 
allowed a Listen roll to do so. One of them succeeds, 
hears Kratos slamming his bedroom door and follows 
him (this would be a good opportunity to use the chase 
rules). The Keeper hands control of Kratos back to the 
player and tells him what Kratos’s bout of madness is 
driving him to do, leaving the rest to the player.

Insanity Phase 2: Underlying Insanity
Once  the  initial  bout  of  madness  is  over,  the  investigator 
enters a lower-level state of underlying insanity. Control of 
the investigator is placed firmly in the hands of the player, 
who may freely choose how to roleplay being insane. While 
the  player  is  not  compelled  to  do  so,  aspects  of  the  initial 
bout of madness might be reincorporated for the duration 
of the underlying insanity. 

While  in  the  fragile  state  of  underlying  insanity  (after 
the initial bout of madness has passed) any further loss of 
Sanity  points  (even  a  single  point)  will  result  in  another 
bout of madness. This mental fragility remains for the full 

Fleeing in panic during a Bout of Madness.

A Bout of Madness—Summary
If the bout of madness happens away from the company of 
other investigators, or if all the investigators present suffer 
a  bout  of  madness  simultaneously,  the  Keeper  can  simply 
fast-forward  the  action  and  describe  the  outcome.  The 
Keeper may describe the crazy things that the investigator 
has done, or simply say where the investigator finds him or 
herself when the bout of madness comes to an end. In this 
way the investigator may be lost in madness and thus not 
under  the  player’s  control  for  minutes  or  hours  (typically 
1D10 hours, or as the Keeper judges appropriate). Note that 
these minutes or hours are not played out; they are simply 
summarized  by  the  Keeper.  The  Keeper  may  just  describe 
the  unfamiliar  place  in  which  the  investigator  returns  to 
their  senses  with  no  memory  of  where  they  have  been  or 
what they have done.

Most of the outcomes require the investigator to leave the 
place where the onset of insanity occurs. If this is not possible 
the  Keeper  should  adapt  the  outcome  accordingly.  If  there 
is  a  chance  that  another  investigator  might  hear  or  see  the 
insane investigator leaving, they should be given a chance to 
intervene. If the insane investigator is confronted by another 
investigator before their bout of madness is over, the Keeper 
should hand control of the investigator back to the player at 
that moment and allow the players to roleplay the scene. This 
may mean that the intended outcome is cut short.

To determine the nature of the bout of madness, either 
roll  on  Table  VIII:  Bouts  of  Madness—Summary  or  the 
Keeper may choose an appropriate option.

158 

Call of Cthulhuduration of the insanity—1D10 hours in the 
case of temporary insanity—and probably for 
the duration of the scenario or chapter of the 
campaign in the case of indefinite insanity.

It is important to note that the investigator, 
while  insane,  may  act  completely  rationally 
and normally, only outwardly presenting their 
insanity  during  bouts  of  madness.  Further 
advice on roleplaying insane characters is pro-
vided  in  Chapter  10:  Playing  the  Game  (see 
Failed Sanity Rolls, page 209).

Having  recovered  from  his  bout  of 
madness,  Harvey  rejoins  his  friends. 
Harvey’s  player  now  has  full  control 
over  Harvey  and  decides  to  play  up 
Harvey’s paranoia, constantly checking 
the street for cars and disassembling the 
telephone, looking for bugs.

Insanity Side-Effects 1:     
Phobias and Manias

You ask me to explain why I am  
afraid of a draught of cool air

—H.P. Lovecraft, Cool Air

While  the  investigator  is  sane,  a  phobia  or 
mania acts solely as a roleplaying trait. For ex-
ample, if the player wishes for his or her (sane) 
investigator  to  overcome  claustrophobia  and 
crawl through dark tunnels, the phobia won’t 
prevent this. However, while the same investi-
gator is insane, the phobia or mania takes on a 
greater significance. 

Phobic and Manic Responses 
While Insane
Direct exposure (close physical proximity) to 
the subject of the phobia causes panic; equally, 
exposure  to  the  source  of  a  mania  causes  an 
obsessive reaction. 

For  phobias,  actions  other  than  fighting 
or fleeing may only be made with one penalty 
die. This penalty does not apply to Sanity rolls 
or reality check rolls.

While  in  a  state  of  underlying  insanity 
(see  following),  being  exposed  to  the  subject 
of  their  mania  will  cause  an  overwhelming 
response  in  the  investigator.  If  the  Keeper 
prompts the player towards some form of be-
havior  appropriate  to  their  mania,  the  inves-
tigator  will  suffer  one  penalty  die  on  all  dice 
rolls  until  the  obsession  has  been  indulged 
in  some  manner,  or  the  investigator  is  well 

Table VIII : 
Bouts of Madness—Summary  
(roll 1D10):

1) Amnesia: The investigator comes to their senses in some unfamil-
iar place with no memory of who they are. Their memories will slowly 
return to them over time.

2) Robbed: The investigator comes to their senses 1D10 hours later, 
having been robbed. They are unharmed. If they were carrying a Trea-
sured Possession (see investigator backstory), make a Luck roll to 
see if it was stolen. Everything else of value is automatically missing.

3) Battered: The investigator comes to their senses 1D10 hours later 
to find themselves battered and bruised. Hit points are reduced to half 
of what they were before going insane, though this does not cause 
a Major wound. They have not been robbed. How the damage was 
sustained is up to the Keeper.

4)  Violence:  The  investigator  explodes  in  a  spree  of  violence  and 
destruction. When the investigator comes to their senses, their ac-
tions may or may not be apparent or remembered. Who or what the 
investigator has inflicted violence upon and whether they have killed 
or simply inflicted harm is up to the Keeper.

5)  Ideology/Beliefs:  Review  the  investigator’s  backstory  entry  for 
Ideology  and  Beliefs.  The  investigator  manifests  one  of  these  in  an 
extreme, crazed, and demonstrative manner. For example, a religious 
person might be found later, preaching the gospel loudly on the subway.

6) Significant People: Consult the investigator’s backstory entry for 
Significant People and why the relationship is so important. In the time 
that passes (1D10 hours or more) the investigator has done their best 
to get close to that person and act upon their relationship in some way.

7)  Institutionalized:  The  investigator  comes  to  their  senses  in  a 
psychiatric ward or police cell. They may slowly recall the events that 
led them there.

8) Flee in panic: When the investigator comes to their senses they are 
far away, perhaps lost in the wilderness or on a train or long-distance bus.

9) Phobia: The investigator gains a new phobia. Roll 1D100 on Table 
IX: Sample Phobias, or the Keeper may choose one. The investigator 
comes to their senses 1D10 hours later, having taken every precaution 
to avoid their new phobia.

10) Mania: The investigator gains a new mania. Roll 1D100 on Table 
X: Sample Manias, or the Keeper may choose one. The investigator 
comes to their senses 1D10 hours later. During this bout of madness, 
the  investigator  will  have  been  fully  indulging  in  their  new  mania. 
Whether this is apparent to other people is up to the Keeper and player.

chapter 8: sanityout of range of the stimulus. For example, while in a place 
that serves alcohol, a dipsomaniac would take one penalty 
die on all rolls unless taking a drink. Of course characters 
who fully succumb to their drug craving will be subject to 
the drug’s  effects,  such as drunkenness  or altered states of 
consciousness. In such situations the Keeper may alter the 
level of difficulty of certain skill rolls (or impose a penalty 
die on opposed skill rolls) depending on the situation and 
state of the character.

Successful use of the Psychoanalysis skill upon an insane 
investigator  enables  the  insane  investigator  to  temporarily 
ignore a phobia or mania (see Chapter 4: Skills).

Harvey has developed Selenophobia (fear of the moon). 
On exiting a theater with friends, the sight of the moon 
gives him a chill. Harvey is sane at present. His player 
describes  Harvey’s  nervous  disposition  and  his  relief 
when he arrives home and closes the curtains. 

A  week  later,  Harvey,  now  suffering  underlying 
insanity,  finds  himself  in  a  similar  situation  and 
chooses to flee home to safety. On his way home, Har-
vey is followed by a sinister-looking individual. The 
Keeper offers a Spot Hidden roll to Harvey’s player to 
determine if Harvey notices his pursuer. Since this roll 
has nothing to do with either fighting or fleeing, and 
Harvey is still exposed to the source of his phobia, one 
penalty  die  is  applied  to  his  Spot  Hidden  roll.  Only 
when Harvey is safely in doors and the moon is out of 
sight will this penalty cease.

Insanity Side-Effects 2: Delusions 
and Reality Checks
Where does madness leave off and reality begin? Is it possible 
that even my latest fear is sheer delusion? 

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Shadow Over Innsmouth

While not in control of the investigator’s actions, the Keeper 
is free to present an investigator suffering underlying insan-
ity  with  delusional  sensory  information  at  any  time.  The 
only way for the player to be sure of what his or her insane 
investigator is seeing, hearing, touching, feeling or smelling 
is to make a “Reality Check”. 

Delusions  have  greater  impact  when  they  have  some 
relevance to the investigator. A great way to do this is to refer 
to the investigator’s backstory and use some aspect as inspi-
ration for delusions. An investigator’s late spouse calling on 
the  telephone  is  much  more  engaging  than  random  delu-
sions. Delusions can also make great consequences when a 
player of an investigator suffering underlying insanity fails 
a Pushed skill roll.

Reality Check Rolls
While  reality  checks  are  only  usually  called  for  on  behalf 
of  insane  investigators,  a  player  might  call  for  one  if  they 
wish to “see through” what they believe to be a hallucination 
or illusion. To perform a reality check, the player makes a 
Sanity roll:

A threat of the Mythos or just a nice old lady?

162 

Call of CthulhuFailure: lose 1 Sanity point. This will immediately induce a 
bout of madness if the investigator is suffering underlying 
insanity. Any delusions are not dispelled. 

Success: the investigator sees through any delusions, and 
the Keeper must describe what the investigator genuinely 
perceives.

On making a successful reality check roll, the investiga-
tor should see things as they really are and will be resistant 
to delusions until losing further Sanity points (thus pre-
venting the Keeper from constantly throwing delusions at 
a player). 

Successful use of the Psychoanalysis skill will allow an 

insane investigator to see a delusion for what it is.

Harvey,  still  suffering  from  underlying  insanity, 
returns to his home. Going out of his back door, he 
finds his neighbor leaning over the garden fence with 
some kind of recording device in his hand, pointed 
at Harvey’s house. The Keeper tells Harvey’s player 
that  Harvey’s  neighbor  is  spying  on  him.  This  is 
a  delusion—in  fact  the  neighbor  is  doing  no  such 
thing.  The  player,  wondering  if  this  is  a  delusion, 
asks for a reality check.

With  a  successful  reality  check  roll,  Harvey  is 
free of his delusion. The Keeper cannot continue the 
delusion  and  must  describe  the  scene  realistically. 
In this case, there was no recording device and the 
neighbor was simply admiring Harvey’s lawn.

If the player chooses to make a reality check roll 
and fails, Harvey will lose 1 Sanity point and suffer 
a  bout  of  madness.  As  he  is  the  only  investigator 
present, the Keeper is free to fast-forward to the point 
where another investigator (or the police) turns up 
to  find  Harvey  coming  out  of  his  own  front  door, 
armed with a shotgun, determined to break into his 
neighbor’s house and interrogate him, or worse.

If the player does not choose to ask for a reality 
check,  the  Keeper  is  free  to  elaborate  on  the  delu-
sion, perhaps stating that Harvey sees his neighbor 
conversing  with  a  ghoul  (actually  the  neighbor’s 
child) on the patio. At this point the player would 
have to either make a Sanity roll for seeing a ghoul 
or  make  a  reality  check  roll.  If  she  succeeds  in  the 
reality check, Harvey will realize there is no ghoul 
and that he was imagining it all. If she fails, Harvey 
will lose a point of Sanity, suffer a bout of madness, 
and terrible things will no doubt ensue.

 Phobia
When exposed to the source of their phobia, or even just 
thinking about it, a character’s symptoms can develop rap-
idly. Within seconds, palpitations, trembling, choking, and 
an uncontrollable anxiety appear. The character feels that 
they must do everything possible to avoid the situation.

Mania
A character with a mania will have a fairly constant euphor-
ic or possibly irritable mood. Symptoms include a general 
increase  in  activity,  garrulousness,  increased  self-esteem 
to  the  point  of  delusion,  decreased  need  for  sleep,  easily 
distracted,  willingness  for  dangerous  or  imprudent  activi-
ties such as reckless driving, hallucinations, delusions, and 
bizarre behavior. 

Compulsion
Compulsions tend to be ritual actions performed to affect 
the future, possibly to prevent some vague  notion of im-
pending doom. Though the character may agree the actions 
are senseless, the need to perform them is overpowering. 
Even in times of great stress, the character may ignore his 
or her survival in order to perform the ritual. 

Amnesia
An  inability  to  recall  important  personal  information, 
brought on by a desire to avoid unpleasant memories. The 
character  may  just  forget  the  bad  experience  that  caused 
the amnesia or they could forget major chunks of time, or 
even everything about themselves. The Keeper may choose 
to reset Cthulhu Mythos to 0 and maximum Sanity to 99 
while  the  amnesia  holds  sway;  the  horror  returns  when 
the  character’s  memories  do,  or  when  they  experience  a 
similarly horrific situation.

Insanity Side-Effects 3: Insanity and 
the Cthulhu Mythos 

What I have seen cannot be true, and I know that this mad-
ness of my own will at most lead only to suffocation when my 
air is gone. The light in the temple is a sheer delusion, and 
I shall die calmly like a German, in the black and forgotten 
depths. This demoniac laughter which I hear as I write comes 
only from my own weakening brain.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Temple

Insanity bought on by non-Mythos stimuli yields no Cthul-
hu Mythos knowledge. However, each time an investigator 
reels  from  Mythos-induced  trauma  (e.g.  seeing  a  Mythos 

163 

chapter 8: sanitymonster, reading a Mythos tome, being affected by a Mythos 
spell), he or she learns more of the Mythos, and this is re-
flected  in  the  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill.  The  first  instance  of 
Mythos-related insanity always adds 5 points to the Cthulhu 
Mythos skill. Further episodes of Mythos-induced insanity 
(temporary or indefinite) each add 1 point to the skill. 

Harvey Walters finds a manuscript in Crowninshield 
Manor. After comprehending it, he has 3% Cthulhu 
Mythos skill but lost no Sanity points. When he steps 
outside,  Harvey  sees  a  nightgaunt  fly  overhead.  He 
goes  insane,  his  mind  quailing  before  the  unearthly 
manifestation. Since this is Harvey’s first Mythos-re-
lated  insanity,  his  player  must  add  5  percentiles  to 
Harvey’s Cthulhu Mythos skill, raising it to 8%. Har-
vey’s maximum Sanity points drops to 91 (99 minus 
8 Cthulhu Mythos skill).

A Note about Delusions  
and Sanity Point Loss
The  delusion  of  a  sanity-threatening  entity  (e.g.  a 
monster) may cause an investigator the same potential 
Sanity  point  loss  as  the  real  thing.  The  player  has  a 
choice: either accept what is seen as “real” and make 
the appropriate Sanity roll for seeing that monster, or 
make a reality check roll. If the player makes a success-
ful reality check roll and dispels the delusion, no Sanity 
roll needs to be made—there was no monster after all, 
perhaps  just  a  tramp  who  appeared  to  be  a  monster 
in the eyes of the insane investigator. However, if the 
player fails the reality check roll, the insane investigator 
loses one Sanity point and enters a bout of madness. 

Note  that  while  suffering  a  bout  of  madness  the 
investigator is immune to further Sanity point loss and 
need not make a Sanity roll for seeing the monster. If 
the monster (delusion or not) is still present at the end 
of  the  bout  of  madness,  the  player  will  then  have  to 
make the appropriate Sanity roll for seeing the monster.

Treatment and 
Recovery from Insanity

Temporary insanity ends quickly enough that schedules of 
treatment  are  not  realistic.  On  the  other  hand,  treatment 
of  permanent  insanity  mostly  has  no  meaning,  since  by 
definition  the  character  will  never  recover,  no  matter  how 
good the facility (the character should be retired from play). 
Only  indefinite  insanity  offers  real  scope  for  intervention 
and treatment.

Recovery from  
Temporary Insanity
Temporary  insanity  lasts  1D10  hours.  Alternatively,  the 
investigator will recover after a good night’s sleep in a safe 
place.  If  the  investigators  are  in  a  state  of  heightened  ten-
sion  (for  example,  standing  watch  at  night  due  to  fear  of 
imminent attack), the Keeper may deem that sanity cannot 
be recovered.

Recovery from 
Indefinite Insanity
After  each  month  of  treatment  of  an  indefinitely  insane 
character, safe from further trauma, the player makes a dice 
roll. Two sorts of care might help to get the character to this 
point: private care or institutionalization. In choosing, the 
Keeper and player should consider the character’s resources, 
friends and relatives, and past behavior.

Alternatively,  at  the  Keeper’s  discretion,  indefinite  in-
sanity lasts until the next Investigator Development Phase 
at the end of the present game chapter (in a campaign) or 
scenario.

Private Care
The best care available is at home or in some friendly place 
where nursing can be tender, considerate, and where there 
are no distractions (such as other patients). Analysis and/or 
psychiatric medications may be available.

To  determine  the  success  of  treatment  with  private/

home care, roll 1D100:

A  result  of  01–95  is  a  success:  add  1D3  Sanity  points  for 
psychiatric medications or psychoanalysis. This is followed 
by a Sanity roll for the investigator; if the roll is successful, 
the investigator is cured of their insanity; if the roll is unsuc-
cessful then a further Sanity roll may be attempted in one 
month’s time.

If the result is 96–100:  the  character  rebels  against  taking 
the  drugs  or  therapy.  1D6  Sanity  points  are  lost  and  no 
further progress can be made during the next game month.

164 

Call of CthulhuSanity Loss
The  following  is  a  guide  for  how  the  loss  of  San-
ity points might be characterized and can be used to 
complement and add color to the other rules described 
in this chapter (note that the effects may accumulate).
1—2  points:  discomfort  and  unease,  something 
gnawing at the corner of the mind—hardly noticeable, 
yet definitely there.
3—4 points: disgust, or the feeling that something is 
wrong  here.  This  may  manifest  in  vomiting,  momen-
tary stupefaction, or shivering.
5—9 points: fear, panic, or disorientation—enough to 
cause a potential episode of temporary insanity. This 
represents  a  major  shock  leading  to  uncontrollable 
physical reactions (violent body ticks, extreme nausea, 
etc.)  and/or  disassociation  with  surroundings  and 
people.
10—19  points:  mind-warping  horror—hair  changes 
to white, violent physical reaction (to self and/or oth-
ers), physical and mental shutdown, sudden character 
change (temporary), raving and delusions, or propen-
sity to either violence or total fear.
20+ points: ultimate cosmic evil—beyond humanity’s 
ability  to  comprehend.  The  mind  is  broken  and  will 
take a long time to return to sanity, and even if a way 
can be found, the person will never be the same again. 
Results in certain indefinite insanity.

*50 is an average rating. The Keeper may determine that 
the standard of an institution is above or below average, and so 
raise or lower this value within the range of 5 to 95.

Commitment to an Asylum 
Investigators may want to stay at an asylum or sanitarium, 
perhaps to gather information, hide from someone, or even 
to receive treatment. They should have little trouble enter-
ing if they can pay for the care. A private institution with an 
available room will accept someone without symptoms who 
merely wishes a rest and counseling. All institutions ask for 
references, however.

A  medical  practitioner  licensed  within  the  state  can 
arrange  that  an  investigator  be  held  for  psychiatric  obser-
vation for up to 72 hours. If evidence of serious disorder is 
gathered, the patient may be placed in an asylum for a lon-
ger  period,  for  purposes  of  observation  and  evaluation  as 
spelled out by law. Then the court will discharge or commit 
for treatment depending on the asylum’s report.

Those  committed  for  treatment  are  subject  to  review, 
but they may be in an institution for many years. It requires 

"Bahaha! A three-lobed burning eye! Ahahaha!"

Institutionalization
The next best care is committal to an insane asylum. Asy-
lums may be said to have an advantage over home care in 
that they are relatively cheap, or even a free service pro-
vided by the state. These institutions are of uneven quality 
and some may be potentially harmful. Some are creative 
places of experiment and advanced therapy, while others 
merely offer rude confinement. 

Supervised activity, manual therapy, psychiatric med-
ications, and hydrotherapy are frequent, as is electrocon-
vulsive  treatment  (dependent  on  the  period  within  which 
your game is set). 

Psychoanalysis is unlikely to be available. Sometimes an 
institution may convey an uncaring sense that undermines 
the  useful  effects  of  psychiatric  medications,  leaving  the 
investigator with a sense of anger and loss, and likely to be 
distrustful of outpatient support once he or she has left the 
institution.

To determine the success of treatment within an institu-

tion, roll 1D100:

A result of 01–50* is a success: add 1D3 Sanity points for 
psychiatric medications and/or therapy. This is followed by 
a Sanity roll, if the Sanity roll is successful, the investigator 
is cured of their insanity; if the roll is unsuccessful then a 
further Sanity roll may be attempted in one month’s time.

If the result is 51–95: no progress has been made.

If the result is 96–100:  the  character  rebels  against  taking 
the  drugs  or  therapy.  1D6  Sanity  points  are  lost,  and  no 
progress can be made during the next game month.

chapter 8: sanityArrested  after  breaking  into  a  construction  site 
and  attempting  to  steal  dynamite,  Harvey  Walters 
continually babbles about saving the world from the 
Cthulhu cult and the forces of the Mythos, especially 
the  evil  wizard  Carl  Stanford.  The  court  decides  to 
have Harvey assessed by a local psychiatrist. Dr. Shiny 
listens  carefully  during  an  interview  then  decides  to 
make Harvey an involuntary patient. 

Dr. Shiny lists his reasons: (1) Harvey poses a risk 
to others, especially Carl Stanford; (2) Harvey poses 
a danger to himself, having stolen the dynamite and 
blasting caps; and (3) Harvey has a psychiatric disor-
der, in the form of delusions concerning cultists and 
the Cthulhu Mythos. 

While  taking  Harvey’s  history,  Dr.  Shiny  learns 
that recently Harvey has been in five car accidents in-
volving chases, as well as one hit-and-run. Of the last, 
Harvey explains that he had to run over an evil cultist. 
Dr. Shiny therefore also declares Harvey unfit to drive. 
But  he  finds  that  Harvey  is  financially  competent, 
able to explain all his assets and how he earns money, 
and so Harvey retains the right to continue to manage 
his own financial affairs. Nonetheless, Harvey Walters 
is committed to the institute for assessment. 

 A few nights later, Harvey escapes from the insti-
tute and heads toward Arkham. Naturally Dr. Shiny 
wants to protect all involved, so he notifies the police. 
He also calls Carl Stanford regarding the escape. “Yes, 
Mr. Stanford, Harvey may be dangerous . . .”

another formal presentation to the court, in which an inves-
tigator would have to be found mentally incompetent to act 
on his or her own behalf, or else might voluntarily surrender 
specific legal rights in return for treatment. The soundness 
of  these  proceedings  can  vary  widely;  brusque  pro  forma 
evaluations  are  not  unusual,  and  much  depends  upon  the 
character and dedication of judge, counsel, and examining 
physician or physicians.

If the court decides for mental incompetence then a re-
sponsible guardian is chosen, who thereafter in theory acts 
to benefit the individual. Normally the guardian is a relative 
or someone whom the court has reason to assume will act 
in the individual’s best regard. Lacking other candidates, the 
court appoints itself.

Unless  the  investigator  is  criminally  insane  (in  which 
case  the  court  must  be  the  guardian),  the  guardian  now 
decides what is best for the investigator. This may indeed be 
commitment, but it might also be home care, or a therapeu-
tic sea voyage, etc. Lacking other indication, the court will 
accept any reasonable plan that seems to have the backing 
of medical opinion.

If the guardian commits the investigator to an institu-
tion, the guardian continues to have general authority over 
the  investigator,  assigning  day-to-day  care  and  authority 
with  the  sanitarium  staff.  Thereafter,  the  investigator  has 
three  ways  to  leave:  he  or  she  may  convince  the  guardian 
to remove him or her from the institution; he or she may 
convince the institution’s staff to bring notice of his or her 
restored mental balance before the awarding court and that 
court takes upon itself the guardianship  and grants his or 
her freedom; or he or she can simply climb over the institu-
tion’s wall and run for his or her life.

Mental Health  
Dangerousness Criteria 
When a person seems to be at risk of self-harm or for harm 
to others, and apparently cannot care for him- or herself, a 
medical  doctor  can  certify  that  the  individual  should  un-
dergo psychiatric assessment and/or become an involuntary 
patient.  With  this  affirmation,  often  of  a  comprehensive 
nature, the state can hold an individual for observation and 
potentially for treatment. The duration of institutionaliza-
tion varies by state, but the term is rarely less than 60 game 
days for a legal assessment, and frequently up to 180 days. 

This fate is most likely for an investigator who attempts 
bodily assault or murder without apparent motive, or who 
intelligently  shams  mental  disturbance  to  avoid  serious 
criminal charges. The doctor also can revoke the capacity to 
manage personal finances, the right to drive an automobile, 
the right to make treatment decisions, and so on.

Call of CthulhuIncreasing Current  
Sanity Points 
In addition to the care listed above, there are four ways to 
raise an investigator’s current Sanity points.

1.  Keeper  award:  at  the  end  of  a  successful  scenario  or 
campaign chapter, Keepers may specify dice rolls to increase 
investigators’  current  Sanity  points.  Keeper  award  rolls  are 
the  same  for  all  participants,  but  are  rolled  individually  by 
players. Such rewards should be proportional to the danger 
the group faced. However, if the investigators were cowardly, 
brutal, or murderous, the Keeper may opt to reduce or remove 
the reward, especially if they wish to enforce a moral agenda.

Harvey uses his knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos to 
defeat the ghouls, and his adventure ends. The Keeper 
gives a Sanity point reward of 1D6.

2. Increasing a Skill to 90%:  award 2D6 Sanity points when 
a character increases a skill to 90%. This reward represents 
the discipline and self-esteem gained in mastering a skill.

3.  Psychotherapy:  intensive  psychoanalysis  can  return 
Sanity points to an investigator patient. Make a 1D100 roll 
against the analyst or doctor’s Psychoanalysis skill once per 
month.  If  the  roll  succeeds,  the  patient  gains  1D3  Sanity 
points. If the roll fails, add no points. If the roll is fumbled 
then  the  patient  loses  1D6  Sanity  points,  and  treatment 

by  that  analyst  concludes—there  has  been  some  sort  of 
serious incident or dramatic setback in the therapy, and the 
relationship between patient and therapist has broken down 
beyond saving.

In the game, psychoanalysis alone does not speed recov-
ery from insanity; however, it can strengthen the investiga-
tor by increasing Sanity points, providing a larger reserve for 
the active days to come. Recovery is independent of Sanity 
points.  The  use  of  psychoanalysis  is  different  in  the  game 
world than in the real world. In the real world, psychoanal-
ysis will not work against the symptoms of schizophrenia, 
psychotic  disorders,  bipolar  disorders  (manic  depression) 
or  severe  depression.  Psychoanalysis  is  the  game’s  equiva-
lent of mental first aid and is a world removed from real-life 
medical care for mental illness. 

While in game terms, temporary and indefinite insanity 
can be cured, permanent insanity is impervious to psycho-
analysis. Participation is impossible when the investigator’s 
mind is in such disarray.

Therapy can also be used to remove a phobia or mania. 
At  the  end  of  a  month  the  analyst  rolls  for  success  in  the 
same manner as detailed above. If successful, the investiga-
tor then makes a Sanity roll. If both rolls are successful the 
phobia or mania is cured and erased from the investigator’s 
backstory.  This  benefit  replaces  the  Sanity  point  gain  and 
no  such  points  are  awarded.  Failure  of  either  of  the  rolls 
bestows no benefit. Fumbling either of the rolls results in a 
loss of 1D6 Sanity points (as above).

4. Self-help: an investigator may choose to spend time with 
one  entry  listed  in  their  backstory  which  could  act  as  a 
form of psychological support; clearly this does not include 

Seeing the shriveled body of a friend is likely to call for a Sanity roll.

167 

chapter 8: sanity168 

Call of Cthulhuphobias, manias, wounds or anything to do with the Cthul-
hu  Mythos.  This  may  be  done  during  downtime  between 
adventures or during the investigator development phase. 

The player should go into some detail about what their 
investigator is doing to seek healing or redemption. The ac-
tions should be thematically appropriate to their backstory; 
perhaps the investigator is going on a religious retreat or a 
holiday with a loved one. 

The player then makes a Sanity roll. Keeper and players are 
encouraged to roleplay the scene to the point where it comes to 
a head, and then make the Sanity roll, roleplaying the outcome. 
If the roll is successful, the investigator gains 1D6 Sanity points. 
If it is unsuccessful, 1 Sanity point is lost, and the Keeper and 
player should revise that aspect of the investigator’s backstory 
in  some  way  to  reflect  the  failure.  Thus  the  religious  retreat 
might result in a complete loss of religious faith, or a family 
holiday might result in separation or divorce. 

Each  investigator  begins  the  game  with  one  backstory 
entry that is especially important to them: this is their “key 
connection”. If the player chooses to use their investigator’s 
key connection, they are granted a bonus die when making 
their Sanity roll. In addition to the 1D6 Sanity points gained 
for a successful Sanity roll, the investigator will recover from 
any indefinite insanity. If the Sanity roll is failed, that aspect 
of the investigator’s backstory is revised, and that investiga-
tor no longer has a key connection. 

In time, the investigator may form a new key connection. 
During a future investigator development phase, a backsto-
ry aspect may be converted into a new key connection if the 
player successfully uses the “self-help” option to regain San-
ity points via that connection. Alternatively, any Sanity roll 
of 01 (critical success) allows for the immediate nomination 
of a new key connection to replace the one that was lost.

Note: Current Sanity points can never increase above an 
investigator’s maximum Sanity (99–Cthulhu Mythos skill). 

Getting Used to the  
Awfulness 
At some point, constant exposure to the same Mythos crea-
ture has no further effect—the monster is no longer a living 
nightmare, but rather another obstacle in the investigator’s 
path. Once an investigator has lost as many Sanity points for 
seeing a particular sort of monster as the maximum possible 
Sanity point loss for that monster, he or she should not lose 
more Sanity points for a reasonable interval. For instance, 
no  investigator  could  lose  more  than  6  Sanity  points  for 
encountering deep ones (0/1D6 SAN), even if a hundred of 
them were seen at once. 

But  be  warned!  Investigators  never  truly  get  used  to 
seeing  alien  obscenities.  After  a  time,  perhaps  once  the 
investigator’s  life  has  returned  to  some  form  of  normalcy, 
the sense of horror can rise up anew. A player should keep 
track of the Sanity points lost to any given Mythos entity. 
With  every  investigator  development  phase  (see  page  94), 
the player should reduce all those numbers by 1—time is a 
great healer.

Harvey has lost a total of 6 Sanity points as a result of 
encounters with deep ones. Harvey cannot lose more 
Sanity  points  through  seeing  deep  ones  at  present. 
However, when Harvey’s player makes her next set of 
experience rolls, she has to reduce that limit by 1 to 
5. Now if Harvey meets a deep one and fails his SAN 
roll, he will lose 1 point of SAN.

Optional Rules

Insane Insight
When  an  investigator  goes  insane  (either  temporarily  or 
indefinitely),  he  or  she  has  a  momentary  insane  insight. 
This moment of clarity provides a clue or action that might 
benefit  the  investigator(s)  immediately  or  at  some  later 
stage. The Keeper should determine an appropriate insight 
relevant to the plot of the scenario.

Mythos Hardened
When  an  investigator’s  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  rises  above 
the value of his or her Sanity score a turning point has been 
reached.  That  investigator’s  understanding  of  the  universe 
undergoes  a  paradigm  shift  that  results  in  a  permanent 
change to their personality and comprehension of their place 
in the cosmos. How this is portrayed is left open to the player. 
The player may decide that his or her investigator’s mind is 
inured to the horror, no longer cares, or has a more profound 
understanding  that  is  no  longer  shaken  by  the  truth.  From 
that point onward, all Sanity point loss is halved. Once this 
change  has  taken  place  it  is  permanent  and  will  not  revert 
if  the  investigator’s  Sanity  should  rise  above  their  Cthulhu 
Mythos knowledge.

Multiple Sanity rolls
The rules state that the Sanity point loss for a monster remains 
the  same  whether  one  monster  or  a  multiple  monsters  are 
encountered.  One  option  that  ramps  up  Sanity  point  loss  is 
to ask the player to roll Sanity loss once for each monster and 
then use the highest number rolled. This approach works well 
when  multiple  monsters  of  different  types  are  encountered 
simultaneously.

Harvey encounters 3 deep ones and Father Dagon all 
at once, and is required make one SAN roll. Harvey’s 
player  fails  the  SAN  roll  and  must  roll  for  Sanity 
point loss once for each monster. She rolls 1D6 once 
for each deep one, results in 2, 4 and 5. She also rolls 
1D10 for Dagon, resulting in 4. Harvey loses Sanity 
points equal to the highest value—5 points.

chapter 8: sanityhe  magic  of  the  Cthulhu  Mythos  stems  from 
the unfathomable alien intelligences that reside 
outside of humanity’s ability to comprehend. 
What may be the pinnacle of science can eas-
ily be interpreted as “magic” by the ignorant. 
What  is  certain  is  that  those  who  delve  into  such  matters 
rarely  come  away  unchanged—usually  for  the  worse!  Ma-
nipulating time and space is not a thing to be done lightly 
and there can be grave consequences for those investigators 
who dabble in things best left alone.

Mythos  magic  is  variable  and  was  not  tightly  defined 
by  H.P.  Lovecraft;  each  occurrence  of  magic  serves  a  par-
ticular story rather than fitting some consistent overarching 
structure.  However,  some  generalizations  can  be  made. 
Mythos magic is traditional in scope, centering on perilous 
summoning  of  horrible  entities  and  the  desperate  manip-
ulation  of  inimical  forces.  Spells  are  formally  constructed; 
one wrong word or gesture can disrupt the spell at best, or 
cause it to go horribly wrong at worst.  

Few Mythos spells can be performed quickly, with many 
requiring  exacting  conditions  as  well  as  lengthy  rites  and 
ceremonies. Each spell must be studied and learned, often 
requiring the investigator to spend long hours poring over 
cryptic manuscripts and ancient books of lore. Though rare 
for investigators, cultists and sorcerers may be taught spells 
by  their  fellows,  or  even  granted  magical  visions,  knowl-
edge,  and  spells  through  abhorrent  communion  with  the 
dark gods of the Cthulhu Mythos. Investigators wishing to 
find a fast track for learning spells are more likely to find a 
one-way ticket to an asylum, their minds broken and sanity 
destroyed. 

Spells must be approached warily, since often their costs 
and  effects  are  initially  unknown  to  the  spell-caster.  For 
investigators, Mythos magic can be a dangerous trap, for in 
using  it  investigators  lose  Sanity  points  and  gain  Cthulhu 
Mythos knowledge—becoming more like those whom they 
seek to defeat. Mythos magic bewilders, shocks, disorients, 
and  debilitates  its  human  practitioners.  Mankind  was  not 
meant to know such things, and with enough exposure the 
psychic and physical contradictions involved in using magic 
drive humans insane.

Investigators will mostly experience magic from outside 
sources, either by being the target or by witnessing the effect 
of  spells  cast  by  someone  else.  An  investigator  rarely  be-
comes a mage, since the requisite knowledge and experience 
usually leads to madness first.

Whether  investigators  gain  much  by  knowing  the 
magic of the Cthulhu Mythos, they often risk much when 
attempting to use it. Spells learned while playing published 
scenarios  may  prove  useful  only  in  the  course  of  a  single 
adventure.  Consequently,  though  all  players  are  invited  to 
study this chapter, it is only Keepers who will benefit most 
from  it  when  planning  adventures  and  creating  suitably 
objectionable adversaries.

In This Chapter
This chapter discusses spells and the books of the Cthulhu 
Mythos—how spells are learned and how they are cast, as 
well as looking at the dark knowledge contained within an-
cient tomes. It also discusses the occult versus the magical, 
and tells ways to increase the POW characteristic.

This chapter does not contain spells. Mythos spells can 

be found in Chapter 12: Grimoire. 

What is Magic?

Gilman had some terrible hints from the dreaded 
Necronomicon of Abdul Al-hazred…and the suppressed 
Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt to correlate with his 
abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of 
dimensions known and unknown.

 —H.P. Lovecraft, The Dreams in the Witch House

After World War  I,  astronomers  confirmed  that  the  thirty 
or forty thousand light years of easily observed stars nearest 
to us comprised only a minor corner of the universe. There 
was not one Milky Way, as astronomers had once believed, 
but rather thousands and millions of galaxies, most so faint 
and so distant that the truth of the nebulae had long been 
argued, but never before solved. The notion of island uni-
verses—galaxies,  as  we  now  say—was  a  bombshell.  In  the 
1920s, humanity’s perception of the unbounded universe’s 
true size increased by orders of magnitude.

Writing as such discoveries took place, Lovecraft gradu-
ally evolved a background myth incorporating such discov-
eries and added some flavorings from Einstein and Planck. 
These  new  “universes,”  so  he  appears  to  have  speculated, 
were truly islands—their separation included their natural 
laws. Isolated by hundreds of thousands or millions of light 
years, the stuff of life could differ wildly. Very quickly, these 
islands also took on a Riemannian association of existing in 
or being connected to other dimensions.

The magic of the Cthulhu Mythos is the unifying logic 
of  this  universe  of  universes.  Magic  works  everywhere.  It 
models  and  defines  the  greater  reality;  it  is  the  ultimate 
expression of natural law, the will of the Outer Gods made 
palpable and the arbiter of time, space, and matter.

In  comparison,  earthly  science  and  religion  seem  of 
little avail. Apparently we understand far less than we flatter 
ourselves as knowing. Is imperfection in what we believe or 
in how we have come to believe it? Perhaps there is a poverty 
in  our  souls  or  our  mathematical  equations  that  forestalls 
ultimate  knowledge  and  revelation.  The  Mythos  mocks 
human pretensions.

Call of CthulhuMythos Tomes
The open book lay flat between us, with the picture staring re-
pulsively upward. As the old man whispered the words "more 
the same" a tiny splattering impact was heard, and something 
showed on the yellowed paper of the upturned volume. I 
thought of the rain and of a leaky roof, but rain is not red.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Picture In The House

In Lovecraft’s stories, the protagonist usually learns Mythos 
magic  by  finding  and  following  written  instructions.  The 
volumes  of  arcane  lore  mentioned  by  the  Lovecraft  Circle 
of writers represent the intellectual invasion of the Cthul-
hu  Mythos.  In  particular,  these  ancient  manuscripts  and 
suppressed publications included recipes for the admission 
(or  return!)  of  the  Great  Old  Ones  and  the  Outer  Gods, 
as  described  in  vivid  detail  in  Lovecraft’s  classic  story  The 
Dunwich Horror. At least by implication, such writings also 
indicated how to force away or dispel those dreadful entities. 
It takes time to learn, even from textbooks that have been 
carefully written and specially laid out just for that purpose. 
Studying the crabbed, idiosyncratic, and infinitely more dif-
ficult Mythos books takes much more time and dedication. 
These musty, thick books are often clumsily scribed by men 
whose  sanity  has  long  since  been  erased  by  the  horror  of 
their  experiments,  trials,  and  conjectures.  The  present  day 
apparatus of scholarship does not exist in such books. There 
are no indices, no glossaries, no tables of contents, and no 
careful  definitions.  There  may  not  be  numbered  pages, 
chapters, paragraphs, punctuation, or even breaks between 
words. Some tomes might best be described as the ravings of 
mad men—yet to the seeker of dark knowledge, such texts 
hold wondrous insights and power.

Many manuscripts are not even in a known alphabet—
some  are  older  than  time,  in  languages  long  lost;  others 
are written in occult ciphers to stymie witch-finders or the 
Inquisition, and now must be cracked before the would-be 
reader can ponder the sinister truths they conceal.

Even if a sorcerer wrote for others who were familiar with 
the arcane and occult, the writing was for adepts and cultists, 
not  laypersons.  Strange  terms  and  ideas  would  be  written 
with no explanation. Valuable annotations might be made by 
a succession of owners, each perhaps in a different language 
or with a different aim, and some inscribed in error.

Many  Mythos  tomes  are  ancient  and  must  be  handled 
with care. Some are delicate and liable to crumble to dust if 
the reader doesn’t wear thin gloves and turn the pages with 
padded forceps. Some whisper that certain tomes are more 
than  merely  pages  bound  in  leather;  that  they  are  "living" 
things, intent on sowing their evil taint on the unwary and 
acting as direct conduits to the horrors of the Outer Gods. 

Only in the present does the technology exist with which 

to make quick and accurate copies.

An aspiring occult student attempts to cast a spell.

Reading Mythos Books
Opening  a  Mythos  tome  is  a  dangerous  business.  It  was 
written by someone who had experienced the Mythos and, 
if the reader is successful in understanding what is written, 
this  book  will  act  as  a  conduit  to  the  alien  horrors  of  the 
Cthulhu Mythos. Opening the cover of a tome might be lik-
ened to opening a door to a burning room. By opening this 
door the reader is exposed to the fire and may be scorched 
or  incinerated.  The  human  mind  is  metaphorically  burnt 
by the knowledge of the Mythos, the  very act  of trying  to 
comprehend the material causing the reader to suffer both 
mentally and physically. Some of the lesser tomes might only 
be a small fire, but others, such as the dread Necronomicon, 
are a raging inferno.

When an investigator gains access to a Mythos tome, the 
Keeper should describe the cover and look of the book. The 
reader can swiftly ascertain whether the tome is written in a 
language he or she understands. Refer to Language (other) 
skill  (page  66)  for  rules  on  recognizing  and  reading  other 
languages. A translator must be found if a book is written 
in  a  language  unknown  by  the  investigator.  The  Keeper 
should  decide  what  gets  translated,  how  quickly,  and  how 
accurately. If the language is unknown or long forgotten, the 
investigators must come up with a plan that convinces the 
Keeper, or else the book baffles them.

Initial Reading
The  next  step,  beyond  looking  at  the  cover,  reading  the 
title  (if  it  has  one  that  can  be  read),  and  determining  the 
language in which the book is written, is to make an initial 
reading. To continue the analogy used above, this is where 

173 

chapter 9: magicthe investigator is exposed to the fire within. An initial read-
ing can be swift and may represent the reader only having 
skimmed the book sufficient to gain some insight regarding 
its contents, or it may be a cover-to-cover reading. An initial 
reading  can  take  as  much  time  as  the  Keeper  wishes;  this 
may be minutes, hours, days, or weeks, depending on how 
the Keeper wants to shape the story. 

Whether a reading roll is called for is up to the Keeper, 
who may choose to grant automatic success to anyone with 
a modicum of skill in the appropriate language. 

To make a reading roll, the player makes an appropriate 
Language skill roll on 1D100. The Keeper decides on a dif-
ficulty level for reading the book based upon its age, form, 
and condition Table XI: Mythos Tomes, pages (237-239).

A  book  printed  within  the  last  century  and  in  good 

condition would be of Regular difficulty.

A handwritten work is likely to be of a Hard difficulty 

level, especially if it is old.

The most challenging of ancient, moldering tomes, con-
taining a mix of print and handwritten annotation, would 
be Extreme difficulty level.

If the investigator fails the reading roll, they perhaps gets 
some inkling as to the content of the book, but have failed 

Harvey gets his hands on the Book of Eibon…

Book of Eibon: Sanity point loss 2D4. Cthulhu 
Mythos  +3%/+8%,  Full  study  32  weeks.  Mythos 
rating 33%.

The Keeper judges Harvey’s reading of the book to 
be secondary to the plot and is in no rush for Harvey to 
complete an initial reading, making it clear to the play-
er that an initial reading is going to take a few days. 

Harvey  begins  reading  the  book  in  his  home 
and  then  continues  while  on  a  long  train  journey. 
The  Keeper  decides  that  Harvey  has  read  for  long 
enough to get something from the book and that the 
train journey would be a dramatic point to call for a 
reading roll. As the book is a flawed and incomplete 
translation, the reading roll is set to Hard difficulty 
level. Harvey’s player makes the roll and is rewarded 
with +3% Cthulhu Mythos knowledge (the Cthulhu 
Mythos  Initial—CMI  number  for  the  tome)  and 
reduces  Harvey’s  maximum  Sanity  points  by  a 
corresponding  amount.  The  player  is  also  informed 
of a number of spells contained within the book. She 
then  rolls  2D4  and  Harvey  loses  6  Sanity  points. 
This  is  more  that  the  five  points  required  to  trigger 
temporary  insanity,  should  Harvey’s  player  pass  an 
Intelligence roll, which she does. The Keeper decides 
that Harvey loses his mind and pulls the emergency 
stop cable, bails out of the train, and runs off into the 
night.  The  Keeper  withholds  that  information  and 
simply tells the player that Harvey awakens at dawn 
in a cornfield, his clothes muddy and torn. The Book 
of Eibon lies in tatters next to him, its pages scattered 
across the field. Harvey gains “Siderodromophobia—
Fear of trains, railroads, and train travel”. 

to comprehend it; no Sanity points are lost and no Cthul-
hu Mythos skill is gained. The player may ask to push the 
roll, but must justify doing so, perhaps staying up all night 
reading or using reference books as an aid to study. When 
thinking of consequences for failing a pushed reading roll, 
the Keeper should be creative and include Sanity point loss. 
If in no hurry, they may continue to read the book without 
pushing the roll. The timing of the next reading roll is at the 
Keeper’s discretion (perhaps once per week).

The Table XI: Mythos Tomes (pages 237-239) indicates 
the  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  points  and  Sanity  point  loss  for 
each tome. Each tome has two values for Cthulhu Mythos: 
CMI (Cthulhu Mythos Initial) showing how many Cthulhu 
Mythos skill points are given for an initial reading, and CMF 
(Cthulhu  Mythos  Full)  that  shows  how  many  points  are 
given for full study of the tome. 

Once  the  investigator  has  made  an  initial  reading,  the 
Keeper should reward them with the initial reading (CMI) 
number. The reader now automatically loses the Sanity cost 
of the tome (no Sanity roll is made)—non-believers do not 
take this Sanity loss (see Becoming a Believer, page 179).

As  well  as  gaining  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  and  losing 
Sanity  points,  the  initial  reading  also  allows  the  reader  to 
learn about the contents of book and gain some idea of what 
spells it might contain. The reader will also have a clear idea 
of how long it will take to complete a full study of the book 
(see following).

Full Study

He had himself read many of them—a Latin version of 
the abhorred Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis, 
the infamous Cultes des Goules of Comte d'Erlette, the 
Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and old Ludvig 
Prinn's hellish De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he 
had known merely by reputation or not at all—the Pnakotic 
Manuscripts, the Book of Dzyan, and a crumbling volume of 
wholly unidentifiable characters yet with certain symbols and 
diagrams shudderingly recognizable to the occult student.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Haunter of the Dark

A  full  study  of  a  Mythos  tome  indicates  a  comprehensive 
reading,  as  one  might  make  when  studying  an  academic 
work, or as a religious adherent might make of a sacred text. 
This  may  involve  repeated  readings,  comparative  reading, 
use of reference works, note taking, and so on. No reading 
roll is required; if any reading roll was required, it will have 
been made during the initial reading. 

Such a study can take many months. At the end of such 
a  course  of  study,  the  reader  must  make  a  roll  for  Sanity 
point loss appropriate for the tome (if a Believer, see page 
179). The tome’s Mythos rating is then compared with the 
reader’s Cthulhu Mythos knowledge. If the reader’s Cthulhu 
Mythos skill is below the Mythos rating of  the  book, they 
gain Cthulhu Mythos points equal to the full study (CMF) 
number.  If  the  reader’s  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  is  equal  to  or 
above  the  book’s  Mythos  rating,  they  only  receive  Cthulhu 

174 

Call of CthulhuMythos skill points equal to the initial reading (CMI) number 
of the book. 

Subsequent periods of full study may be undertaken, the 
difference being that each study will take twice as long as the 
previous  one  (double  all  reading  times).  Cthulhu  Mythos 
skill increase and Sanity point loss are applied in the same 
way. In this way a single volume may be studied repeatedly 
over  the  years,  but  each  time  taking  progressively  longer 
than the last, and ultimately with diminishing returns.

In  the  summaries  of  Mythos  books  (see  Chapter  11: 
Tomes of Eldritch Lore), reading times for books are given 
in weeks. The Keeper should never feel at the mercy of such 
numbers and should shrink or increase them as appropriate. 
An outstanding academic with pertinent language skills will 
read  a  book  faster  than  an  earnest-but-uneducated  jour-
nalist. Time of study need not be consecutive days, weeks, 
or months. Note that for a subsequent study of a book, it 
is recommended that the full reading time is doubled and 
never reduced.

Only one tome may be studied at a time.

  After  an  hour  of  careful  searching,  Harvey  collects 
and  collates  the  Book  of  Eibon  from  the  cornfield. 
Later he decides to undertake a full study of the Book 
of Eibon, knowing that it will take around 32 weeks 
to complete. At the end of this period Harvey’s player 
notes  that  Harvey’s  Cthulhu  Mythos  knowledge  is 
still  well  below  the  book’s  Mythos  rating  of  33%,  so 
he gains the +8% Cthulhu Mythos skill points for a 
full study (CMF). Harvey’s player has already made 
a reading roll when Harvey made his initial reading, 
so she does not need to roll again. However, she must 
make  another  roll  for  Sanity  point  loss  (2D4),  this 
time only losing 3 points. 

Harvey can begin a further study of the Book of 
Eibon if he so wishes, but it will take twice as long (64 
weeks), at the end of which he would lose another 2D4 
Sanity points and gain the full study’s worth of +8% 
points of Cthulhu Mythos skill (so long as his Cthulhu 
Mythos skill remains below the tome’s Mythos rating). 
A third full study would take Harvey 128 weeks (al-
most two and a half years).

Mythos Rating—Books as References
Once a full study of a tome has been completed, the percen-
tiles entered for its Cthulhu Mythos Rating also quantify its 
usefulness as a Mythos reference. Such a book may be able to 
provide a specific fact about the Mythos (such as how long 
a  chthonian  takes  to  reach  maturity,  or  where Y’golonac’s 
body  awaits  its  resurrection)  that  might  be  useful  to  the 
investigator’s current situation or line of research.

To research a specific piece of information, the investi-
gator spends 1D4 game hours poring through the book. The 
player then rolls 1D100; if the result is equal to or less than 

the  book’s  Cthulhu  Mythos  Rating,  the  investigator  finds 
the fact or an allusion to the fact (the Keeper can express the 
information as clearly or obscurely as desired). If the roll is 
failed, either the book does not hold the information or the 
reader failed to locate it. The user of the book will want to 
note what was or was not contained.

Increase of Other Skills
Conducting  a  full  study  of  a  tome  may  grant  an  increase 
in other skills as well as Cthulhu Mythos. After a full study 
of a tome, the reader automatically gains a skill tick for the 
language in which the book is written, and so their skill in 
that language may improve in the usual way during the next 
investigator development phase (see page 94). The Keeper 
should also determine whether a particular tome will pro-
vide  additional  benefits  to  the  reader.  Increases  should  be 
either  limited  to  +1D6  to  +1D10  skill  points  per  skill,  or 
simply awarded as a skill tick to be rolled during the next 
investigator  development  phase.  Other  skills  that  may  be 
improved as a result of reading Mythos tomes include (but 
are not limited to) History, Archaeology, Anthropology, Oc-
cult, Astronomy, and other sciences like Chemistry, Biology, 
and Physics. 

Occult Books
The ideas for handling the information in Mythos books can 
also apply to non-Mythos books as well. An occult book by 
definition grants points to the Occult skill after being read. 
An occult book does not contain knowledge increasing the 
Cthulhu Mythos skill—otherwise it would be classified as a 
Mythos book. Some occult books may well include discus-
sions of non-Mythos magic (see Non-Mythos Magic, page 
180), including instructions for spells. An occult book may 
cost Sanity points if its contents warrant it.

chapter 9: magicUsing Magic
Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy is the tomb where 
no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose 
wizards are all ashes.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Festival

Increasing the Cthulhu Mythos skill widens the horizons of 
the student but chips away at mental reserves (reducing max-
imum  Sanity  points).  However,  learning  about  the  Mythos 
may also let the scholar change reality in specific ways. These 
“packets of information” are organized as spells. They require 
activation, measured in the game by Magic points.

Learning a Spell
A selection of spells for the game is presented alphabetically 
in Chapter 12: Grimoire.

Learning  a  Mythos  spell  does  not  cost  Sanity  points; 

however, casting a Mythos spell does.

Any individual can learn a spell. Studying the Mythos is 
the last thing a person should do, since increasing Mythos 
knowledge  always  brings  the  character  closer  and  closer 
to  the  time  when  insanity  or  the  Mythos  stakes  its  claim. 
Sometimes circumstances demand such sacrifice.

Knowledge of a spell can be transferred in three ways, listed 
below. Learning from a book is by far the most common method.

Magic Points (MP)
Magic points must (in most cases) be expended to cast spells, 
as  well  as  to  energize  artifacts,  power  magical  gates,  and 
so  on. An  investigator  begins  the  game  with  Magic  points 
equal to one-fifth of his or her POW; however, cultists and 
powerful  sorcerers  often  have  larger  pools  of  points  from 
which to draw. 

Once an individual is out of Magic points, any further ex-
penditure is deducted directly from hit points. Any such loss of 
hit points will manifest as physical damage in a form chosen by 
the Keeper—perhaps sores and cuts opening on the body, skin 
blistering, or blood running from the eyes or ears.

Spending  or  sacrificing  Magic  points  or  points  of 
POW takes only the will of the owner. Doing so may leave 
sensations of pleasure mingled with regret, a numbness of 
the soul, or may not be noticeable at all. The spell caster’s 
essence or energy is channeled into powering the spell.

Some magical attacks leech Magic points or POW from 
unwilling targets. In those cases, loss may be characterized as 
being painful or as leaving a headache, or other minor symp-
toms. Involuntary loss of 10 POW would be a stronger sen-
sation than that of losing the same amount of Magic points.
If Magic points reach zero, the investigator deducts fur-

ther Magic point loss from hit points (one for one).

Regeneration of Magic points is a natural function, re-
turning at one Magic point per hour (two Magic points per 
hour for those with POW over 100, three Magic points per 
hour if POW is over 200 and so on). The number of Magic 
points  cannot  regenerate  to  a  value  above  one-fifth  of  the 
character’s POW. 

Magic  points  lost  as  hit  points  are  healed  according 
to  the  rules  for  Wounds and Healing  (page  119).  Healing 
of  hit  points  and  regeneration  of  Magic  points  can  occur 
concurrently.

Were  a  character  to  obtain  Magic  points  of  a  quantity 
greater  than  one-fifth  of  his  or  her  POW,  these  could  be 
spent, but the excess could not be regenerated.

Learning a Spell from a Mythos Book
Following an investigator conducting an initial reading of a 
book, the Keeper will indicate the presence and summarize 
each of the spells in a sentence or two, assuming the book 
contains  spells.  The  Keeper  should  not  use  the  rulebook 
name  of  a  spell,  but  might  instead  offer  a  description  like 
“broughte forth a Great Winged Beast from ye void which 
did sore crowde my place of busyness,” in place of the too 
accurate and too bland Summon Byakhee. Likewise, a spell 
called “the unremitting terror,” sounds a lot more credible 
than  Implant  Fear.  Suggestions  for  alternative  names  for 
spells are listed in Chapter 12: The Grimoire.

To  learn  a  spell  from  a  Mythos  book  requires  that  the 
investigator has at least made an initial reading of the book. 
The investigator chooses the spell to study. Learning a spell 
can take hours, days, weeks, or months (typically 2D6 weeks, 
but at the Keeper’s discretion). Just as with reading a Mythos 
book, learning a Mythos spell may be taken up, put aside, 
and  taken  up  again,  as  convenient.  Usually  a  roll  is  called 
for at this stage; however, the Keeper may choose to grant 
automatic success, depending on the scenario.

If success is not automatic, the player should attempt a 
Hard INT roll to learn the spell. If the player fails the roll, the 
investigator has not learned the spell. The player may ask to 
push the roll, but must justify doing so; for example, the in-
vestigator might lock themselves away in isolation until the 
spell is mastered. When thinking of consequences for failing 
a  pushed  roll,  the  Keeper  should  be  creative  and  include 
Sanity  point  loss  and  strange  magical  effects—both  upon 
the investigator and their surroundings. If investigator is in 
no hurry, they may continue to work on learning the spell 
without  pushing  the  roll.  The  timing  of  the  next  INT  roll 
is at the Keeper’s discretion (perhaps once per two weeks).

Learning a Spell from Another Person
Having  learned  a  spell,  a  character  may  teach  it  to  others. 
One-on-one  teaching  is  quicker  than  one  person  learning 
from  a  book  and,  typically,  a  spell  can  be  learned  in  one 
week or less (1D8 days). Use the same rules as for learning 
a spell from a book, bearing in mind that the process will 
be faster.

176 

Call of CthulhuLearning a Spell from a Mythos Entity
At will, any intelligent Mythos entity might supply a book 
or a scroll detailing a spell. More characteristically, the entity 
imparts  such  knowledge  by  means  of  dreams  or  visions; 
each episode is disturbing and alienating, gnawing away at 
the character’s sanity and will. This may happen quickly or 
slowly, as the story requires. A Mythos entity may imbue a 
complete  spell  in  a  character’s  mind  by  telepathy,  though 
such  a  powerful  experience  also  might  send  the  character 
directly to the asylum—the Keeper should consider the level 
of Sanity loss (a minimum of 1D6 is suggested).

Once  the  process  is  complete,  the  Keeper  may  require 
the target to make a successful INT roll to retain knowledge 
of the spell. If this fails, the process must be started anew.

Investigators rarely receive information in this manner; 

however, cultists often do.

Casting Spells

We have no business calling in such things from outside, and 
only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Dunwich Horror

Manipulating the forces of the Cthulhu Mythos leads to a 
loss of Sanity points in amounts that vary by spell. If some 
awful creature arrives in response to a spell, encountering it 
costs yet more Sanity points. Having no Sanity points does 
not prohibit spells from being cast—if it did, there would 
be no cultists.

Nearly all spells and many magical artifacts also require 
Magic points (or POW, if that is the need), to be expended, 
otherwise the spell does not activate and nothing happens.

Physical components may be necessary for particular spells. 
Such components may be reusable; for example, the great men-
hirs necessary for summoning He Who Is Not to Be Named 
(Call Hastur, see page 248). Other components may be con-
sumed during the spell, such as the drinking of space-mead.

The time required to cast a spell is variable—it may be 
instantaneous, a few seconds, a game minute, a game week, 
or longer.

The caster must know the spell and recite a sometimes 
complex  and  lengthy  chant  or  rite  in  authoritative  tones. 
Usually  the  caster  must  have  complete  freedom  of  move-
ment, since gesture can be as important as chant.

A casting roll is required when a character attempts to 
cast a newly learned spell for the first time. Once a spell has 
been  successfully  cast  (even  if  a  pushed  roll  was  required 

Reading and translating Mythos tomes often takes months, even years.

177 

chapter 9: magicto  do  so),  subsequent  uses  do  not  require  a  casting  roll; 
non-player  characters  and  monsters  do  not  need  to  make 
casting rolls.

A Hard POW roll is required to successfully cast a spell 
the  first  time.  If  the  casting  roll  is  successful,  refer  to  the 
spell description for the outcome. If the casting roll is failed, 
nothing happens.

Following a failed casting roll, the character has a choice 
whether to make a second attempt to cast the spell (paying 
the costs a second time)—either immediately or at any time 
in the future—and, in doing so, push the casting roll. 

If the pushed casting roll is successful, the spell works nor-
mally without negative consequences. If the pushed casting 
roll  is  failed,  the  spell  still  works  normally,  but  dire  conse-
quences ensue for the caster. Ultimately a spell can always be 
cast—the casting roll gauges the harm the caster suffers in the 
process rather than success or failure of the spell.

The only alternative to this (other than giving up on the 
spell) is to go back to the source and learn the spell again 
from  scratch—usually  requiring  another  2D6  weeks  and 
a  Hard  INT  roll. After  relearning  the  spell,  another  initial 
casting  roll  may  be  made—this  is  a  much  more  cautious 
approach  than  pushing  the  casting  roll.  This  is  one  of  the 
reasons why wizards seek to extend their lives—miscasting 
the greater spells can be a fast route to the grave!

Failing a Pushed 
Casting Roll
The caster must pay the cost of the spell (Magic points, San-
ity points, and/or POW) multiplied by 1D6. Any overspend 
of Magic points is deducted from hit points—this can cause 
major wounds or death when pushing powerful spells. 

The  Keeper  should  add  one  or  more  of  the  following 
side  effects  for  less  powerful  spells  (choose  or  roll  1D8). 
Note that both the caster and others nearby can be affected.

1:  Blurred vision or temporary blindness.
2:  Disembodied screaming, voices, or other noises.
3:  Strong winds or other atmospheric effects.
4:  Bleeding—from  the  caster,  others  present,  or  the 

environment (e.g. the walls).
5:  Strange visions and hallucinations.
6:  Small animals in the vicinity explode.
7:  Foul smell of brimstone.
8:  Mythos monster is accidentally summoned.
For more powerful spells (those that summon gods or 

cost POW for example), the side effects can be worse:

1:  Earth shaking, walls rent asunder.
2:  Epic thunder and lightning.
3:  Blood falls from the sky.

Matthew’s initial attempt to cast the “Contact Ghoul” 
spell  has  failed,  and  he  has  decided  to  push  the  roll 
to try again. Unfortunately, the pushed roll fails too. 
Matthew has 13 Magic points and 13 hit points.

The  cost  of  the  spell  is  1D3  Sanity  points  and  5 
Magic points—reduced to 4 Magic points by the Keeper 
because it is being cast in a moonlit graveyard. Mat-
thew has already paid the cost twice: once for the first 
attempt and once for the pushed roll immediately after 
(leaving him 5 Magic points). Now he must pay more. 
A 4 is rolled on the 1D6 multiplier, so Matthew must 
pay 16 Magic points (4 MP × 4 = 16) and 9 Sanity 
points (4D3), as the Mythos power burns through him. 
The  Keeper  describes  a  sound  like  thunder  as  a 
nearby  gravestone  explodes,  showering  Matthew  in 
shards of stone (linking events in the story to the phys-
ical  damage  inflicted  by  the  rules).  Matthew  must 
spend  16  Magic  points.  He  has  5  Magic  Points  left; 
these are spent and he still owes 11, which must come 
from his hit points. Luckily, Matthew has 13 hit points 
and  was  previously  uninjured.  The  damage  reduces 
Matthew to 2 hit points. Matthew lost over half his hit 
points in one blow (a major wound) and must make a 
CON roll to remain conscious. When he recovers, the 
Sanity  point  loss  will  have  resulted  in  insanity.  The 
Keeper amends two of his background entries, one for 
the wound and one for the insanity.

As  the  dust  settles,  Matthew’s  friend  may  notice 
the pale humanoid figure crouching behind the rem-
nants  of  the  sundered  gravestone.  The  spell  worked 
(as it must when the casting roll is pushed)—time for 
a Sanity roll!

4:  The caster’s hand is withered and burnt.
5:  The caster ages unnaturally (+2D10 years and apply 

characteristic modifiers, see Age, page 32).

6:  Powerful  or  numerous  Mythos  entities  appear,  at-
tacking all those nearby, starting with the caster!
7:  The caster or everyone nearby are sucked to a dis-

tant time or place.

8:  Mythos deity is accidentally called.
When  hit  points  are  lost  as  a  result  of  overspending 
Magic points, the Keeper should narrate the physical harm 
as a part of the physical consequence of the casting. 

Evidence of Spells Being Cast
The  damage  done  by  a  spell  is  probably  obvious.  A  visible 
manifestation of a spell being cast may not be so apparent. If 
it  is,  one  might  spot  a  peculiar  hand  gesture  or  body  move-
ment,  or  notice  some  unusual  item  or  necessary  ingredient. 
In  themselves,  such  effects  will  begin  to  establish  a  tone  for 
Mythos magic, so Keepers are cautioned to keep such effects 
low-key. However, the effects could be wide-ranging, from hid-

178 

Call of Cthulhueous roars from beyond, gouts of fire, lines of electrical force, 
pale nimbuses and auroras of various colors, to the rushing of 
winds, raised hackles, ionized air, prickly sensations, the stench 
of  sulfur,  howling  and  hissing  animals,  murmuring  voices, 
alarming moans, or whatever the Keeper thinks fitting.

Disrupted Spell Casting
The  casting  of  a  spell  will  be  disrupted  if  the  caster  is  sig-
nificantly distracted (physically struck or shot, for example) 
during its casting.. The Keeper may consult the charts for the 
consequences  of  failing  a  pushed  casting  roll  (see  previous 
page) for inspiration on what might happen. The caster of a 
failed spell casting must still pay the Sanity point and Magic 
point costs.

Becoming a Believer

Leng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not 
a region I would care to be in or near, nor did I relish the 
proximity of a world that had ever bred such ambiguous and 
Archaean monstrosities as those Lake had just mentioned. 
At the moment I felt sorry that I had ever read the abhorred 
Necronomicon, or talked so much with that unpleasantly 
erudite folklorist Wilmarth at the university.

—H.P. Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness

An investigator who comes face-to-face with a deep one or a 
ghoul has an experience that leaves no option but to believe in 
the cosmic horror of the Cthulhu Mythos. However, reading 
the Cultes des Goules while safe in an apartment with the lights 
on, the reader might dismiss the contents as a work of fantasy. 
This is the player’s prerogative, but disbelief has it perils.

 Whether one believes what is read or not, the knowledge 
is still absorbed. If the character chooses not to believe what 
is  read  then  the  Cthulhu  Mythos  knowledge  granted  by 
the book is added to the investigator’s skill and maximum 
Sanity  points  are  reduced  by  the  corresponding  amount, 
but  no  Sanity  points  are  lost.  In  this  way  an  investigator 
can  accumulate  considerable  knowledge  of  the  Cthulhu 
Mythos  without  losing  any  Sanity  points  at  all.  However, 
when  encountering  evidence  of  the  Mythos  firsthand,  the 
investigator will realize that those accursed books held the 
truth! At that point the investigator becomes a believer and 
immediately loses Sanity points equal to his or her present 
Cthulhu Mythos score. 

Keepers may be relieved that this requires little bookkeep-
ing on their part. The player records their investigator’s gain 
of Cthulhu Mythos skill as normal and it is that value that is 
deducted from their Sanity points when becoming a believer. 
An investigator can choose to remain a nonbeliever until 
forced to lose Sanity points for encountering the Mythos first-
hand. Viewing  human  corpses  or  torture  may  cause  Sanity 
point loss, but such loss does not lead to belief in the Mythos. 
A nonbeliever may read Mythos books and learn (but not 
cast) spells. Firsthand experience of the Mythos always calls 
for a Sanity roll, and the loss of one or more of Sanity points 

"Shoot..was that a ph'ngui or a ph'nguy?"

compel  an  investigator  to  believe  in  the  Cthulhu  Mythos 
thereafter. However, even some firsthand experiences may not 
convince a disbeliever; if a Sanity roll is passed for encoun-
tering a deep one (SAN 0/1D6) no Sanity points are lost and, 
as such, an investigator might remain a nonbeliever, perhaps 
rationalizing the creature as Earthly human mutation. How-
ever, meeting a clearly unearthly being or a manifestation of 
one of the gods of the Mythos will always be enough to rip 
through the façade of the investigator’s beliefs.

An investigator can become a believer at any point the 

player wishes (and take the Sanity point loss).

How Sorcerers Get That Way
Though investigators rarely have the chance, sorcerers and 
cultists sometimes swagger around with unseemly amounts 
of Power (POW). Where did it come from? 

When a character successfully casts a spell requiring an 
opposed POW roll to affect the target, this creates a chance 
for the caster’s POW to increase through this “exercise”. If 
the caster wins the opposed POW roll, a subsequent roll to 
increase his or her POW may be attempted. If the result of 
a 1D100 roll is greater than the caster’s POW (or the roll is 
96  or  greater),  the  caster’s  POW  increases  by  1D10  points 
permanently.

As a reward for any Luck roll result of 01, POW can be 
said to have been exercised. Roll the percentile dice and if 
the roll is greater than the character’s POW, or if the roll is 
96 or greater, the character’s POW increases by 1D10 points 
permanently.

The character may be able to arrange a gift of or a trade 
for  POW  from  some  Mythos  deity.  The  rationale  for  this 
is best left to the Keeper. Such an event is likely to increase 

179 

chapter 9: magicErnest  has  never  encountered  the  Cthulhu  Mythos, 
but  found  a  copy  of  the  Cultes  des  Goules  among 
his late uncle’s possessions. Having finished an initial 
reading, the Keeper grants Ernest +4 points of Cthul-
hu Mythos skill and describes some of the book’s con-
tents and the magical rituals it purports to document. 
The  Keeper  then  asks  whether  Ernest  believes  what 
he  is  reading.  Ernest  is  a  scientist  and  has  no  truck 
with  this  superstitious  mumbo-jumbo,  though  he  is 
intrigued by it. Ernest therefore loses no Sanity points 
as a result of his reading.

Weeks  later,  Ernest  encounters  a  ghoul  while 
delving around the family vault, and fails his Sanity 
roll.  In  addition  to  the  Sanity  point  loss  for  seeing 
the ghoul (1D6), Ernest must also lose Sanity points 
equal to his present Cthulhu Mythos skill at the reve-
lation that his accumulated knowledge of the Mythos 
is founded on truth! Ernest loses 6 Sanity points (4 for 
the Cthulhu Mythos skill points he gained when read-
ing the tome plus 2 for encountering the ghoul). The 
loss  is  potentially  insanity  inducing—Ernest  passes 
his Intelligence roll and goes temporarily insane.

Cthulhu Mythos as well, and would cost additional Sanity 
points besides those lost in communicating with the entity.
Increasing  Power  does  not  increase  current  Sanity 

points.

Non-Mythos Magic
Other earthly magic or religiosity can be significant and can 
have effects in the game if the Keeper wills it. Such earthly 
“magick”  may  be  real  or  fraudulent;  this  is  for  the  Keeper 
(perhaps in discussion with the player group) to determine.
Mechanics and procedures for such magic should be the 
same as those for Mythos magic, though the means and aims 
of earthly magic will greatly differ. If non-Mythos magic is 
accepted in your game, it is suggested that you tie it to the 
Occult skill. Horrific deeds should always cost Sanity points.

Optional Rules
Spontaneous Use of the  

Cthulhu Mythos Skill
Knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos not only allows a character 
to  learn  and  cast  spells,  it  also  allows  someone  to  improvise 
magical effects akin to spells. This is resolved in the same way 
as any regular skill use. The player first states an aim; the Keeper 
then considers if the aim is acceptable, suggesting a lesser aim 
in preference to blocking the player’s proposal if possible. 

The default difficulty level for use of the Cthulhu Mythos 
skill in this way is Regular. Alternatively, if the character is using 
their  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  to  affect  a  target  that  is  resisting 
them, treat this as an opposed roll between the caster’s Cthulhu 

Mythos  skill  and  the  target’s  POW;  no  further  POW-versus-
POW roll is required. In addition, the Keeper must decide on 
a cost in Magic points and Sanity points. The Keeper should 
gauge the cost and make it similar to a comparable spell. See the 
guidance in Chapter 11: Playing the Game. 

The  cost  and  consequence  of  pushing  the  Cthulhu 
Mythos skill roll and failing are the same as those for failing 
a pushed spell casting roll. The Keeper may allow the play-
er’s aim to be achieved when a pushed roll is failed, however 
this is not guaranteed as it is for a spell.

Unlike casting a spell, using the Cthulhu Mythos skill to 

achieve a given effect must be rolled for every time.
Some illustrations of spontaneous Cthulhu Mythos skill use:

To  cause  physical  harm  to  one  target:  the  caster  chooses 
the number of Magic points expended, and loses half that 
number of Sanity points. To be effective, the caster needs to 
beat the target in an opposed Cthulhu Mythos versus POW 
roll. If the caster wins the roll, the target takes damage equal 
to  the  number  of  magic  points  expended.  Nelson  extends 
his hand and screams, “Die!” The veins on his arms bulge 
and  turn  black,  and  he  focuses  on  the  approaching  beast. 
Nelson’s player spends 8 Magic points and 4 Sanity points, 
and then makes a Cthulhu Mythos skill roll, getting a Hard 
success (below half his skill). The Keeper makes a POW roll 
for the target, achieving a Regular success–Nelson wins. The 
Keeper describes the beast’s veins erupting in a mess of gore 
and deducts 8 hit points.

To  banish  a  monster:  the  caster  spends  Magic  points  equal 
to  one-fifth  of  the  monster’s  POW  and  1D3  Sanity  points. 
The caster must then succeed in an opposed Cthulhu Mythos 
versus  POW  roll  against  the  monster.  Enoch  stands  silently 
with eyes closed as the dark young of Shub-Niggurath stomps 
out of the tree line. Enoch has only 14 Magic points and must 
expend 18 to attempt to banish the monstrosity. He does so; 
taking 4 hit points of harm (the excess Magic point cost is paid 
in hit points). He whispers strange words to the beast, uncaring 
of the bloody tears that are flowing from his now open eyes. 
Enoch’s  player  makes  a  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  roll,  getting  a 
Regular success. The Keeper makes a POW roll for dark young, 
achieving  a  Hard  success–the  dark  young  wins.  The  Keeper 
tells how the dark young strides towards Enoch, who lacks the 
Magic points to push the roll and so turns to flee.

To  commune  with  the  recently  deceased:  costs  the  caster 
10  Magic  points  plus  1D10  Sanity  points.  The  effects  last 
a  few  rounds.  Charlie  dies  just  as  the  investigators  get  to 
him. “Tell us who killed you,” they ask him, but it is too late. 
Placing her hands on Charlie’s chest, Violet implores Charlie 
to speak. Violet’s player spends 10 Magic points and 3 Sanity 
points,  and  then  makes  a  successful  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill 
roll. The Keeper explains, “You hear Charlie’s words croak 
from Violet’s throat…” The other players can now talk with 
Charlie  for  a  few  rounds.  The  Keeper  decides  enough  has 
been said and says, “Blood begins to bubble up in Violet’s 
throat. Violet you’re back! But you feel cold, so cold!”

Call of CthulhuLaurence (Daphne’s investigator) is sure that the ancient 
stone  tablet  he  holds  can  yield  valuable  information, 
yet he lacks the arcane knowledge required to unlock its 
secrets. Daphne looks at the Keeper and asks, “What if I 
try to use my Mythos knowledge to find a way?”

Keeper: “OK, what are you doing?”
Daphne:  “Holding  the  tablet  and  staring  deeply 

into it, mumbling under my breath.”

The Keeper considers that it would be cool if Lau-
rence could unlock the knowledge in the tablet, as it 
would move the game on nicely.

Keeper: “OK, it’ll cost you 3 Magic points and 1 

Sanity point—give me a roll.”

Laurence  has  14  Cthulhu  Mythos,  Daphne  rolls 

84—a failure. Nothing happens.

Daphne  considers:  “Bother!  I  go  outside,  under 
the  moon  and  start  yelling  out  the  names  of  all  the 
Mythos gods that I’ve read about and try to open my 
mind to the tablet.”

The  Keeper  likes  the  sound  of  this  and  agrees  to 
a  pushed  roll.  Daphne  crosses  off  another  3  Magic 
points and 1 Sanity point.

Daphne fails again, with a roll of 34. Laurence will 
have to suffer the consequences. She rolls 3 on 1D6 for the 
multiplier (see The consequences of Failing a Pushed 
Casting Roll, page 178), so Laurence must lose another 
9  Magic  points  (3  ×  3)  and  another  3  Sanity  points. 
Laurence has now spent 15 Magic points, which is more 
than he possesses, so he loses several hit points as well, 
leading the Keeper to include physical harm as part of the 
consequence of failing the pushed roll. Whether Daphne 
gains any insights is up to the Keeper.

The  Keeper  describes  the  consequence:  “You  are 
squeezing  the  tablet  so  hard  that  the  skin  on  your 
hands begins to blister and split. Blood starts to seep 
out.  It  crawls  across  the  tablet  and  begins  to  form 
letters. You  stare  intently  at  the  letters  as  they  form 
words. You can read the words, they say…”

The Keeper decides to grant Daphne some insight 
into the knowledge held within the tablet, but at quite 
a cost to Laurence’s health and sanity.

Call of Cthulhueing the Keeper can be immensely rewarding; 
you get to make a lot of decisions about what 
happens during the game, present the mystery 
to the players, and portray numerous non-play-
er characters and monsters. You will also be the 
final arbiter of how rules are applied, and this 
chapter contains advice and guidance intended to help you 
use those rules to best effect. 

Before  reading  this  chapter  make  sure  you  have  read 

chapters 4-10. 

New Keepers
When you act as Keeper you become the game moderator. 
Whether you are using a published scenario or creating one 
of your own, you alone know the story plot and the likely 
outcomes and solutions. Your job is to present the mystery 
and story during play, incidentally playing the roles of mon-
sters and sinister or ordinary people that the investigators 
meet. You have the responsibility for preparing and running 
the scenario without bias. Above all else, you should listen to 
your players and react to what they say and do.

Having a good understanding of the game and the rules 
is essential in enabling you to answer player questions and to 
be able to present the material fairly. You will find individual 
monster and spell descriptions in other chapters—you don’t 
need to memorize this information, just be familiar with it.
With the purchase of this book and some dice, you have 
everything needed to play Call of Cthulhu. It is recommend-
ed that you start with either The Haunting—in the Call of 
Cthulhu  Quick-Start  Rules,  a  free  download  at  www.chao-
sium.com, or Amidst the Ancient Trees (page 346). These 
scenarios have been specifically presented for new Keepers, 
with  advice  dotted  throughout  the  text.  Pick  one  to  play, 
read  the  scenario  through,  and  then  invite  some  friends 
over  to  play.  Have  them  create  investigators  together—be 
sure to have the relevant sheets printed out or photocopied 
in advance.

Summarize  the  rules  for  your  players.  Don’t  try  to  ex-
plain every rule in detail—just give them a brief overview 
and  then  address  specific  rules  as  they  arise  in  play.  Once 
everyone is ready, introduce the scenario and work your way 

When meeting  
prospective players 
for the first time, try 
to arrange to meet in 
a safe public place

them.

through it.

Do not be concerned if 
you  make  some  mistakes 
the first time around. When 
you  have  finished  playing, 
read through the rules and 
this  chapter  again.  After 
having run one game, the 
rules and advice will make 
a lot more sense. You will 
continue  to  hone  your

with the game.

Experienced 
Keepers
The Call of Cthulhu roleplaying 
game has been around for over 
30 years, so many of you reading 
this will be old hands when it 
comes to running the game. You 
will have noticed that this  
edition presents some  
modifications to the rules and 
this chapter is intended to offer 
advice on how to integrate these 
changes into your game.

You may wish to invent your own scenarios—that’s great, 
but it’s probably best to start with the ones in this book or 
consult  one  of  the  many  Call  of  Cthulhu  scenario  supple-
ments available. Published scenarios can be a great source of 
information about crafting a story into an adventure, as well 
as providing an insight into how the game can be played.  

Finding Players
Okay, so you’ve got the Call of Cthulhu rulebook and some 
roleplaying  dice,  and  you’re  ready  to  run  a  game—except 
you’ve got no players! What can you do?

Here are a few ideas to get you gaming:
Talk  to  your  friends.  Show  them  the  rulebook  and  tell 
them about how cool the game sounds. Perhaps get them to 
read one of Lovecraft’s stories to see if they like it, preferably 
a  short  one  like  The  Outsider.  You  could  also  ask  family 
members to try the game. Essentially, you only need a Keep-
er  and  one  player,  but  if  you  can  get  two  or  three  players 
together then that’s ideal. 

Ask in your local hobby store or put a notice up. Talk to 
the staff in the hobby store and ask if there is a game of Call 
of Cthulhu you can join—many stores have gaming rooms 
where  people  can  get  together  to  play.  Perhaps  a  group  is 
looking  for  a  new  player?  Failing  that,  ask  if  you  can  put 
a notice up saying that you want to start a Call of Cthulhu 
game and need players.

Many schools, colleges, and universities have roleplaying 
societies and groups. If there’s not one where you are, per-
haps you can start one. This can be a really good way to meet 
like-minded people.

Go to a local gaming convention. Gaming conventions 
come in all shapes and sizes, and they are held all around 
the  world.  Perhaps  your  local  gaming  store  can  point  you 
in the right direction. Conventions provide the opportunity 
to  meet  new  people,  make  friends,  and  play  games.  Even 
though you might not find anyone local to you, you’ll have 
the  chance  to  play  games  and  get  some  experience  before 
starting your own group.

Call of CthulhuLook  online  at  Cthulhu  gaming  sites.  Look  at  www.
yog-sothoth.com and www.mu-podcast.com, where people 
from all around the world discuss Call of Cthulhu. 

Preparing to Play the Game
The  purpose  of  roleplaying  is  to  have  a  good  time—that 
should not need saying, but as with any hobby, some people 
get so caught up in the moment that they lose sight of this 
most basic of requirements.

Some tips for creating atmosphere in your games:
Try to play in a room where there is no one but the gam-
ing group; having your daughter running around the table 
or your brother watching football on TV in the same room 
is not going to help!

Set up the gaming area appropriately. Close the curtains 
and  dim  the  lights  a  little  (remember  you  still  need  to  be 
able to read the scenario and the players need to be able to 
see  their  investigator  sheets  and  the  dice).  Using  low-light 
lamps, LED penlights, or candles can be very effective—but 
never leave lit candles unattended!

Turn  cell/mobile  phones  to  silent  (or  preferably  turn 
them off) for the duration of the game. Likewise, put away 
the computers and tablets—everyone’s focus should be on 
the game. Being distracted by electronic devices is a surefire 
way to dispel any sense of atmosphere.

Suitable  music  playing  low  in  the  background  can  be 
great for establishing a mood. Avoid pop and rock songs as 
familiarity  and  the  sudden  changes  in  tempo  and  volume 
can  work  against  you.  Look  for  atmospheric  classical  mu-
sic  or  soundscapes  of  electronic  music.  Published  music 
especially written for horror roleplaying games can also be 
purchased. Period music (appropriate to the scenario) can 
also help, such as twenties jazz played at a low volume.

Setting the Tone
Consider what sort of game you want to run. You can aim 
for high tension, over-the-top schlock horror, or a pulp-ac-
tion romp. Having said that, the default mode for this game 
is  intended  to  be  horror  with  some  action  scenes  thrown 
into the mix. 

You should decide, as a group, whether the game is to be 
serious or jocular. Comedy and horror are good bedfellows 
and the switch from one to the other is used to great effect in 
many movies. However, too much comedy lessens the horror. 
The way that you act (as Keeper) reinforces or undermines 
the tone. As Keeper, you may find that the players take their 
lead from you, not only in what you say, but how you behave. 
You  may  set  the  scene  and  build  the  pace  and  the  tension, 
only to have a player make a joke remark and for everyone 
to fall about laughing, breaking the tension and ruining the 
atmosphere. Shared jokes and laughing are important, but as 
the game draws to a climax, so too should the horror. 

If you are seeking a more intense gaming experience, talk 
to your players about atmosphere and tell them at the start of 
a gaming session that tonight’s game will be more enjoyable 
for all if you can work together on building and maintaining 

Investigators don't always sleep easy.

a good atmosphere. Some groups use the first 30 minutes of 
a gaming session to share news, tell jokes, and relax—getting 
this all out of the way before the game begins. Try to draw a 
clear line between “social” time and “game” time.

This is a horror game and you can expect players to enjoy 
being scared; however, people have differing views of what is 
acceptable, and these limits should be discussed before play. 
Ask your players if there is anything that they definitely do not 
want to see in the game. The answers can be quite unexpect-
ed;  one  player  may  be  fine  with  everything  except  violence 
to animals, for example. Establish the level of their objection 
and either avoid the topic entirely or use the dramatic effect 
of “fading to black” when it occurs in play.

Distasteful Historical Themes
Distasteful issues may arise during the game. You may feel 
that  your  portrayal  of  fictional  prejudice  and  bigotry  is 
worthy  of  an  Oscar;  however,  another  player  may  find  it 
offensive. The world was a very different place in the 1920s. 
Behaviors most of us would find repugnant today were or-
dinary and acceptable then. Racism, xenophobia, religious 
bias,  and  sexual  discrimination  were  part  of  everyday  life 
and  often  loudly  espoused.  Many  laws  systematically  sup-
ported  segregation  and  discrimination  of  every  sort,  and 
social forces of great power underwrote that legislation.

Scenario authors and Keepers can choose to ignore so-
cial history as not germane, or decide to incorporate specific 
elements  into  their  plots.  Both  approaches  can  be  found 
in published scenarios. Ultimately how you play it is up to 
you and your group, but if you are going to use themes of 
discrimination in the game, it is strongly recommended that 
you discuss the issue early on.

185 

chapter 10: playing the gameInvestigators can come from all manners of backgrounds

Creating Investigators 
Creating an investigator is straightforward—just follow the 
rules in Chapter 3: Creating Investigators. There is plenty 
of supplementary information on period settings and pro-
fessions that can help the players expand and flesh out their 
investigators. A good place for more information is in the 
numerous Call of Cthulhu source books published by Chao-
sium, especially the Investigator Handbook, as this includes a 
lot of extra information and options for players.

Advising the Players
Once you are familiar with your scenario it is time to brief 
the players so that they can create suitable investigators. For 
a  standard  scenario  the  players  can  be  presented  with  an 
initial premise:

G  The date and location of the scenario.
G  A basic description of how the scenario begins.
G  Suggested  professions  suitable  to  the  scenario’s 

premise.

G  Suggestions  for  how  the  investigators  know  each 

other.

The more information the players have to work with, the 
better they can create investigators who will be tied into the 
plot and possess motivation to follow the story path. 

There  may  be  quite  a  lot  you  can  say  about  the  initial 

premise without giving away too much of what is to come. 
When  discussing  the  initial  premise,  you  might  consider 
telling the players information that would be unknown to 
their investigators at the outset of play

You’re  about  to  run  Amidst  the  Ancient  Trees,  the 
first  of  the  scenarios  at  the  back  of  this  book.  You 
deliver the premise thus: “The story is set in Vermont, 
1925. There’s been a kidnapping and a call is out for 
posses to head into the woods in search of the missing 
girl.  You’ll  probably  want  at  least  one  outdoorsman 
or hunter among the group. Most likely you’ll all be 
concerned  locals,  but  if  you  want  to  be  from  out  of 
town, you could be. How you know each other, if you 
do, is up to you.” 

Investigator Groups (I):                             
Integrated Investigators
Try to throw out as many “hooks” as possible in your initial 
premise.  One  way  to  involve  a  player  is  to  place  a  family 
member or friend in jeopardy; for example, “Your investi-
gator’s  brother  has  been  murdered.”  That’s  fine,  but  some 
players may not feel affected by the death of a fictional rela-
tive. However, if you volunteer the story-hook as a question 
to the players (“There’s been a murder—tell me who’s been 
killed"), a player may suggest the link (“Could the deceased 
be my brother?”). When the motivation is coming from the 
player,  you  can  be  sure  it  will  hold  a  lot  more  emotional 

186 

Call of CthulhuSome scenarios don’t require 
that the investigators know 
one another before the game 
starts. A game may begin with a 
disparate group of investigators 
compelled to action by some 
dramatic event. These adventures 
are often described as starting 
“in medias res”—in the middle 
of things. Think of these like 
a horror film in which random 
characters have to work          
together to survive; many zombie 
films work on such a premise. 
Some campaigns can begin this 
way too, with the investigators 
drawn together to combat 
the Mythos due to a shared            
experience that has changed 
their view of the world and their 
purpose in life.

Nick says his investigator grew up in a rural area but 
has since moved in search of work. Someone suggests 
a  travelling  salesman  and  Nick  likes  the  idea.  The 
Keeper asks Nick to say a little more about where he 
grew up and what his village was called. Nick states 
that his investigator grew up in a small town called 
Tingewick.  The  Keeper  immediately  changes  the 
name  of  the  town  in  the  scenario  from  Bennington 
to Tingewick. The Keeper asks a few more questions 
of the player. “Who do you remember? Any childhood 
friends, enemies, teachers, etc.?” The Keeper incorpo-
rates  some  of  Nick’s  responses  into  the  plot.  Rather 
than  adding  new  characters,  the  Keeper  simply 
changes some pre-existing non-player characters to fit 
those offered by the player. Nick mentions a girl his 
investigator was sweet on, and the Keeper immediate-
ly latches onto this and has her be the kidnap victim 
(adjusting her age accordingly), asking the player for 
the  girl’s  name  (again,  changing  this  detail  in  the 
scenario to fit the player’s contribution). 

resonance  for  that  particular  player  than  something  you 
impose.

This exchange works both ways. Just as the player should 
pick up on story-hooks that you provide, you should pick 
up on what the players say about their characters. The play-
ers are encouraged to come up with interesting backstories 
for  their  investigators,  and  you  should  listen  to  what  the 
players say and try to weave it into your existing story. These 
story-hooks might be listed as investigator backstories or be 
implied by the choice of profession or skills. 

Weave the investigators and the plot together wherever 
possible. This may feel contrived at times, but good drama 
is often a contrivance. Consider the cast of non-player char-
acters in the scenario. How many of them could be family 
members,  friends,  enemies,  or  associates  that  the  players 
have mentioned in their investigator backstories? You may 
have some detailed non-player characters prepared as part 
of the plot—consider if any of those non-player characters 
could be played as investigators. Don’t allow the non-player 
characters to outshine the investigators.

Ask  the  players  questions  about  their  investigators–—
their  backstories,  aspirations,  friends,  and  rivals,  and  take 
note of any replies that might be incorporated or noted for 
use  later. Alternatively,  you  might  suggest  amendments  to 
be  made  to  an  investigator  that  will  integrate  them  more 
closely to the plot. As stated earlier, this is a two-way process 
and everything is mutable at this stage. Get it right now and 
the game will flow more smoothly.

Many  of  the  details  in  your  scenario,  such  as  place 
names and character names, can easily be changed without 
affecting the core of the scenario. Incorporating names and 
other details that the players come up with can make those 
elements of the scenario feel more real to the players, and 
produces a more collaborative story to which everyone has 
contributed.

Investigator Groups (II):                       
Random Investigators
Some scenarios, especially “one-shots,” will work with a ran-
dom mix of investigators. In this case, simply allow each player 
to  create  an  investigator,  then  find  a  way  of  bringing  them 
together  and  a  reason  for  them  to  engage  with  the  scenario. 
The benefit of this approach is that players get free rein to make 
their investigators however they wish. This can work well in a 
scenario that takes random people and throws them into a sit-
uation, but is not so good for a more open-ended investigative 
scenario or campaign where the players would struggle for a 
reason why their investigators would work together.

All the Keeper tells the players is that the scenario is 
set in the modern day and that they can create what-
ever investigators they wish. The players end up with 
a  group  consisting  of  a  frail Archaeologist,  a  French 
dancer, an ex-KGB agent, and a middle-aged Ameri-
can housewife. The Keeper smiles and tells them they 
are  all  on  a  transatlantic  flight  as  the  game  begins. 
At  this  stage  the  investigators  don’t  even  know  each 
other, but the isolation of being 27,000 feet up in the 
air throws them together for the scenario. Fun will no 
doubt be had through the clash of personalities. If they 
survive the scenario, it would seem unlikely that they 
would ever have cause to meet again, let alone team 
up to carry out future investigations.

187 

chapter 10: playing the gameInvestigator Groups (III):             
Pre-Generated Investigators
You can create the investigators before play and then distrib-
ute them among the players. This approach works well for 
games where play is restricted to a set time slot, such as at a 
gaming convention.

 Try to remember the following factors when designing 

investigators for other people:

Archetypes  are  quickly  accessible:  The  grizzled  ex-cop, 
curious reporter, etc. 

Balance: Try to balance the group so that each player will 
get a turn in the spotlight. Consider the requirements of the 
scenario in terms of skills and plot-hooks, and share these 
with the investigators. Avoid basing the scenario around one 
investigator, as this may leave the other players feeling they 
are  playing  mere  cameo  roles.  Presenting  balanced  inves-
tigators does not require that every investigator be equally 
good  at  all  things.  Just  be  sure  that  each  investigator  has 
strengths that will come into play; one investigator might be 
good with their fists, while another is strong academically. 

Backstory:  Write  a  backstory  for  each  investigator,  but 
don’t  write  too  much  because  some  players  may  struggle 
to remember or make use of backstory information. If the 
scenario  depends  upon  a  particular  investigator  knowing 
certain  information,  be  sure  to  make  it  very  clear  to  the 
player—don’t hide it in a large body of text. Be sure to allow 
players time to read and digest their backstories at the start 
of play, and consider using bullet points to summarize es-
sential information.

Unallocated skill points: Consider leaving some skill points 
unallocated  to  allow  each  player  to  customize  their  own 
investigator.

Tell  each  investigator  what  he  or  she  knows  about  the 
other investigators: You  may  also  want  to  provide  a  brief 
résumé for each investigator, listing what he or she knows 
about the other investigators, though this is not essential. If 
you do write one, it should be partial, being based on that 
particular investigator’s point of view—an individual’s per-
ception of a particular person can conflict with another’s, or 
be wholly mistaken.

Say  what  they  know,  not  how  they  feel:  Rather  than  dic-
tating  how  an  investigator  feels  in  their  backstory,  tell  the 
player  the “facts”  as  their  investigator  perceives  them,  and 
let the player decide what is true and how they feel about it. 

In place of, “You bear a grudge against Trevor who stole 
your girlfriend,” simply write the facts as that investi-
gator understands them, “Trevor stole the affections of 
your girlfriend”. It’s then up to the player to decide how 
his or her investigator feels about losing his girlfriend 
and what effect it has upon his relationship with Trevor.

Write  reciprocal  backstory  information:  If  you  write  a 
statement  for  one  investigator  regarding  another,  be  sure 
to  write  a  reciprocal  statement  on  the  other  investigator’s 
sheet. As already stated, different investigators may perceive 
different versions of the same truth. 

If one investigator (Brian) is told, “Trevor stole the af-
fections of your girlfriend”, it is important that Trevor’s 
player also be told about this. This might take a slightly 
conflicting form: “You’re friends with Suzie. She used 
to go out with Brian until she got bored with him”.

Approving the Investigators
Take a few minutes to look over the investigator sheets. En-
sure the players have completed their investigators correctly 
(have skill points all been spent?) Then note down a few de-
tails about each investigator along with names, occupations, 
APP, Credit Rating, and any key aspects of their backstory 
that catch your attention. 

Key information can be summarized in a reference chart, 

using the format at the bottom of the page.

Avoid being unnecessarily harsh when reviewing inves-
tigators;  remember  that  regardless  of  how  skilled  or  well-
armed an investigator may appear to be, the monsters of the 
Cthulhu Mythos will always be more powerful.

Call of CthulhuCreating New Occupations
If none of the published list of professions fit your require-
ments when creating investigators, or if you simply prefer, 
just choose any combination of eight skills that best fit the 
investigator’s occupation. Don’t forget to determine a range 
for Credit Rating. This is a quick and easy method, allowing 
for spontaneity and speed.

Linking Investigators When Playing 
Subsequent Scenarios
The advice offered above for tying characters to the scenario 
may work well enough for their first adventure, however this 
can become labored if overused. If you are running unre-
lated  scenarios  with  the  same  investigators,  a  good  reason 
is  required  for  them  to  be  repeatedly  involved  in  foiling 
the  plots  of  the  Mythos.  A  deceased  uncle  is  all  very  well 
for one plotline, but what about next time? Just how many 
murdered relatives can one investigator have?  

Many  scenarios  are  conceived  and  written  as  an  inter-
esting  story,  with  the  investigators  added  on  afterwards. 
Some form of motivation must be chosen as a reason for the 
investigators to connect with the plot. 
Common motivations include:
G  Employment:  The  investigators  are  professionals 

available for hire.

G  A  social  connection:  A  friend  or  member  of  an 
investigator’s family, who is integral to the plot.
G  Personal gain: A chance to find fame or fortune.
G  Altruism:  Saving  others,  perhaps  even  saving  the 

world itself.

G  Moral  code:  Battling  evil  as  a  result  of  personal 

convictions.

The  investigator’s  background  is  there  to  help  in  this 
respect.  The  initial  backstory  written  by  the  players  serves 
to  build  their  characters  and  define  their  connections  to 
the world. The entries that you add or amend during play 
should  provide  connections  between  that  character  and 
the Mythos, especially those that are the result of madness. 
Try to word backstory entries in a way that might push the 
character to pursue the Mythos, such as:

G  An insatiable appetite for knowledge that man was 

not meant to know.

G  You cannot rest until the Cult of the Black Pharaoh 

is destroyed.

G  Every  night  you  dream  of  a  sunken  city;  you  hear 

voices calling your name.

G  The answer must lie in the Necronomicon.

Non-Player Characters 
(NPCs)
The players control their investigators; the Keeper controls 
everyone else in the world, known as non-player characters. 
These can come into the game in a number of ways.

You may find that players suggest ideas for non-player 
characters  when  making  their 
investigators:  relatives, 
colleagues,  friends,  or  enemies.  Refer  to  the  investigators’ 
backstories for these and take careful note of any details for 
later incorporation into the scenario.

Investigators  may  establish  contacts  during  the  game 

(see Contacts, page 97).

Your plot will include some key non-player characters—

the villains!

The  game  will  inevitably  lead  to  encountering  new 
non-player characters. Every street, every bar, every library 
has people in it for the investigators to talk to.

The important non-player characters in published sce-
narios will have their characteristics and a selection of skills 
already  drawn  up;  however,  there  are  always  non-player 
characters the investigators will wish to speak to in addition 
to those already prepared. You may need to come up with 
skills  and  characteristics  for  these  improvised  non-player 
characters as required  during play—and this can  easily be 
done. Of course, you will only need skills or characteristics 
for your non-player characters if they are opposing an inves-
tigator in some way—often you can just play the interaction 
without concern for any skill values or numbers.  

When an investigator makes a skill roll versus a non-play-
er character, you will need to establish whether the difficulty 
level for the player is Regular, Hard, or Extreme. To do this, 
consider the skill or characteristic being used in opposition 
by  the  non-player  character.  As  Keeper,  you  should  make 
a swift and arbitrary decision whether a particular skill or 
characteristic is a key aspect of that character’s profession. 
If the skill or characteristic directly relates to the non-player 
character’s  profession,  then  it  would  be  rated  at  50%  or 
higher, and thus the difficulty level should be Hard. If this 

Walter is creeping about in an old mansion when he 
hears someone coming and wants to hide. As the door 
opens, the Keeper asks for a Stealth roll. The Keeper 
figures  that  the  opposing  factor  would  be  the  Spot 
Hidden skill of the approaching non-player character. 
In this case the non-player character is a maid. The 
Keeper doesn’t have any statistics for the maid, but her 
profession does not imply or require a high Spot Hid-
den skill, thus the difficulty level is Regular (requiring 
a  roll  equal  to  or  less  than  the  investigator’s  Stealth 
skill).  If  the  person  entering  were  a  police  detective, 
the  difficulty  level  would  be  Hard  (requiring  a  roll 
equal  to  or  less  half  than  the  investigator’s  skill),  as 
Spot Hidden can be assumed to be a key aspect of the 
detective’s profession.

chapter 10: playing the gameis not the case, the skill is below 50%, so a Regular difficulty 
level is set. Only in truly exceptional circumstances should 
the difficulty level be set to Extreme (few non-player charac-
ters will have even a single skill of 90% or above).

If  combat  rolls  are  called  for,  arbitrarily  assign  some 
combat  values  on  the  spot:  average  Joe  (unskilled)  25%; 
barroom brawler or hired thug 40%; trained killer 70%.

While prepared non-player characters will be provided 
with notes for you to interpret, ad-hoc non-player charac-
ters won’t have their personalities and goals predetermined. 
How you play these characters is up to you, but if you wish 
to introduce a random element, refer to Non-Player Char-
acter Reactions to the Investigators (see following page).

Roleplaying Non-Player Characters
Roleplay  is  at  the  heart  of  this  game,  and  it’s  your  job  as 
Keeper  to  reinforce  this. While  the  players  get  to  play  one 
character  each,  you  get  to  play  everyone  else,  and  the  key 
thing is that you roleplay the non-player characters. Rather 
than  telling  the  players  what  they  learn  from  the  barman, 
take the role of the barman yourself. Try to alter your voice, 
perhaps  speaking  with  an  appropriate  accent  or  changing 
the  tone  and  volume  of  your  voice.  Don’t  be  afraid  to  act 
the part, using gestures and mannerisms to help the players 
build a mental image of the person they are interacting with. 
It’s common for players to view the Keeper as being in 
charge of the game and as such they will look to you for how 
to play, modeling their performances on yours. Some people 
are a little shy, but when they see and hear you talking “in 
character,”  they  will  feel  encouraged  to  do  likewise.  Teach 
by example and reward them for getting into the spirit of 
the game. If a player really gets into character and makes a 
strong argument, then you might reward the player by for-
going a Persuade roll, or at least lower the difficulty level of 
the roll. Don’t feel compelled to reward strong roleplaying 
every time;  roleplaying is enjoyable in itself and shouldn’t 
require constant reward.

When  possible,  try  to  bring  previously  established 
non-player  characters  back  into  play.  Doing  this  builds  the 
feeling of consistency and continuity. Consider how television 
shows do this. When investigators want to know the word on 
the street, they may visit the same bar where they are familiar 
with Bernie the barkeep. Ber-
nie soon becomes a character 
in his own right and his story 
becomes entwined with that 
of  the  investigators.  Plac-
ing  non-player  character 
contacts at risk will provide 
further  motivation  for  the 
players.  When  the  players 
hear  that  cultists  picked 
Bernie  the  barkeep  as  a 
sacrifice  to  their  dark  god, 
it’s going to be more mean-
ingful than if it were just an 
unknown victim.

Remember to 
present non-
player characters 
in a believable 
way. The use 
of accents and 
mannerisms can 
quickly establish 
a character’s 
personality in 
the minds of the 
players. 

Roleplaying Hooks
Everybody  wants  something.  Have  non-player  characters 
approach  the  investigators  with  requests,  demands,  and 
problems.  Consider  how  events  in  the  story  might  create 
problems  for  non-player  characters.  These  non-player 
characters will want help with their problems and, wherever 
possible,  you  should  direct  their  requests  for  help  to  the 
investigators.  If  a  non-player  character  has  something  the 
players  want,  the  non-player  character  will  probably  want 
something in return. 

As  an  aid  to  presenting  non-player  characters  in  play, 
list  two  or  three  of  these  “roleplaying  hooks”  alongside 
each of the key non-player characters in your scenario. The 
hooks  are  more  than  personality  traits  or  clues;  they  are 
plot drivers that allow the non-player character to hook an 
investigator like a fish on a line. Your players will soon be 
pulled in multiple directions by various hooks and if most 
of these hooks are rooted in your core plot then your story 
will become more layered and engaging. 

The Keeper has noted the following roleplaying hooks 
for Parkin Withers (NPC):

G  Parkin’s  business  (and  possibly  life)  is  under 
threat from the mob—he desperately needs help.
G  Parkin knows that Ephraim Smith is a cultist and 
will seek some form of reward or recompense from 
the investigators in return for this information.

Harvey  Walters  regularly  stops  to  chat  over  a 
drink  with  Parkin  Withers.  Harvey  wants  to  know 
how Parkin got his black eye, and Parkin explains how 
a  man  is  extorting  money  from  him.  Parkin  wants 
Harvey’s  help.  The  Keeper  knows  that  this  mystery 
man is tied in with  the plot, as part of a local gang 
associated  with  a  cult.  If  Harvey  takes  the  bait  and 
offers to help Parkin, the plot is progressed.

Parkin  also  possesses  information  pertaining  to 
Harvey’s investigation, but in return he wants a pack-
age delivered. “It’s nothing suspect, but whatever you 
do, don’t open it…”

Presenting the Authorities
The  Keeper  should  define  the  function  and  purpose  of 
a  given  authority  in  the  context  of  the  scenario.  A  sheriff 
or a judge, for instance, can be a great help or a great ob-
struction to an investigation; perhaps by controlling access 
to evidence, the non-player character may willfully pursue 
personal theories concerning a crime rather than cheerfully 
adopting the ideas of the investigators, and may even blindly 
order the arrest of the investigators as suspects, or hold them 
as material witnesses.

Uniformly portraying authorities as sleazy opportunists, 
corrupt fools, and rigid bumpkins enforces a cliché that can 
corrode the heart of the game. Call of Cthulhu assumes that 

190 

Call of Cthulhuhumanity  and  human  civilization  considers  itself  worth 
defending  and  saving.  However  bad  humanity  can  be,  the 
Mythos is far worse. Since investigators risk their lives to save 
such people, some authorities must be shown to be worth 
the struggle. The truth is that some are and some are not. 
If the investigators encounter authorities with well-rounded 
characters, freely capable of good and bad, they can make up 
their own minds about the value of society.

Non-Player Character Reactions to 
the Investigators
You decide how non-player characters react to an investiga-
tor; however, if you want to test the non-player character’s 
reaction  to  an  investigator,  you  can  make  a  concealed  roll 
using either the investigator's APP or Credit Rating. Which 
one you use is determined by the situation and the non-play-
er character; ask yourself whether wealth or looks is more 
likely  to  influence  the  particular  non-player  character?  If 
you are unsure, use the higher of the two. It’s a good idea to 
take note of each investigator’s APP and Credit Rating skill 
at the start of the game.

To perform the test, roll 1D100 and compare it to either 
the investigator's Credit Rating or APP. If the dice result is 
below the target number, the reaction is positive; otherwise 
the  reaction  is  negative.  How  you  portray  a  positive  or 
negative  reaction  in  play  is  up  to  you.  An  initial  negative 
reaction  should  make  the  investigator's  life  more  difficult, 
especially if the player’s intention is to befriend or influence 
the non-player character. This test is intended for use with 
non-player  characters  who  have  no  outstanding  reason  to 
like or dislike the investigator.

Harvey Walters  enters  a  police  station  late  at  night. 
The place is busy with arrested late-night brawlers and 
drunks. The Keeper wants to randomly determine the 
desk sergeant's reaction to Harvey; the desk sergeant is 
more likely to be impressed by wealth than looks and 
so  Credit  Rating  is  more  important  in  this  instance 
than APP. Harvey has a Credit Rating score of 41. The 
Keeper  rolls  83—well  above  41,  indicating  a  failure 
and thus a poor reaction. Harvey will get short shrift 
from this overworked and already agitated officer.

Playing Within the Limits of  
Character Knowledge
When  roleplaying  non-player  characters,  remember  that 
they  don’t  know  everything  that  you  know  as  Keeper.  It’s 
easy to make non-player characters infallible, but it can be 
a lot more fun to play up their flaws. Non-player characters 
can make mistakes, misunderstand, and fail just as readily as 
the investigators. Cultists are only human, so let them make 
human  mistakes  too.  Their  mistakes  may  serve  to  further 
confound the players, who may seek some rationale for the 
non-player characters’ curiously mistaken activities.

Using Props to 
Present NPCs
Games of Call of Cthulhu can feature a wide variety 
of  non-player  characters—that’s  before  we  even  get 
to the monsters! Keeping track of who’s who can be 
daunting for both the Keeper and the players. Prepar-
ing some simple props ahead of the game can help.

A  quick  and  easy  way  to  differentiate  between 
non-player characters is to find a portrait for each of 
them. Most published scenarios include a drawing or 
photograph of each of the important non-player char-
acters that the investigators will meet. Having a copy 
of these allows you to show the players who they are 
speaking to. If you are running a scenario of your own 
design or one where images of the non-player charac-
ters are not provided, a quick search on the Internet 
can provide a range of suitable character portraits for 
you to print and cut out. Try looking at websites fea-
turing people of the period in which the game is set. 
For example, galleries of 1920s film stars are available 
and provide a perfect resource for Keepers.

Prepare a List of Names
You will have to name non-player characters during play. It’s 
a good idea to have a list of names ready so that you can pick 
one with ease rather than fumbling around only to come up 
with a common name such as “Bob”. Fumbling for a name 
is  a  sure  sign  to  the  players  that  the  character  is  not  cen-
tral to the plot, and you should try to make all non-player 
characters feel equally real. Using names appropriate for the 
place and period gives an increased sense of realism. Once 
you’ve decided that the owner of the Castle Stahleck is called 
Fabian Azoth, you simply make a quick note alongside the 
name on your list for future reference.

Pick-Up Non-Player Characters
As  previously  stated,  players  play  their  investigators  and 
you play the non-player characters. Occasionally a situation 
may present itself in which it is possible to hand a group of 
non-player characters over to the players’ control, thus al-
lowing the non-player characters to be played by the players 
(temporarily replacing their investigators) for a time. 

191 

chapter 10: playing the game192 

Call of CthulhuThe  investigators  have  managed  to  persuade  the 
police  that  a  SWAT  team  is  required  to  assault  the 
cult’s hideout. Rather than simply telling the players 
the  outcome  of  the  operation,  the  Keeper  decides  it 
would be fun to allow the players to play members of 
the SWAT team for the duration of the mission. This 
is especially effective, since the role of the non-player 
characters  contrasts  with  that  of  the  investigators. 
Playing  a  combat-trained,  well-armed  professional 
provides  a  major  change  of  pace  to  a  player  whose 
investigator is a college professor.

Pick-up non-player characters don’t require a full char-
acter sheet; indeed, the less you give the player, the freer the 
player may feel. Sometimes it is easier to improvise around 
a simple archetype than to portray a fully detailed character. 
A simple index card with a name, profession and a few key 
characteristics or skills is enough for one scene—fill in any 
other statistics as they are called for. If it’s a combat scene 
then combat skills, weapons, and hit points should be de-
tailed in advance or quickly generated in play.

Playing a non-player character allows the player to “see” 
through the eyes of a character that is not his or her usual 
investigator and discover things that the player would oth-
erwise be unaware of. This conflict of knowledge happens 
all  the  time  in  roleplaying—every  time  the  investigators 
split up, a player may hear about things that are not being 
perceived through his or her investigator. The latter is easily 
overlooked as it can be generally assumed that fellow inves-

The Keeper gives the players some pick-up non-player 
characters  to  play—a  group  of  students  living  in  a 
shared house. The players don’t know anything about 
the house or the non-player characters, and they just 
play  the  characters  as  they  see  fit.  Only  one  scene  is 
played  out,  in  which  one  of  the  pick-up  non-player 
characters  is  possessed  (at  the  Keeper’s  direction)  by 
some supernatural force and murders his companions. 
The players love the scene as it is quick and gruesome! 
What’s more, their investigators are not under threat, 
so the players can relax and enjoy the action without 
fear that their main character will die.

The players then return to playing their investiga-
tors with no idea how the pick-up non-player charac-
ters link in with their story. However, while following 
up a future lead, the investigators are invited to din-
ner by a town councilor. While roleplaying the dinner 
scene, the Keeper drops hints to the players that this 
is  the  very  house  in  which  the  earlier  murder  scene 
took place. The players know what is happening but 
their  investigators  do  not—this  dichotomy  increases 
the tension. As the penny drops, the Keeper mentions 
how quiet the councilor has become and how his face 
changes as he takes hold of the carving knife…

tigators fill each other in on what they have discovered. How 
you  and  your  players  deal  with  knowledge  gained  when 
playing  pick-up  non-player  characters  is  up  to  you.  This 
technique of playing other characters can be used to build 
tension and boost the horror. 

Making the Most of the  
Investigator’s  Backstory
The  investigator  backstory  can  be  a  springboard  for  story 
development.  Consider  how  each  investigator’s  backstory 
could drive the story forward and provide plot inspiration. 
While some backstory entries could possibly link to the sce-
nario’s central plot, the majority are more likely to form the 
basis for subplots. The players will be more involved if you 
can weave such entries into the broad story of the scenario.

The  Keeper  reviews  Harvey  Walters’  backstory  and 
occupation, and considers how they might be brought 
into the game:

“Uncle Theodore, who inspired a love of archaeol-
ogy. Harvey will prove himself a better man than his 
uncle, who was driven mad by his obsessions.”

Given  that  the  scenario  features  the  mi-go,  the 
Keeper decides that one of Uncle Theodore’s artifacts 
could be a Mist Projector (see Chapter 13: Artifacts 
and Alien Devices). Perhaps after encountering the 
mi-go, Harvey might be given an INT roll to see if he 
recognizes the artifact.
“Journalist.”
Harvey  talks  to  a  publisher  about  his  idea  for  a 
story (based upon his encounters with the mi-go). The 
publisher  mentions  it  in  passing  to  another  author 
who suspects Harvey’s tale is more fact than fiction. 
Is  this  other  author  in  league  with  the  mi-go  or  a 
potential ally?

“Handsome, well-dressed and a little overweight.”
It is not so easy to see how this can be used. Per-
haps  Harvey’s  tailor  might  be  persuaded  to  disclose 
useful information regarding his other clients.

Corrupting Backstory Entries as a 
Result of Madness
The only way to hurt a man who has lost everything is to give 
him back something broken.
—Stephen Donaldson, The Wounded Land

When  preparing  a  scenario  (or  between  sessions),  think 
about  the  investigators’  backstories  and  how  the  entries 
might  be  corrupted,  undermined  or  distorted,  given  the 
likely events of the scenario. 

193 

chapter 10: playing the gameThis  is  a  game  of  horror,  and  horror  is  most  effective 
when it hits close to home. In Lovecraft’s story The Shadow 
over  Innsmouth,  the  threat  to  the  narrator’s  sanity  comes 
not from the terrible monsters he encounters but from the 
realization concerning his own bloodline.

Plan out your intentions regarding investigator backsto-
ries from the outset so that they can be woven into the story. 
When  a  backstory  entry  is  later  corrupted,  the  revelation 
will flow naturally and be more pertinent to both the player 
and the overall story.

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an appro-
priate entry in the middle of a game, so having a list of ideas 
prepared before the game can help, either tailored to specific 
investigators or just a general list that can be tweaked and 
handed out as needed. 

Each time an investigator experiences a bout of madness, 
you may add or amend a backstory entry on the investiga-
tor’s  sheet.  Corrupting  an  existing  backstory  entry  rather 
than  replacing  it  with  something  completely  new  can  be 
more effective in building the story, and serves to maintain 
a sense of continuity. Changing a backstory entry may have 
a direct effect on the investigator’s mind—the game reality 
has not changed; rather, the investigator has had a realiza-
tion concerning some aspect of it.

You are never compelled to amend backstory entries as 
a result of investigator insanity or injury. It may be that the 
game is in full flow and you do not wish to pause the action 
while you consider. Or it may be that you have changed an 
investigator’s  backstory  recently  and  do  not  wish  to  make 
any further alterations at the time. If you wish, you can delay 
the changes to allow yourself time to think, and then apply 
them before the next session of play.

The  Keeper  reviews  Harvey  Walters’  backstory  and 
considers  how  each  entry  might  be  amended  as  a 
result of insanity:

1. “Uncle Theodore, who inspired a love of archae-
ology. Harvey will prove himself a better man than his 
uncle, who was driven mad by his obsessions.”

Uncle Theodore could either turn out to be an evil-
doer, or Harvey could just believe him to be one as a re-
sult of paranoia. This entry could be corrupted to read, 
“Uncle  Theodore  is  a  bad  influence.  I  must  do  what 
I  can  to  save  his  soul,”  or “Uncle Theodore’s  artifacts 
present a danger to the world and must be destroyed!” 
or “Uncle Theodore is trying to recruit me as a cultist.”

2. “Fate. Looks for signs and omens.”
This could become “I begin to foresee the end of 
days,” or, “I have been chosen as a prophet and must 
tell people of what is to come.” Alternatively it might 
take a superstitious bent, “Careful not to tread on the 
cracks in the pavement.”

3. “Handsome, well-dressed and a little overweight.”
A love of good clothes speaks of a materialistic per-
son who takes pride in fashion and appearance. This 
may be altered to “Disdainful of material wealth,” or 
“Unaware of how ragged my clothes have become.”

Rolling Dice

Dice Rule 1: The Keeper decides when to call for a skill roll. 
You (as Keeper) decide on the difficulty level for each skill 
roll and, by extension, decide whether a skill roll is required 
at all. If the task is routine and no drama is involved then 
it doesn’t require a roll. There may be instances when you 
want the action to move on quickly or want to avoid adding 
complications  to  the  proceedings  and  allow  the  players  to 
do something difficult without a roll; as Keeper, this is your 
prerogative.

Dice Rule 2: Dice don’t tell stories; people do.
The  dice  do  not  decide  what  winning  or  losing  means  in 
your story; that’s the Keeper’s job. When a player wins a skill 
roll, his or her goal is achieved (as agreed before the roll), 
but when they lose, the Keeper decides what happens.

Dice Rule 3: Losing a roll doesn’t necessarily mean failing 
the goal.
There are two possible outcomes of a skill roll: win or lose. 
It  is  important  to  realize  that  losing  a  dice  roll  does  not 
automatically lead to failing the task. 

Things go the way the player wants when a Pushed skill 

roll is won (the player’s goal is achieved). 

When a player loses in a Pushed skill roll things go the 
way the Keeper wants (the goal may or not be achieved and 
additional negative consequences occur).

One  of  the  keys  to  running  a  good  game  is  learning 
to define how winning or losing a dice roll translates into 
events in your story. Describe the outcome, not the dice roll.
If the player loses the roll then you get to decide what 
happens. Problems can arise if you declare an outcome that 
blocks play.

194 

Call of CthulhuThe investigators are locked in a room that is rapidly 
filling with water and have no hope of rescue. Their 
only way out is through a locked door. Andrew sets a 
goal for his investigator to “Pick the lock on the door”. 
He fails and feels compelled to push the roll. He does 
not  request  any  foreshadowing—the  consequence  of 
being  trapped  underwater  is  self-evident.  He  loses 
a  second  time,  placing  the  outcome  in  the  Keeper’s 
hands. The group has only been playing for an hour 
and dying now would bring the session to a premature 
end. This presents a problem: the investigators are all 
going to drown if the door remains closed. The Keeper 
considers the options.

Devise  a  prompt  rescue  (which  may  feel  like  a 

contrivance). 

Allow for some additional rolls (which of course 
might  also  be  lost,  leaving  the  players  in  the  same 
situation).

Have the consequence of losing the Pushed roll be 
that the room fills with water, but just before everyone 
drowns,  Andrew’s  investigator  manages  to  open  the 
door and everyone is carried out on a wave of water.
Clearly  the  final  option  is  preferable.  The  in-
vestigators  should  take  some  damage  as  part  of  the 
consequence, but they survive and the game goes on. 
The player has achieved his goal, but at a significant 
cost because he failed the Locksmith roll.

Dice Rule 4: Dice are used to determine who tells the story.

On winning a skill roll, the player gets to say what happens 
next. What the player can say has already been agreed with 
the Keeper when the goal was set. If you feel that the player 
is overstepping the mark (going far beyond the stated goal) 
you may veto the player’s comments, perhaps calling for a 
subsequent dice roll.

If the player loses a dice roll, you have free rein to de-
scribe  any  outcome  you  wish.  Usually  this  will  mean  that 
the player’s goal is not realized; however, you are not con-
strained to presenting the opposite of the player’s goal—the 
player’s goal could be fully or partially achieved along with 
a consequence. The Keeper’s job is to create an interesting 
outcome, preferably one that develops the theme of horror 
in the story.

One way to think of this is to compare it to a football 
game  in  which  the  two  teams  battle  for  possession  of  the 
ball. In Call of Cthulhu the player and Keeper battle for “pos-
session” of the story. The side that wins the dice roll gets to 
run with the metaphorical ball for a while.

Dice Rule 5: Avoid consecutive rolls against the same skill.

Asking  a  player  to  make  a  skill  roll  more  than  once  for 
the  same  task  greatly  reduces  the  likelihood  of  the  player 
winning the roll. An investigator with a Stealth skill of 50% 
obviously  has  a  50%  chance  of  winning  (at  Regular  diffi-
culty level). If the player is asked to make this roll twice in 
succession, the chance of passing both rolls drops to 25%. 

Therefore, if there are three guard posts and each must be 
passed  to  enter  the  cult  base,  rather  than  asking  for  three 
consecutive Stealth rolls, you could call for one roll to cover 
all three, allowing the one winning roll to stand so that no 
further rolls will be required for a time. If you feel that there 
being three guard posts makes the task significantly harder 
then you can raise the difficulty level. 

Dice Rule 6: Roll dice in full view.

Both players and Keeper should roll the dice in full view and 
use the result as rolled. If you find that dice rolls bring un-
wanted consequences, you should read through Dice Rules 
1 to 4 again. The only exception to this is when the Keeper is 
making a “concealed roll,” such as for Psychology rolls (see 
Contacts, page 97).

Setting Difficulty Levels
The difficulty level of a given task should be the same for 
everyone and should not be altered according to the skill of 
the person attempting it. If the difficulty level for a climb is 
declared as being Hard it remains Hard regardless of wheth-
er one is a novice or an expert climber.  The skill percentage 
is  what  makes  the  difference;  the  person  with  the  greater 
Climb skill has a greater chance of winning the roll.

If you feel that a task is so easy that it would be routine, you 
can either not call for a roll (the task is simply accomplished) 
or you may ask for a roll at Regular difficulty (or give a Bonus 
die), but make the consequence of failure be very mild. 

A  routine  task  that  relates  directly  to  an  investigator’s 
occupation  should  be  achieved  automatically;  remember, 
only roll dice for important and dramatic reasons.

Harvey’s player is trying to open a puzzle-box. 

“Can I make an INT roll to try to open it”, the 

player asks. 

“What are you actually doing with the box?”, asks 

the Keeper, prompting the player to elaborate.

Harvey’s player thinks for a moment. “I’m going 
to spend a while studying the various symbols, per-
haps looking some of them up in my Uncle’s books, 
and  see  if  I  can  figure  out  how  to  turn  the  various 
sides until it opens.”

“Sounds good. OK, give me an INT roll”.
Notice  how  the  Keeper’s  question  coaxed  some 

extra description and story from the player.

Ask the Player
Ask questions of the players. Encourage the players to talk in 
terms of their investigators’ actions rather than using rules 
terminology.  When  a  player  proposes  an  action  by  asking 
to make a roll, ask questions about what the investigator is 
actually doing. It’s the Keeper’s job to ask the player to make 
a roll. Asking to make a roll does not convey the drama of 
the situation.

195 

chapter 10: playing the gameEncourage the players to describe the way in which their 
goals  are  achieved  when  they  win  the  roll.  Think  of  it  as 
shining a spotlight on the player and placing a microphone 
under  his  or  her  nose.  Don’t  be  unnecessarily  restrictive 
when it comes to what you allow a player to narrate. With 
a  goal  of “breaking  the  door  down,”  does  it  really  matter 
whether  the  player  describes  it  as, “I  force  the  door  with 
my shoulder until the latch pops off,” or “I charge the door, 
smashing it asunder, sending splinters of wood flying across 
the  room?”  If  it’s  a  matter  of  inconsequential  details  and 
the  player  has  enjoyed  describing  his  or  her  investigator’s 
actions, just smile and say, “Yes!” Try to avoid restating or 
rephrasing what the player just said—doing so is unneces-
sarily and may undermine the player’s contribution.

Some players may roll the dice and look at you to tell them 
what happens: “I rolled 14 to break down the door. That’s a 
success.  What  happens?”  Throw  the  question  back  and  en-
courage the player to elaborate. “Cool, tell us how you do it”.

Some players may go to the other extreme and describe 
everything  that  happens,  including  non-player  characters’ 
reactions  and  more.  How  far  you  allow  the  player  to  go 
when it comes to describing how their goal is achieved is up 
to you. You have veto if the player goes too far, and you will 
develop a feel for what “too far” means. 

Learn  to  differentiate  between  descriptive  color  and 
mechanical effect. How the player describes breaking down 
the door isn’t really important—it’s just color. The dice were 
rolled, the goal was achieved, and the door is broken down. 
From another point of view, this descriptive color is of ut-

Harvey  wins  a  skill  roll  to  break  a  door  down.  The 
player describes  Harvey’s actions thus: “I charge the 
door  and  smash  it,  sending  splinters  of  wood  flying 
across  the  room.  There’s  a  guard  there,  right?”  The 
Keeper  nods.  The  player  then  says,  “OK,  the  guard 
cowers and drops his weapon in surprise. I run over 
and  grab  the  gun  while  he’s  pulling  splinters  out  of 
his face!”

You  may  feel  that  the  player  has  gotten  a  little 
carried  away  here,  but  it’s  creating  good  story.  The 
Keeper decides to rewind the action a little to where 
the investigator is running at the guard, stating, “The 
guard sees you coming and makes a grab for his fallen 
weapon as he rolls away from you. Sounds like you’re 
trying to get it before him, right?”

Bang—it’s an exciting action scene. All that’s hap-
pened is that the player has achieved his goal of getting 
through the door and is now grappling the guard. The 
only  thing  that  the  player’s  description  really  added 
was that the guard has dropped his weapon and the 
Keeper  feels  this  is  acceptable  in  the  circumstances. 
The  guard  would  normally  have  to  draw  a  weapon, 
so either way the weapon is not in the guard’s hand at 
that moment. The whole thing about the splinters in 
the guard’s face is just color and has no effect on the 
dice or hit points.

Delusions can cause investigators to act irrationally.

most  importance,  as  it  is  this  description  that  builds  the 
story and makes the game more interesting and fun.

There  is  only  a  mechanical  effect  on  the  game  when 
the player goes beyond color and adds something that will 
affect future dice rolls. This is where you need to use your 
judgment on whether to accept, veto, or adapt the player’s 
description. If what the player asks for or describes  seems 
reasonable, you can allow it, but don’t make life too easy for 
the player—remember that this is a horror game. You can 
veto it, but where possible try to adapt it or offer an alterna-
tive rather than blocking the player’s suggestion. If you feel 
unsure whether to allow it or not, you can ask for a Luck roll. 

Pushing the Roll—Pushing the Horror
Sometimes,  a  player  will  simply  ask,  “Can  I  push  that?” 
Remember the advice—ask questions of the players. Players 
must always describe the extra effort or action their inves-
tigators  make  to  justify  a  pushed  roll—if  it  sounds  insuf-
ficient  then  suggest  what  more  might  be  done.  A  pushed 
roll should usually be possible, but events in the story must 
account for it. 

When  a  player  loses  a  pushed  roll,  he  or  she  is  giving 
you, the Keeper, license to make the investigators’ lives more 
difficult. You should think of a consequence that takes the 
investigators one step nearer to their doom. It may be some 
unexpected occurrence, perhaps even one that is unrelated 
to the subject of the skill roll.

The  consequence  should  be  more  than  failure.  Every 
time a player loses a pushed roll, you should try to steer the 
game  towards  the  theme  of  horror.  This  may  not  always 
be possible, but have that as your goal: a pushed roll is your 
chance to push the horror.

Call of CthulhuMatthew asks a hotel receptionist if a certain person 
has stayed at the hotel recently. After failing initially, 
he refuses to take no for an answer and offers a bribe. 
The  Keeper  grants  a  pushed  roll.  Thinking  fast,  the 
Keeper foreshadows the consequence: “Your persistence 
may cause offense, perhaps more.” It’s vague, but it’s 
what the investigator might expect. Matthew fails the 
pushed roll and the Keeper considers how to make life 
more difficult for the investigator and push the horror 
theme. Up to this point the Keeper had not considered 
the receptionist but, as a result of this pushed roll, the 
Keeper decides that the receptionist is allied with the 
investigator’s  enemies  and  will  inform  them  of  the 
investigator’s  enquiry.  To  increase  the  tension,  the 
Keeper  hints  at  this  within  the  consequence.  “The 
receptionist holds up his hands and with a slight smile 
says, ‘I’m sorry sir, I’ve never heard of this gentleman’. 
A few moments later, as you’re leaving the hotel, you 
see him speaking on the phone. You catch his eye and 
he looks away hastily.”

Notice that the receptionist had not been consid-
ered a threat until the player lost the pushed roll. It 
was only then that the Keeper changed the status of the 
receptionist, adding yet another pawn to the enemy.

Alternatively, if the investigator is insane at the time of 
losing the pushed roll then this presents a prime opportuni-
ty to introduce a delusion:

If  in  the  example  above,  Matthew’s  investigator  were 
insane,  the  Keeper  might  pick  an  alternative  conse-
quence, choosing to hit Matthew’s investigator with a 
delusion. “The receptionist is clearly losing his patience 
with you. He informs you again that he knows nothing 
of the person of whom you are enquiring. As he loudly 
states the name, you notice another guest staring hard 
at you. Something writhes beneath his shirt. His skin 
is slick with sweat, his eyes are fixed on you and he is 
mumbling  something  you  can’t  quite  make  out  and 
making  strange  movements  with  his  left  hand.”  In 
reality this is just another mundane guest at the hotel, 
however Matthew (the player) doesn’t know that and 
(suspecting  a  delusion)  asks  for  a  reality  check  (see 
Reality check rolls, page 162). He fails the roll, sending 
his investigator into a bout of madness. The Keeper de-
cides that, during his bout of madness, the investigator 
attacks the innocent bystander until he is restrained by 
hotel  staff,  who  then  summon  the  police. The  Keeper 
tells  Matthew  that  the  next  thing  his  investigator  is 
aware  of  is  lying  on  floor,  pinned  by  a  police  officer’s 
knee, while nearby a man’s beaten body is being attend-
ed to by hotel staff. He has a lot of questions to answer.

Verbal Conflicts
Verbal confrontations should be roleplayed at the table with 
much gusto and performance. However, when there’s a gen-
uine conflict, you will want to pick up the dice. See Charm, 
Fast Talk, Intimidate, and Persuade Skills: Difficulty Lev-
els (page 93) for further details.

You must decide when a non-player character can be co-
erced and when they cannot. It might require a pretty face, a 
threat, a bribe, and so on, but most people can be won over 
with the right approach. Even the most evil of cultists might 
be conned or succumb to threats or persuasion if the players 
somehow find the non-player character’s weakness. Always 
work within the confines of the story—the cult boss would 
not knowingly be persuaded of anything by someone who is 
clearly an enemy, but if the investigator inveigles their way 
into the cult, they might stand a chance.

Hasna has taken a cultist captive and tries to get him 
to reveal the cult’s plans. The Keeper asks what Hasna 
is  doing  to  elicit  information  from  the  cultist  and  it 
soon  becomes  clear  that  intimidation  is  being  used 
rather than persuasion. The cultist has low Intimidate 
and  Psychology  (both  below  50%),  so  the  difficulty 
level starts at Regular. Given the cultist’s motivation, 
the  Keeper  raises  the  level  of  difficulty  to  Extreme. 
There is a slim that chance the cultist will crack!

In  this  case,  Hasna’s  goal  is  possible  as  the  cultist 
is  relatively  ineffective;  however,  if  the  cultist  had  an 
Intimidate or Psychology skill over 50%, the initial dif-
ficulty level would be Hard, and by raising the difficulty 
level by two steps the goal would become impossible. In 
that case the cultist would not crack unless Hasna could 
do something to “up her game,” such as using threats of, 
or actual, violence (in the case of Intimidate). 

Violence and Sanity Rolls
Intimidation  may  use  threats  of  physical  violence.  One 
suggested consequence of losing a pushed Intimidation roll 
is to have the investigator unintentionally carry out his or 
her threat. The player may not want to shoot the non-player 
character in the kneecap, but pushing the roll can result in 
unwanted outcomes. The use of such violence in that situ-
ation would constitute torture, and the Keeper may wish to 
ask for Sanity rolls for the participating investigators.

Taking a life in a game is easy—we grew up doing it in 
make-up games as children, we do it in video games, we watch 
it on television, and so on. Actually doing it in real life is a 
whole other matter. You may wish to reflect this in your game 
by calling for a Sanity roll (SAN 0/1D6) when an investigator 
first kills a person, whether or not it is in cold blood.

Cold-blooded murder is especially difficult, and an in-
vestigator may find themselves incapable of doing it. Such 
callous behavior may require the player to fail a Sanity roll

chapter 10: playing the gamebefore they are able to pull the trigger on a fellow human 
being. There is, after all, a word for people who can carry out 
such  acts  without  flinching—psychopaths.  A  psychopath 
would  have  a  low  Sanity  and  thus  be  able  to  do  such  acts 
without their conscience stepping in to prevent them.

Pacing the Game
Your role is like that of an orchestra conductor: you set the 
tempo.  Giving  a  good  pace  to  the  game  can  be  essential, 
keeping everyone interested and excited. Some scenes have 
a  natural  end  and  the  game  progresses  organically;  others 
have  the  risk  of  becoming  overextended  and  dull.  Try  to 
keep things moving, but bear in mind that sometimes the 
players need a chance to catch their breath and review the 
situation.  Combats  and  chases  demand  fast-paced  action 
and  quick  decisions  from  yourself  and  the  players.  Some-
times the players may disagree about how to proceed. When 
two players get caught up in a discussion about whether to 
stay in the musty old cellar or to make a break for freedom, 
you can take a step back and give them time to talk and work 
things out. If the players are animated you can take that as a 
sure sign that they are enjoying the game. If players are argu-
ing about rules then you should offer arbitration; otherwise 
just sit back and rest your voice for a while.

If everyone is enjoying themselves, there’s no problem; 
however, if some players are getting bored or the discussion 
is becoming repetitive, you should move things on. Do what 
you  can  to  introduce  some  drama  and  push  the  players 
towards some form of action. For example, have a desperate 
non-player character call upon the investigators for aid. An-
other option is to discuss the likelihood of success of their 
various plans. Alternatively, if they are completely stuck or 
cannot agree on how to proceed, you can offer them an Idea 
roll (following page).

A key aspect of your job as Keeper is to build an atmo-
sphere of tension, and the way you pace the game is key to 
this. You may start with a low-key opening and take a slow-
boil  approach,  gradually  building  the  tension  as  the  game 
reaches  a  climax. Alternatively  you  may  kick  the  game  off 
with a bang, starting the story in medias res, guns blazing, 
then alternate between tense dramatic scenes and high-ac-
tion  scenes.  Keep  your  finger  on  the  pulse  of  the  game, 
allowing  it  to  slow  down  at  times,  but  always  be  ready  to 
draw a scene to a close and push the game on.

A one-off game should have a beginning, a middle, and 
an end, with escalating tension throughout. If the game is 
being  run  across  multiple  sessions,  a  different  structure  is 
required.  Rather  than  building  to  an  ending,  the  Keeper 
should have next session in mind. Try to end each session 
on a cliffhanger or some kind of revelation. Leave the players 
with  an  unanswered  question.  The  realization  that  things 
are about to take a turn for the worse or the investigators are 
in much deeper than they first thought can be a real driver. 
If none of these things are available for the session climax, 
then a blood-pumping combat scene or chase can provide 
a great ending. 

The majority of roleplaying games are based upon acqui-
sition of skills and stuff, whereas Call of Cthulhu is a game of 
attrition. Be mindful when pacing or planning sessions that 
the effect of the horror genre on characters is different from 
that of a standard fantasy adventure game. In the latter the 
characters may be fighters and wizards exploring dungeons, 
accruing experience, wealth, and power as they do so. They 
may risk life and limb with every fight, but they soon recover 
and  grow  more  effective  as  the  game  progresses.  Contrast 
this with characters in a horror story, who rarely increase in 
effectiveness and for whom each challenge chips away at their 
physical and mental resources, with injuries taking consider-
able  time  to  heal. A  low-level  monster  may  cease  to  be  the 
threat  that  it  was  for  experienced  characters  in  some  other 
games, but a low-level monster in Call of Cthulhu remains a 
threat no matter how experienced an investigator becomes.

Take  note  of  how  your  players  react  to  events  in  the 
game. If they are blasé about the dangers their investigators 
face then increase the threat level. If the reverse is true and 
they  are  cautious  about  every  minor  action,  so  suspicious 
that they never accept a drink from a non-player character 
or spend ages planning for every eventuality, this may be a 
product of previous gaming experiences in which the games 
moderator was overly harsh. If this is the case, you should 
ease  off  a  little  or  reassure  them  when  the  risks  they  are 
taking are reasonable.

Problems With Players
Solving all potential problems between players is beyond the 
scope of this book. As Keeper, you are responsible for more 
of the game than an individual player, however you should 
not  feel  that  everything  is  your  responsibility.  Whether  a 
game goes well or not is due to your whole gaming group, 
not just you. If problems arise then be ready to stop and talk 
to your players if you feel the need to do so.

If  you  feel  that  one  person  is  dominating  the  game, 
encourage the quieter players to participate. Imagine your 
players are actors on the stage and you are in control of the 
spotlight;  by  addressing  questions  to  different  players  you 
are shifting the light from one player to another.

One investigator can’t be present in more than one place 
at one time, though some players will attempt to have their 
investigator be omnipresent. If this is an issue then be clear 
about  where  investigators  are—you  may  even  consider 
using  a  map  and  counters  to  clearly  illustrate  investigator 
location. If one player’s counter is in the kitchen and anoth-
er is in the attic, then when dealing with the investigator in 
the attic you shine the spotlight on and speak to that player 
only—remind the other player of the situation if he or she 
attempts to butt in.

Handling a group of people is an important skill for a 
Keeper to learn. Hopefully everyone is enthusiastic and full 
of ideas, but if they all speak over each other you will have 
chaos.  Focus  is  the  answer.  Focus  your  attention  on  only 
the players who are in the present scene and ask the other 
players to be patient. Remember you can cut from one scene 
to another whenever you want, but you must take control of 

198 

Call of Cthulhuthis and be aware that you are doing it. 

If  the  investigators  have  split  up,  be  clear  about  which 
investigators  are  at  the  present  scene.  Resolve  the  scene  or 
bring it to an interesting point, perhaps at a moment of great 
conflict, then cut to the other investigators and do the same 
for them. Don’t leave any single player inactive for too long. 
Consider the structure of television drama and place yourself 
in the role of director; you get to call “action” and “cut”. 

Usually  you  will  have  multiple  investigators  in  a  given 
scene. Talk to the players who are involved in the scene and ask 
questions about what each investigator is doing. Do not allow 
a player to dictate the actions of another player’s investigator. 
If one player states that another player’s investigator is doing 
something, turn to the player of that other investigator and 
ask them what they are doing. Remember that not everything 
relies  on  consensus.  If  an  investigator  is  holding  a  grenade 
and the player states, “I’m pulling the pin,” then it is pulled 
regardless of what the other players might say. A player might 
attempt  to  interfere  in  the  activity  of  another  investigator 
through the actions of their own investigator, but one player 
cannot declare the actions of another player’s investigator.

should  seek  a  balance  between  spoon-feeding  clues  to  the 
players and being overly secretive; this may sound easy, but 
it is not. Invariably the players will misinterpret or simply 
forget  clues  that  are  required  for  the  game  to  progress.  It 
may be that as your story unfolds you are unable to provide 
a certain important clue to the players. This may cause the 
game to stall and the fear of this happening can be a source 
of anxiety among Keepers and players alike. A dice roll to 
allow the investigator to gain a clue is all very well, but what 
if  the  players  lose  the  roll?  Do  you  just  ask  them  to  make 
another roll and another until they succeed?

This is where the Idea roll comes in. The players will get 
the clue regardless of whether they pass the Idea roll or not. 
An Idea roll is a highly significant and unusual event in the 
game. The roll determines not if, but how they get the clue. 
The goal of an Idea roll is always “to get the investigation 
back on track”. The Keeper starts by figuring out which was 
the most important clue the players missed and uses this to 
set a difficulty level for the Idea roll as follows. One player 
(whose investigator has the highest INT) then rolls dice for 
the Idea roll:

Running With What the Players 
Throw at You
Your players may well take an approach to the story that you 
have not thought of or planned for. Many Keepers will be 
tempted to block the players’ progress, simply saying no and 
steering the players back towards the story that the Keeper 
has prepared. Instead of that, where possible, try to incor-
porate  the  players’  suggestions,  especially  if  you  can  add 
complications of your own to their contribution. Wherever 
possible you should try to have an attitude of “Yes, and…” 
or “Yes, but…” rather than a flat “No”.

An investigator decides to make a telephone call to the 
local police. The Keeper has three options:

No: The Keeper could tell the players that they are 
the investigators and that it is not in the spirit of the 
game for them to call the police. This is clearly not a 
pleasing option for anyone.

Yes, and…: Rather than blocking the action, the 
Keeper might tell how the phone line is cut off or the 
police station unobtainable, or that only strange un-
earthly voices can be heard on the line.

Yes, but…: Perhaps a policeman turns up prompt-

ly, but he is corrupt and in league with the cult.

The Idea Roll
The players’ perception of the game world is formed by what 
you  tell  them;  they  cannot  perceive  what  is  in  your  head, 
only  what  you  say.  The  players’  next  step  in  a  game  may 
seem obvious to you but elude the players themselves. You 

i If the Keeper never mentioned the clue, the difficulty 
level is Regular (requiring the player to roll equal to 
or less than their investigator’s INT). The likelihood 
of winning this roll is high—it is hardly fair to ex-
pect the players to act on something that they don’t 
know about.

i  If the clue was definitely mentioned (but not em-
phasized), the difficulty level of the Idea roll is Hard. 
The players have had the chance to pick up on this 
clue and missed it. If weeks of real world time have 
passed  since  the  clue  was  mentioned,  you  might 
want to use Regular difficulty level for this. This is 
the default difficulty level for an Idea roll.

i  If  the  clue  was  made  clear  by  the  Keeper  (i.e. 
mentioned  several  times)  or  the  players  discussed 
it  themselves,  the  difficulty  level  of  the  Idea  roll  is 
Extreme. 

The setting of difficulty levels for Idea rolls may appear 
counterintuitive;  the  more  obvious  a  clue  was  made,  the 
more  difficult  the  Idea  roll  is.  The  Keeper  is  not  trying  to 
figure  out  the  likelihood  of  the  investigators  realizing  the 
clue—this  is  something  they  are  incapable  of,  as  fictional 
characters. The Keeper is offering the players a gamble, ask-
ing them to risk the negative consequences to gain the clue. 
A part of the role of players is to take note of clues during 
the game. There is a balance between the Keeper giving clues 
out  and  the  players  taking  clues  in.  The  Idea  roll  aims  to 
reflect  this  balance.  If  the  clue  has  never  been  mentioned, 
the balance must be redressed in the players’ favor and this is 
achieved by giving the players a strong chance of getting the 
clue for free. If the clue has been made obvious but some-
how missed by the players, the players have had their chance 
and so they are owed no redress, and thus the Idea roll is set 
to Extreme difficulty level.

chapter 10: playing the gameWinning the Idea Roll
If the players win the Idea roll, the Keeper should deliver the 
clue. The information should be enough to get the story going 
again with a strong direction. The Keeper should weave the 
delivery of the “idea” into the story rather than simply giving 
out the information. If the clue was never mentioned at all, 
some creativity is required in how the players attain the clue. 
When  an  Idea  roll  is  made,  the  Keeper  has  complete 
control of the situation and can move time on or place the 
investigators  in  whatever  situation  is  judged  appropriate; 
however, you should not increase their level of danger as the 
result of a winning roll.

The  investigators  visited  a  second-hand  bookshop 
when  researching  a  cult.  They  went  to  the  shop  be-
cause they found an occult tome with a bookmark on 
which was written the shop’s name. The investigators 
had  hoped  to  find  yet  more  tomes.  Unknown  to  the 
players,  the  shop  is  run  by  the  cult,  and  the  investi-
gators had seen the shopkeeper previously but failed 
to recognize him during their visit. The Keeper called 
for  a  Spot  Hidden  roll  at  the  time  to  see  if  anyone 
recognized  the  shopkeeper, thinking that  it might be 
interesting  if  the  investigators  didn’t  recognize  him. 
With the benefit of hindsight, this was an error. 

Now,  two  sessions  later,  the  investigators  have 
exhausted their leads and have requested an Idea Roll. 
The Keeper agrees, considers what lead to give them 
and  decides  that  the  second-hand  bookshop  offers  a 
strong link to the plot, being a key location for the cult.
The players never spoke to or discussed the shop-
keeper,  even  though  the  Keeper  mentioned  him  a 
couple of times, so that calls for a Hard difficulty level. 
The player with the highest INT throws the dice and 
rolls under half their Idea score—a win.

The Keeper tells the players how the investigators 
sit  together,  going  over  all  their  research  and  clues. 
“You decide to check out all the previous leads again. 
Ten days later you find yourself (addressing a partic-
ular player) back in that bookshop on Charing Cross 
Road. Remember that? There are quite a few custom-
ers in there this time and one of them is chatting to the 
shopkeeper. You recognize him from when you spied 
on  the  cult  meeting—he  was  there  too!  Fortunately 
he hasn’t spotted you and you can slip out unseen if 
you wish.”

This  will  probably  be  enough  to  get  the  game 

moving again.

Losing the Idea Roll—In the Thick of It
If the players lose the Idea roll they find themselves in deep 
trouble. A lost Idea roll gives the Keeper permission to put 
any of the investigators (regardless of who rolled dice) in the 

“thick  of  things.”  The  Keeper  should  consider  the  clue  on 
offer and try to come up with the worst situation in which 
the investigators might realize it. The Keeper starts the game 
again in medias res and the players must deal with the situa-
tion in which they find themselves.

You may well find that your group never resorts to using 
the Idea roll. Indeed, you may find that your group is never 
at a loose end and always have some ideas of their own as to 
how the story might proceed. Alternatively, the players may 
get stuck, but be so cautious that they refuse to call for an Idea 
roll. If this is the case, you can draw the current chapter of the 
game to a close and carry out investigator development phase 
(rolling skill improvement and so on). Then ask the players 
what their likely courses of action might now be. If you feel 
the  players  lack  direction,  you  should  insist  on  starting  the 
next part of the game with an Idea roll, using it to determine 
whether things restart well for the investigators or not.

Using the previous example, what if the Idea roll had 
been lost? The Keeper has identified a clue to give to 
the players (the shopkeeper and his link to the cult). 
The Keeper states, “You spend four weeks [Note: time 
has  been  wasted—that’s  part  of  the  consequence  of 
losing  the  Idea  roll]  going  over  previous  leads  and 
come up with nothing. As you sit in a café, you glance 
across the street and notice a bookshop that you rec-
ognize. You finish your coffee and make your way to 
the shop, intending to have another look to see if they 
have any rare tomes. You spend a while perusing the 
shelves  and  pay  little  heed  as  more  customers  enter 
the shop. Suddenly a glint of metal catches your eye 
and you realize that the customers in the shop are ap-
proaching you with curved daggers drawn! Glancing 
around you see the shopkeeper closing the blinds and 
turning the ‘Open’ sign to ‘Closed’.”

Note that the players don’t get to act or interject 
until you allow them to, at which point  the players 
are back in the story. As this scene is played out the 
Keeper makes every effort to yield sufficient informa-
tion  to  the  players  to  put  them  back  on  track.  The 
players now know the shop is run by the cult.

Luck for Non-Player Characters
If  you  decide  ahead  of  time  that  the  players  will  meet  the 
arch-villain in a warehouse, and that the investigators will 
neither  catch  nor  kill  him,  then  you  have  already  scripted 
the  events  and  the  players  will  be  no  more  than  pawns  in 
your story. Remember, Call of Cthulhu centers on a shared 
story  created  by  both  the  Keeper  and  the  players.  Avoid 
predetermining events in which the players will be involved.
However,  let  us  assume  you  want  to  do  your  best  to 
keep the arch-villain alive or out of the investigators’ hands. 
One way to achieve this outcome is to give the arch-villain 
a Luck pool—this does not guarantee escape, but it greatly 
increases the villain’s effectiveness and improves the chances

Call of Cthulhuwill know if intruders broke in through the study window 
(which you can decide has a flowerbed  outside), in which 
case there is indeed mud on the carpet!

When disseminating information, try to restrict yourself 
to describing evidence as found and leave it up to the players 
to deduce what has happened. You might inform the players 
that there was mud on the carpet, but avoid explaining the 
reason for it. 

Leaving  areas  of  doubt  and  uncertainty  is  essential  to 
promoting a sense of intrigue among the players. Fear finds 
fertile  ground  in  ignorance,  uncertainty,  and  doubt.  Just 
tell the players what their investigators perceive and let the 
players make their own deductions.

The  investigators  shoot  a  monster,  avoid  saying,  “It’s 
dead”. Simply inform the players that they cannot perceive 
any signs of life. Now the players are uncertain—is the thing 
dead  or  alive? A  First Aid  or  Medicine  roll  will  determine 
whether a person is alive or dead for certain.

The investigators search a room and fail their Spot Hid-
den roll. Avoid saying, “There’s nothing there”. Tell the players 
they  have  not  found  anything.  Now  they  are  wondering  if 
they missed something. Pushing the Spot Hidden roll would 
allow them to know if they have missed a clue or not.

The players will think of avenues of investigation that will 
surprise  you.  Be  creative  and  try  to  incorporate  their  ideas 
and allow leads to manifest wherever it makes sense for them 
to do so. A player may think to look through the bookshelves 
of the study for a family tree; the text of the scenario may not 
list the presence of a family tree, but such a thing might be 
quite feasible, so reward this idea and build on it. Remember 
the principle of “Yes, and…” and “Yes, but…”.

Yes, and…: The family tree is inscribed inside a family 

bible along with some other useful hints.

Yes,  but…: You  don’t  want  the  players  to  discover  the 
clue so easily, in which case, rather than simply not finding a 
family tree on the shelves, perhaps the investigator finds the 
family bible from which the first few pages have been torn 
out or certain names erased. 

Either of these options foster further investigation and 
are  preferable  to  the  simple  blocking  statement, “No,  you 
can’t find a family tree.”

Flying polyps are very dangerous Mythos beings.

of  any  escapes  performed  within  the  rules  (see  Spending 
Luck, page 99).

If you have an important non-player character (especial-
ly in a campaign) who is likely to crop up numerous times, 
then you may provide that non-player character with a Luck 
pool equal to his or her POW. This can be spent to affect dice 
rolls, but the pool is not replenished—thus it might be used 
to cause mayhem and allow an escape, although eventually 
the non-player character’s luck will run dry.

One  of  the  reasons  for  restricting  the  use  of  Luck  for 
non-player characters is that many non-player characters will 
only appear once, and thus could easily spend all their luck 
there and then, making them very powerful during the short 
time that they are in play. Non-player characters who appear 
multiple times will have a reason to reserve their Luck.

Disseminating Information
Expect  the  players  to  investigate  and  ask  questions.  That 
statement may sound obvious; however, these investigations 
will lead the players to ask questions regarding matters you 
have not considered. If there has been a murder, for exam-
ple,  you  need  to  have  a  clear  vision  of  what  has  occurred 
at the scene. You also need to decide how the murder took 
place.  A  player  may  ask  if  there  are  muddy  footprints  on 
the study carpet, whether there are any witnesses, or if the 
murder weapon has been thrown in the trash. If you have 
a  good  grasp  of  how  events  unfolded,  you  can  provide  a 
reliable  answer,  even  to  unanticipated  questions. You  may 
not  have  considered  a  certain  detail  previously  and  hence 
don’t instantly know if there is mud on the study carpet, for 
example. Since you know how the murder took place, you 

Perception Rolls
There are three main perception skills in Call of Cthulhu:

i  Spot Hidden: Chiefly visual observation, though it 

can also be used for smell or taste.

i  Listen: Perceiving and identifying sounds.
i  Psychology:  Understanding  the  motivations  and 

intentions of another person.

If a player succeeds in a roll for a perception skill, some 
information pertinent to the scenario should be forthcom-
ing (referred to as a clue).

The Keeper will usually be the one to ask for perception 
rolls, however sometimes a player may request one if his or 
her investigator is actively searching for a clue, for example 

201 

chapter 10: playing the gameThe main goal for investigators is to find out what is happening.

exploring a room (Spot Hidden) or attempting to determine 
if someone is lying (Psychology). 

Avoid  having  a  single  concealed  clue  that  is  the  key  to 
the  whole  adventure—despite  the  Keeper’s  best  efforts, 
the players could miss it, especially in a scenario in which 
the location of the key clue may be bypassed. A variety of 
strategies exist. You can ensure that important information 
is accessible in several ways. The information need not be 
precisely the same or appear in the same manner; however, 
it should be enough to point the investigators in the right 
direction. If ultimately they do miss the clue, don’t worry—
you always have the Idea roll (page 199) to fall back on. 

Clues are divided into two categories: obvious clues and 
obscure clues. You decide which prior to the dice being rolled. 

Obvious Clues
If  you  have  something  you  want  the  players  to  find  out 
about, you should make the clue obvious. Obvious clues are 
useful if your game is plot-driven, especially when missing 
such a clue would leave the players at a loss for how to pro-
ceed.  The  players  are  not  required  to  roll  dice  to  uncover 
obvious clues. 

There  may  be  obvious  clues  and  obscured  clues  at  the 
same  location.  It  might  be  obvious  that  a  book  has  been 
moved by the dust marks on the desk, but the single blonde 
hair  lying  in  the  dust  might  go  unnoticed.  The  first  piece 
of information—that the book was moved—is an obvious 
clue, while the blonde hair is an obscured clue.

If the clue is likely to be perceived by just one player among 
the group, it is up to you who you give it to; perhaps the player 
who has been least actively involved in the game, or the player 
of the investigator with the highest Spot Hidden score.

The investigators are looking for a cultist in the town. 
The Keeper has prepared a cool scene that takes place 
in a haunted house; however, the players don’t know 
about  it  yet.  The  Keeper  wants  the  investigators  to 
recognize the skulking cultist and be led to the house. 
Treating  this  as  an  obvious  clue,  the  Keeper  tells 
Harvey’s  player  that  her  investigator  spots  a  suspi-
cious-looking  man  heading  down  a  back  alley.  To 
everyone’s surprise, the player shouts out, “Stop that 
man!” and Harvey sprints off in pursuit before any of 
his fellow investigators can stop him. 

Obscured Clues

Finding an obscured clue may help the investigators in some 

way,  but  is  not  pivotal  to  progressing  the  plot.  If  you  feel 

that either option, getting the clue or not getting the clue, 

would allow the game to proceed in an interesting direction, 

you can use an obscured clue. When the players request a 

perception roll, you should generally use an obscured clue.

Obscured clues serve two functions:

i The chance to gain useful information.

i To create tension when the players miss the roll and 

know they have missed a clue. 

202 

Call of CthulhuResolving a Perception Roll For an 
Obscured Clue
Each  investigator  that  could  potentially  perceive  the  clue 
should  make  a  perception  roll  (Spot  Hidden,  Psychology, 
Listen,  or  a  combination  thereof).  Decide  on  a  difficulty 
level and declare it before the players roll. The information 
is given to the player with the highest level of success that 
meets or exceeds the difficulty level. In the case of a tie, the 
clue is perceived simultaneously by multiple investigators or 
by the investigator with the highest skill (Keeper’s choice).

Obscured perception rolls, when lost, have a second func-
tion—to provide a clear sign to the players that the investiga-
tors have missed a clue. Note that there is a dissonance here 
between  player  knowledge  and  investigator  knowledge.  The 
players know for certain there is a clue that has been missed, 
but the investigators should be unaware of anything they failed 
to  perceive.  The  players  now  have  three  options,  and  which 
they choose is a matter of personal preference and style of play:

Ignore it: Play strictly within the bounds of the investiga-
tor’s knowledge.

Push it: Have an investigator act on a hunch and take action 
that justifies a pushed perception roll, actively using percep-
tion skills in an attempt to get the clue.

Act on it: The player may pre-emptively guess what the clue 
is and act on it, rather than risk the consequences of losing 
a pushed perception roll. Of course they may have leapt to 
the wrong conclusion.

Consequences of Losing a Pushed 
Perception Roll
Regardless  of  who  called  for  the  perception  roll  and  why, 
the player may push the roll if it can be justified through the 
investigator’s actions. Perception rolls may be used in many 
different  situations  and  there  are  many  different  potential 
consequences of losing a pushed roll. 

Here are a few ideas of what may go wrong when losing 

a pushed perception roll:

G  The investigators waste time searching and in that 

time enemies arrive.

G  Evidence of a search is left; items are broken or are 

replaced out of order.

G  A foe creeps up to ambush the investigator while he 

or she is searching.

G  The  investigator  causes  offense  or  suspicion  by 

studying the target too closely.

G  That thing you were listening for? It heard you and 

it is coming!

The investigators have followed a cultist into  an  old 
house.  The  Keeper  decides  the  cultist  has  hidden 
in  the  master  bedroom  and  that  he  has  left  a  blood 
trail—will the investigators notice it? The Keeper can 
foresee some interesting events happening either way; 
the players are set to explore the house anyway, and 
not getting the clue is not going to spoil anything. This 
information would give them an advantage, though, 
and the Keeper decides to treat it as an obscured clue,  
asking for Spot Hidden rolls with a difficulty level of 
Hard because the players are using only one flashlight 
between them. 

All  the  players  miss  the  roll  and  they  don’t  see  the 
blood  trail.  The  tension  is  raised—the  players  know 
they have missed a clue. The investigators may choose to 
leave the house, or they may choose to spend more time 
searching, allowing the players to push the Spot Hidden 
roll. The consequences of missing the pushed roll could be 
that the investigators take damage from an ambush, or 
provide time for the cultist to make his escape.

Using More Than One Perception Skill 
Which skill to use for perception can be open to question, 
depending on the situation. If a non-player character is about 
to draw a weapon to attack an investigator, the player might 
make a Spot Hidden roll to see the weapon being drawn or a 
Psychology roll to become aware of the non-player charac-
ter’s intention. In this case, allow the player to make one dice 
roll using the higher of the investigator’s two skills.

Harvey  is  a  guest  of  Lord  Foxton,  who  has  chosen 
to  drug  Harvey’s  coffee.  The  Keeper  wants  to  give 
Harvey  a  chance  to  notice  this  and  offers  a  percep-
tion roll. The Keeper allows Harvey’s player to make 
a  combined  dice  roll,  comparing  her  rolled  result  to 
both Spot Hidden and Psychology. If the roll is made 
using Psychology, Harvey would pick up Lord Foxton’s 
anxiety and sense that something is wrong. If it were 
made  using  Spot  Hidden,  Harvey  would  notice  that 
his coffee smells a little strange.

Player Goals For Perception Rolls
Usually  the  goal  for  a  perception  roll  is  simply “to  find  a 
clue”;  however,  a  player  may  create  a  more  specific  goal, 
such  as “I  want  to  search  the  room.  I’m  hoping  to  find  a 
diary or journal that will give some information regarding 
the whereabouts of the person we’re looking for.” If you are 
happy that such a book could be found in the room, accept 
the goal and allow the player to roll the dice. If not, modify 
the goal accordingly or apply the “nothing there” technique 
outlined below.

203 

chapter 10: playing the gameNothing There?
Don’t be tempted to call for Perception rolls when there is 
nothing  to  find.  Remember  that  the  default  goal  of  a  Per-
ception roll is always “to find a clue”—if there is no clue to 
find then there is no roll to be made. The clue, whatever it is, 
should be notable, something that adds an interesting new 
twist or aspect to the story. 

If  a  player  requests  a  Spot  Hidden  roll,  you  may  allow 
one  even  if  there  is  no  clue  present.  The  goal  should  be 
phrased  as “to  look  for  a  clue”  or  if  looking  for  a  specific 
item, perhaps “to look for Jefferson’s journal,” for example. 
If the goal is achieved, the player will discover that the clue 
or item is definitely not present at the scene.

Psychology
If  a  player  passes  a  Psychology  roll,  the  truth  should  be 
revealed. If the roll is lost, you may be tempted to deceive 
the player, but if you automatically do this every time, the 
player (who knows because they lost the dice roll) will know 
that  the  opposite  is  true!  Therefore,  rather  than  feeling 
compelled to inform the player of the opposite of what is 
true, you are free to tell the player whatever you like—the 
difference being that the player won’t know if the informa-
tion is reliable.

Harvey is showing a photo of his missing friend to the 
barman, “Have you seen this guy?” The Keeper tells 
how the barman glances at it then goes back to wiping 
a glass and stating, “Never seen him before in my life.” 
Harvey’s player requests Psychology roll to tell if the 
barman is lying; she fails the roll. The Keeper smiles, 
“Well, he seems to be telling the truth.”

Harvey’s  player  now  feels  sure  that  the  barman 
is  lying  but  she  is  not  certain.  Should  she  press  the 
matter, perhaps offering a bribe or a threat? 

Handouts
Player  handouts  are  a  common  feature  of  Call  of  Cthulhu 
games.  These  are  usually  given  to  the  players  when  their 
investigators have found some important information, such 
as a letter or excerpt from a book. Published scenarios often 
reprint (or make available online) such handouts, allowing 
Keepers to print or cut them out for use in the game.

For example, a handwritten letter from an anonymous 
informer,  a  map  showing  the  location  of  the  tomb  of  an 
ancient  wizard,  or  a  newspaper  article  detailing  sightings 
of the Sasquatch could each be presented to the players as 
handouts. 

Handouts  serve  several  functions.  One  is  sensory:  a 
lovingly  crafted  handout  helps  to  boost  the  sense  of  im-
mersion  in  the  story.  Another  is  information.  A  handout 
is a convenient way to give out clues and information that 

can be retained by the players for later reference. A handout 
can also shift the focus from you and onto the person you 
hand it to. If the handout is for everyone then encourage the 
player to read it aloud.

Some  Keepers  prefer  to  create  their  handouts  from 
scratch, whether for a published or a home-brew scenario. 
These can be works of art in themselves. Simple techniques 
can  be  used  to  great  effect,  such  as  writing  letters  with  a 
fountain pen, or using an old, worn notebook, wherein the 
Keeper has prepared suitable pages. Coffee  can be used to 
stain the paper to give a timeworn effect. A piece of clothing 
from a charity shop (like a glove or torn shirt) can be em-
bellished with fake blood so that the Keeper can present it to 
the players when their investigators are searching the scene 
of some dark activity.

Photographs of the period in which the scenario is set 
can  be  useful  in  showing  locations  and  people.  Postcards 
from antique fairs might also be used. 

If the setting is more modern, the Keeper might prepare 
a sound file to be played when a recorded message is discov-
ered, or perhaps a short video appropriate to the scenario. 
The possibilities are endless; whole “dummy” websites could 
be created for the purpose of a specific investigation.

Whether  you  have  time  to  create  such  handouts  from 
scratch, go searching for them or simply use the ones pro-
vided  in  published  scenarios,  the  use  of  handouts  greatly 
complements  the  game.  Have  fun  and  see  what  you  can 
come up with.

Listen to what the players say and how they respond. If 
they are excited when you bring out a floor plan with count-
ers or miniatures to map the action then do it more often. 
If  they  study  every  detail  of  each  handout  then  use  more 
of them. Usually you’ll have a mix of players and they will 
respond to a mix of approaches. Don’t sweat it; keep things 
in balance and just try to make a good game.

Using the Rules
The rules in this book are intended to be flexible enough to 
cope with every eventuality.
The rules, in brief, are:
Regardless of the situation, the player’s intention defines 
the goal, and a skill or characteristic is chosen that best suits 
the situation. 

If the situation is reliant upon on external circumstances 
rather than an investigator’s actions then a Luck roll is used.

A Guide to Using the Rules for           
Specific Situations
Here are some examples of goals and how a Keeper might 
use the rules to resolve them. These are not spot rules and 
are only provided as suggestions to help Keepers understand 
how skill rolls can be used with a variety of goals.

Winning at a casino: 

Most  games  at  a  casino  are  based  on  luck;  however,  the 
odds are always stacked in favor of the house, so a straight 

204 

Call of CthulhuLuck roll would be generous. Perhaps this is one situation in 
which you could ask for a roll against half the investigator’s 
Luck score. A custom rule might be appropriate if you want 
to simulate the feeling of gambling. You might decide to call 
for  three  Luck  rolls  over  the  course  of  the  evening  at  the 
casino and set out the possible outcomes before rolling. Let 
the player nominate the stakes they are risking. If the player 
wins all three Luck rolls, he or she wins big, multiplying the 
stake by ten. If two out of three are achieved, the player wins 
a little. If one is achieved, the player breaks even. If all three 
are lost, the player ends up deep in debt. 

Ambushing an opponent: 

The investigator wants to gain concealment and attack with 
an  advantage.  If  the  investigator  makes  a  winning  Stealth 
skill  roll  (opposed  by  the  enemy’s  Spot  Hidden  skill)  you 
might grant a bonus die to the player’s first attack, or simply 
allow an automatic success.

Swimming to safety (drowning): 

An  investigator  has  fallen  into  turbulent  water  and  must 
swim to safety or drown. The Keeper calls for a swim roll 
with  the  goal “swim  to  safety.”  If  the  player  loses,  then  no 
progress is made and water may be inhaled; the player must 
make a CON roll or his or her investigator will suffer 1D6 
damage per round (see Other Forms of Damage, page 205). 
The situation demands a pushed roll—the only alternative 
is  that  the  investigator  gives  up  and  drowns.  If  the  player 
misses the pushed swim roll, the investigator is battered and 
half-drowned,  taking  1D6  damage  per  round.  The  Keeper 
must then make an important decision: either the investi-
gator’s life is put on the line or the investigator is washed up 
later elsewhere. If the Keeper chooses the former, then the 
investigator will continue to lose hit points each round until 
saved by another investigator or non-player character. Alter-
natively, if no one else is around, the Keeper could waive the 
drowning damage and instead have the unsuccessful pushed 
roll mean that the investigator has washed up on some for-
eign shore, bereft of all possessions and in a bad way.

Strangling an enemy:

First the attacker would use a Fighting Maneuver with the 
aim of “seizing my victim in a stranglehold”. The standard 
combat rules accommodate this. After completing the ma-
neuver, on each successive round the attacker (who is now 
acting with one bonus die as a result of the successful fight-
ing  maneuver)  may  strangle  the  target  using  the  Fighting 
skill to make attacks as normal; any damage is narrated as 
strangulation. Note how this uses standard combat rules.

House Rules
If  you  wish  to  create  a  custom  or  house  rule  for  specific 
circumstances, think carefully before doing so.

Are  you  sure  that  what  you  want  to  do  would  not  be 
handled equally well using the standard rules? Is a custom 
rule going to add significantly to the game? 

The  game  includes  specific  rules  for  combat,  chases, 
magic,  luck,  sanity,  and  physical  harm.  Everything  else  is 

handled with skill rolls. For example, no specific rules are in-
cluded for how long a person can survive without food and 
water or how long it takes to hack into a computer network. 
These things can be decided by the Keeper as appropriate to 
the current scenario, using the standard rules and personal 
judgment.  However,  if  one  of  these  is  a  key  element  in  a 
particular  scenario,  then  it  might  be  appropriate  to  come 
up with custom rules that specifically focus on that aspect. 
When making a custom rule, try to keep it simple—focus 
on one skill or a limited number of skills (or characteristics) 
and decide on a method of tracking degrees of success. Try 
to  build  in  meaningful  decisions  that  can  be  taken  by  the 
players; such things might alter the difficulty level or change 
which skill is used.

Of course, the rulebook could attempt to list a specific 
rule for every eventuality, but this leads to a game in which 
the rules must constantly be referred to and in which every-
one is restrained by a rule on every action. Call of Cthulhu is 
designed to be flexible and to encourage the Keeper to make 
creative use of the core rule: the skill roll.

You are writing a scenario that begins with the inves-
tigators lost in a desert, with limited food and water. 
The  aim  is  to  design  a  rule  that  will  emphasize  the 
effects of deprivation and fatigue. Being in the desert 
will  lead  to  dehydration,  disorientation,  starvation, 
sunburn,  and  fatigue. You  decide  that  the  key  char-
acteristic  relating  to  this  is  CON.  Ultimately,  being 
lost in the desert will lead to death, so hit points will 
be  used  to  track  failure.  The  players  will  be  asked 
to make a CON roll for each day of game time that 
passes—if a player fails the roll, their investigator will 
take 1D3 damage. Normally this would heal, but you 
decide that no healing is permitted due to the severe 
conditions.  An  investigator’s  hit  points  might  fall  to 
zero over the course of a few days, at which time he 
or  she  would  be  unconscious  and  facing  imminent 
death. The “new” rule fits with the intention and you 
institute this as a custom rule for use in that scenario.

Characteristic Rolls 
The standard rules present a method of generating charac-
teristics and creating an investigator. A variety of alternative 
approaches  are  presented  in  Chapter  3:  Creating  Investi-
gators.  Players  expect  consistency.  If  you  allow  one  player 
to  re-roll  or  juggle  characteristics,  you  should  be  up  front 
about it and apply the same approach for all players.

Action Scenes
Scenes  involving  multiple  investigators,  non-player  char-
acters  and/or  monsters  can  become  confusing,  especially 
when  trying  to  figure  out  who  is  doing  what  and  when. 

205 

chapter 10: playing the gameTo maintain control, you should quickly establish a list of 
investigators and non-player characters in DEX order. Start 
with  the  highest  DEX  (at  the  top  of  the  list)  and  resolve 
that character’s action, then work down the list in turn. The 
round is over when everyone has had their turn; go back to 
the top of the list and start over until the situation or scene 
is resolved. 

Some actions take longer to perform than others. Some-
times  the  rules  define  how  long  it  may  take  to  perform  a 
particular  action,  such  as  with  combat  attacks  and  spells, 
but for other actions you will have to make a judgment. 

Ricardo Moore attempts to pick a lock while his com-
panions protect his back from marauding cultists. The 
Keeper rules that it will take 3 combat rounds to pick 
the lock—more if the roll is pushed.

“But That’s How it Works in Reality”
When using your judgment over what might happen in the 
game, try to balance a sense of reality with what you think 
will  create  a  dramatic  situation—if  it’s  clear  that  being  a 
slave  to  verisimilitude  is  going  to  produce  a  dull  outcome 
then try being more creative. This is not to imply that you 
should strive to be unrealistic; however, if you find yourself 
justifying  a  universally  undesirable  event  with  the  phrase, 
“But that’s how it works in reality,” you should ask yourself 
if you couldn’t do something more dramatically creative. A 
shotgun  blast,  for  example,  may  not  send  a  person  flying 
back through the air in reality, but if you like the idea of it 
doing so then where’s the harm?

Movement
All  distances  are  approximate  and  based  on  narrative 
description,  so  accurate  measurement  will  rarely  be  an 
issue. Should you wish to gauge distances then, as a rough 
guide,  a  character  can  cautiously  travel  one  meter  or  yard 
per movement point (MOV) in one combat round; thus an 
average human can travel 8 meters in one combat round. If 
sprinting, a character might cover five times that distance, 
but would soon tire.

Hit Points and Physical Injury for 
Non-Player Characters
You  should  use  the  standard  damage  rules  for  non-player 
characters. However, non-player characters are under your 
control.  If  you  decide  that  a  non-player  character  has  a 
heart attack and drops dead on the spot then that is what 
happens,  so  it  follows  that  if  an  investigator  punches  a 
non-player  character,  and  you  decide  that  the  non-player 
character  drops  dead  as  a  result  of  the  attack,  then  that  is 
what  happens. You  don’t  even  have  to  ask  for  a  roll  to  hit 
or  a  damage  roll  on  a  non-player  character  if  you  do  not 
wish to. If an investigator has a non-player character at his 

or her mercy (perhaps a knife held to their throat) and states 
that he or she is killing the non-player character then allow 
this to happen without using dice if you wish. This would of 
course be exceptional; however, it illustrates the point that 
you are only compelled to apply the rules when they directly 
affect an investigator. You can have a ceiling fall and crush a 
non-player character without a roll, but an investigator will 
always get a dice roll—in this case, perhaps to dodge falling 
masonry or to notice the loose ceiling before it falls.

Players  may  assess  a  non-player  character’s  injuries  by 
tracking the damage they inflict or simply by what the inves-
tigators perceive, although these may not be wholly reliable, 
as a non-player character might have magical defense or may 
only  be  pretending  to  be  injured.  When  a  successful  First 
Aid or Medicine roll is performed on a non-player character, 
you  should  indicate  to  the  player  whether  the  non-player 
character is dying, dead, or alive. 

The investigators may reduce an enemy to unconscious-
ness—a  condition  from  which  the  enemy  will  most  likely 
recover, given time. This may provide a moral dilemma—do 
the investigators allow an evil cultist to live or do they carry 
out  a  summary  execution?  In  most  cases,  cold-blooded 
murder should incur a Sanity roll.

Chases
The task of describing a location is usually part of the Keep-
er’s role; in a chase, however, when the player wins a Luck 
roll, he or she is encouraged to do so. Some players may be 
hesitant  to  do  this,  in  which  case  you  should  ask  leading 
questions and encourage the player to elaborate.

Harvey  is  running  along  a  street,  pursued  by  an 
enraged  gang.  The  Keeper  has  no  plans  for  the  sur-
rounding area and decides to throw it open to chance. 
Harvey’s player wins a Luck roll and gets to define the 
next few locations. Harvey’s player looks a little blank. 
“OK, so you’re running up the street, it’s crowded 
with  evening  shoppers  and  people  heading  home 
from work. You’ve passed your Dodge roll and weave 
through the crowd with ease. There are alleys to the 
left and right, some shops are still open, where are you 
heading?” the Keeper asks.

“Um, I’ll head for a side alley.”
“Great. What’s the alley like? Is it clear or are there 
any obstacles such as trashcans? Is there anyone in the 
alley?” the Keeper prompts the player.

“There’s  a  garbage  truck  and  men  emptying 

trashcans into it,” the player states.

“So you’re going to have to dodge around them?”
The Keeper sums up what the player has said and 
defines  the  location  clearly,  writing  it  on  the  sheet. 
“So the next Location is an alley, partially blocked by 
a garbage truck and workers. The alley features one 
hazard requiring a Dodge roll.”

Call of CthulhuPresenting the  
Terrors of the Mythos
In  Chapter  14:  Monsters,  Beasts  and  Alien  Gods,  each 
monster  has  a  description  (usually  taken  directly  from 
a  Mythos  story).  These  are  a  great  place  to  start,  but  you 
should try to build upon these and vary your descriptions so 
that recurring monsters do not become mundane. 

Using  images  to  present  the  horrors  of  the  Cthulhu 
Mythos can be problematic. While the Internet and books 
can  sometimes  provide  approximations  of  some  of  the 
monsters  of  the  Mythos,  they  are  not  always  ideal,  and 
sometimes  detract  from  the  sense  of  horror  that  you  as 
Keeper are trying to portray. Likewise, popping a miniature 
figure of an elder thing onto the gaming table is more likely 
to have the effect of breaking any tension you have built thus 
far (such miniatures can be useful later on, once you have 
fully set the scene and engaged the players with a sense of 
dread or horror).

As many film directors know, the motto “less is more” is 
a  useful  one  to  remember  when  presenting  mind-blasting 
entities from beyond space and time. Try describing mon-
sters  vaguely,  hinting  at  their  otherworldliness  and  letting 
each player’s imagination fill in the blanks. 

Each time you present a monster, present it afresh. Make 
the description intense and visceral. A deep one is never just 
a deep one. It is always a creature from the depths of the sea 
and  old  as  time  itself,  a  creature  whose  very  presence  hits 
you deep in the gut, repelling mankind in a profound man-
ner causing revulsion and nausea. Remember, it is never just 
a deep one.

Take this description of a hound of Tindalos:

“Out of the room’s corner jumps a hound of Tin-

dalos. It’s going to attack you...”

Perhaps we can do a little better:
“You  see  a  strange-looking  dog  appear  from  the 
corner of the room. Its eyes are yellow and its skin a 
pale blue color. It snarls evilly at you, rises on its hind 
legs and leaps towards you...”

Or how about this:
“As  you  look  about  the  room,  a  foul  stench  fills 
your  nostrils. You  find  yourself  choking  on  the  fetid 
air. Your  eyes  turn  irresistibly  towards  the  northeast 
corner as a sickly yellow light appears to leech from the 
walls. The light grows in intensity, burning your eyes. 
It’s difficult to make out, but you begin to see a dark 
shape  emerge  from  the  corner,  out  of  the  repulsive 
yellow light. The hairs on the back of your neck stand 
up as you realize something bad is approaching. You 
hear a terrible, inhuman snarl and you see a pair of 
jaws open, revealing lines of razor-sharp teeth...”

By setting the tone and using appropriate descrip-

tion, the player’s imagination will do the rest.

Playing Alien Entities

Then, too, there was the upsetting of the larder, the disap-
pearance of certain staples, and the jarringly comical heap of 
tin cans pried open in the most unlikely ways and at the most 
unlikely places. The profusion of scattered matches, intact, 
broken, or spent, formed another minor enigma—as did the 
two or three tent cloths and fur suits which we found lying 
about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably 
due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations. 
—H.P. Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness

Only  the  Keeper  knows  how  the  creatures  of  the  Mythos 
should behave. Anything they do may be important. They 
are capable of influencing investigators in all sorts of ways. 
In too many games, monsters just turn up, growl or pipe in 
an eldritch tone and then attack. This presentation is limit-
ing, predictable, and unworthy of the Mythos.

Intelligent  creatures  build,  experiment,  worship,  learn, 
perform  magic,  question,  torture,  or  do  anything  else  hu-
mans might do. They do much more as well; things that are 
odd, inexplicable, or incomprehensible. 

The horror, mystery and tone of the game are best served 
if behaviors are dark and unusual. The actions of such crea-
tures are beyond the imagination and you should strive to 
portray them as sinister, threatening, and unwholesome. 

The easy identification of a monster takes away mystery 
and reveals details about the plot. Don’t let investigators get 
information for free. If they get closer to the thing, it is still 
not  a  deep  one—it  is  a  dark,  wet  shape,  half-submerged, 
draped with seaweed, stinking like long-dead fish.

When monsters die, it is up to you whether they exhibit 
symptoms  of  distress,  simply  collapse,  or  vanish.  Mythos 
creatures  that  die  often  dissolve  or  evaporate—the  nox-
ious cloud soon replaced by a damp spot and clean air, as 
happened  to  Wilbur  Whateley  in  Miskatonic  University’s 
library in The Dunwich Horror. This conveniently leaves the 
investigators short of physical evidence. 

Descriptions  need  not  be  entirely  visual  and  become 
more real if two or more senses can be employed, such as 
sight  and  smell.  Did  the  monster  leave  a  trail  of  noxious 
slime behind? Describe its texture. Does it expel disagreeable 
odors? Does it emit a strange, high-pitched wail as the slime 
dissolves? Don’t strain for effect or break off the narrative 
to  try  to  come  up  with  the  right  word,  but  keep  in  mind 
texture, smell, taste, and quality of light as possible factors. 
Smell is particularly evocative, perhaps because it cannot 
be  communicated  by  second-hand  stimuli  such  as  photo-
graphs,  radio,  or  television;  we  know  a  thing  is  physically 
present with us when we can smell it. Sometimes the mere 
proximity of a Mythos monster can make the hairs on the 
investigator’s neck stand up. 

The  evidence  that  a  creature  leaves  behind—pools, 
prints,  fragments,  flakes,  etc.—or  the  damage  it  has  done, 
provide a much more interesting way to lead to the deduc-
tion of its identity or purpose. Sets of clues that add up to a 
baffling monster can make for fascinating play.

207 

chapter 10: playing the gameSometimes, a monster looks the same whether or not it is alive. Use caution when confirming kills.

Remember that nearly all Mythos races, such as mi-go, ser-
pent men, and deep ones, are of human intelligence or higher, 
lead  longer  lives  and  are  more  knowledgeable  of  the  world 
and cosmos around them. Who among these semi-immortals 
would willingly risk death for some momentary victory over 
beings who are to them the equivalent of chimpanzees? Lack-
ing reasons to fight, intelligent creatures retreat before danger. 
Avoid negotiation between investigators and their inhuman 
adversaries—such actions suggest that the monsters operate 
on a human level and diminishes their horror.

Shoggoths and other entities of lesser intelligence should 
be terrifyingly unpredictable and rancorous. Such creatures 
may  well  launch  all-out  attacks  and  can  be  terrible  in 
their  wrath. Here the challenge is physical and the  Keeper 
is  obliged  only  to  give  reasonable  warning  of  impending 
doom.  Attacking  the  shoggoth  who  lives  in  the  cave  can 
be an episodic problem, one that can be returned to until 
the  investigators  can  destroy  it—should  they  survive  long 
enough—seal it in, or somehow banish it elsewhere.

Looking Away Won’t Save You!

And as I watched the ripples that told of the writhing of 
worms beneath, I felt a new chill from afar out whither the 
condor had flown, as if my flesh had caught a horror before 
my eyes had seen it.
—H.P. Lovecraft, What the Moon Brings.

This quote illustrates how we perceive with all of our senses, 
not just our eyes. Given the alien nature of the Mythos, we 
might even perceive its presence through some primal sense 
beyond  the  known  five  that  we  recognize.  Averting  one’s 
eyes  from  the  TV  screen  may  shield  us  from  the  sight  of 
unwanted scenes of horror, but this is rarely enough when 
confronted  with  the  tangible,  unspeakable  presence  of  a 
Mythos monster. 

Winners and Losers
Call of Cthulhu is not a competition between you and the 
players.  The  rules  ensure  that  everyone  is  treated  fairly; 
however,  there  is  no  mechanism  to  enforce  game  balance 
between the Keeper and the players. Balance is derived from 
the decisions that you make as Keeper. You decide what the 

208 

Call of Cthulhuinvestigators encounter, you set the scene, you decide on the 
actions of the non-player characters. 

The odds can easily be stacked against the players. There 
are no rules to limit what you can present the investigators 
with; if you decide that a host of dark young descend on the 
investigators  while  they  are  asleep,  then  there  is  little  that 
the players can do to save their investigators. This would not 
make for a good game nor happy players. You must measure 
the threat and be aware that many of the monsters presented 
in this book are capable of wiping out a party of investiga-
tors. Usually, the best option open to the investigators is to 
flee and live to fight another day.

Fair Warning
Keepers should endeavor to provide players with the chance 
to avoid investigator death wherever possible. This is not to 
say that Keepers should diminish the abilities of monsters 
and villains in the game, or pull their punches when dealing 
out  damage  from  attacks  and  other  injuries.  Rather,  it  is 
recommended that Keepers give players up to three chances 
to avoid certain death.

Failed Sanity Rolls
A  sense  of  self-control  is  an  essential  quality  of  sanity.  A 
non-player  character  may  hold  a  gun  to  an  investigator’s 
head and demand information regarding a missing segment 
of the R’lyeh Disk, but whether the investigator tells or ac-
cepts a bullet in the head is up to the player. However, when a 
Sanity roll is failed, the investigator loses all self-control and 
may act in a way that is counter to his or her best interests. 
People who lose control may harm themselves or others, 
even loved ones, or act in some other way that is counter to 
how they would act when rational. To simulate this loss of 
self-control,  the  investigator  is  handed  to  you,  the  Keeper, 
for a short time—whenever a Sanity roll is failed you take 
control and dictate the investigator’s next action. As always, 
you  should  aim  to  drive  the  game  towards  the  theme  of 
horror  and  consider  how  an  involuntary  action  could  do 
this. For example, if the investigators are hiding under a bed 
when the cannibal cult arrive home, will one of them cry out 
upon missing a Sanity roll as a result of seeing the cultists 
preparing their lunch?

If the Sanity roll results in insanity, the Keeper gains con-
trol of the investigator’s actions for the duration of the bout 
of  madness.  This  won’t  be  for  long—in  real  time  at  least. 
Once the bout of madness is over, control of the investigator 
is  handed  back  to  the  player.  Note  the  difference  between 
madness, which is of short duration, and the underlying in-
sanity, which is longer—the Keeper controls the investigator 
during madness, the player controls during insanity.

Players may take a cue from their investigator going insane 
to present their character as "mad" all of the time—while they 
can portray their character however they wish, you may want 
to remind such players that being insane does not necessarily 
mean that the character acts out their madness all of the time. 
Indeed, while there is an underlying insanity, the investigator 

209 

The investigators have closed in on the hideout of the Cult 
of the Whispering Tongue and are currently searching the 
secret base for leads on the cult’s plans to unleash devasta-
tion on New York City. What the investigators don’t know 
is that the cult has a shoggoth living in an underground 
pool. The shoggoth is powerful and very likely to kill some, 
if not all, of the investigators if they blunder into it—such 
an outcome will most likely mean the premature end of the 
game. Therefore, the Keeper provides the players with three 
chances to avoid confronting the shoggoth.

The first chance comes when the Keeper discusses the 
players’  plans  for  searching  the  hideout. The  players  are 
excited and it appears they want to rush in, abandoning 
any sense of caution. During the conversation, the Keeper 
rephrases what the players are saying as, “So you think the 
murderous Cult of the Whispering Tongue are hiding out 
here and you want to rush in with guns blazing, with no 
evidence  that  this  in  indeed  the  right  place?”  Hopefully, 
something along these lines will give the players enough of 
a hint that a degree of caution might be advisable. Perhaps 
they should stake out the place first to gather more infor-
mation about the cult’s activities.

Having watched the hideout for a couple of days, the 
players have recognized some of the cultists and are now 
certain  that  they  have  the  right  place.  The  investigators 
quietly gain entry and are searching the many rooms of the 
building when they come upon a lone cultist. After a quick 
fight, the cultist is captured, and the investigators decide 
to question him before going any further. The Keeper uses 
this opportunity to give a second hint that the players really 
should avoid entering the cave under the cellar. When the 
players ask the captured cultist what is in the cellar, the 
Keeper replies in the voice of the cultist “Go in the cellar, 
eh? That’s a good idea. Yes, you go down there and find 
the pool! You’ll get just what’s coming to you down there! 
Ha Ha HA!!” The Keeper presents the cultists as mad and 
dangerous, hoping that the players will pick up on the fact 
that whatever is in the pool in the cellar is dangerous.

Ignoring the Keeper’s hints so far, the players tie up the 
cultist and leave him hidden in a closet, and decide to go 
straight to the cellar to check out the pool (no one said that 
the players will listen to the Keeper!). As they explore the 
cellar, one of them discovers stone steps leading down to a 
large hole in the floor. As the investigators look down the 
steps, the Keeper provides a third and final warning, “The 
stone steps look slimy and there’s a foul smell—something 
evil dwells down there. You can hear the water splash, like 
something  huge  was  climbing  out  of  a  pool.  A  hideous 
popping sound carries up the stairs. Whatever’s down there 
doesn’t smell or sound good.”

Whatever the players decide to do next is up to them, 
but the Keeper has now given them three warnings that 
this isn’t going to be a walk in the park. Hopefully the play-
ers are at least prepared and forearmed now—if they have 
any sense they’ll run rather than try to fight the shoggoth!

chapter 10: playing the game210 

Call of Cthulhumay act and function completely normally in everyday situ-
ations, however if they suffer further Sanity point loss, then 
a bout of madness ensues and the character’s madness takes 
hold for the duration of the bout.

Ultimately with the onset of permanent insanity (which 
equates with permanent madness) the player’s control of his 
or her investigator comes to an end.

One  way  to  think  of  Call  of  Cthulhu  is  as  a  struggle 
between  player  and  Keeper  for  control  of  the  investigator. 
The player takes the side of rational and sane behavior, while 
you,  the  Keeper,  are  like  a  little  devil  on  the  investigator’s 
shoulder, constantly pushing the investigator into situations 
that will lead to your gaining control, resulting in madness 
and irrational behavior.

Delusions
Delusions have greater impact if the delusion has some rel-
evance to the investigator. A great way to do this is to keep 
track  of  each  investigator’s  backstory  and  use  the  entries 
as  inspiration  for  delusions.  A  lone  investigator  might  set 
out to explore some old house, only to meet an old friend 
there (from his or her backstory). The whole event may be a 
delusion taking place in the investigator’s home. 

A number of films offer good inspiration for how to use 
delusions  and  madness,  among  them  Twelve  Monkeys,  Bug, 
The  Shining,  The  Lovely  Bones,  Pan’s  Labyrinth,  Fight  Club 
and Mulholland Drive. In these movies, characters struggle to 
differentiate between reality and hallucinations, and we, the 
viewer, are unsure if what we are seeing is real or imaginary.

Scaring the Players
“What would your feelings be, seriously, if your cat or your 
dog began to talk to you, and to dispute with you in human 
accents? You would be overwhelmed with horror. I am sure 
of it. And if the roses in your garden sang a weird song, you 
would go mad. And suppose the stones in the road began to 
swell and grow before your eyes, and if the pebble that you 
noticed at night had shot out stony blossoms in the morning?”
—Arthur Machen, The White People

The horror genre can be a lot of fun. Right down to pound-
ing hearts and sweating brows, it is part of human nature to 
find pleasure in being scared, as long as being scared is not 
for real. Of course, actually scaring anyone is rare in a game 
consisting of dice and paper, but be assured it can happen. 

The  game’s  setting  is  ostensibly  that  of  the  real  world 
with which we are intimately familiar. As you play, strive to 
make the world realistic so your players feel at home in it. If 
a monster appeared in real life, most of us would be scared, 
but a player is unlikely to be scared even if a monster enters 
through  his  or  her  investigator’s  front  door—the  player 
knows this is a horror game, and is expecting monsters. In-
stead of using a monster to scare a player, try to confound the 
player’s expectations of how things in the “real” world work. 
Consider the following event for example: the investigator 

says  goodbye  to  his  wife  as  she  leaves  the  house  for  work, 
and then, five minutes later, his wife walks down the stairs in 
her dressing gown. Don’t provide an explanation. If you can 
induce cognitive dissonance (holding two conflicting ideas 
simultaneously) in the player, you will open the door to fear 
as the player’s mind struggles to make sense of the situation. 
We get scared when we can’t make sense of things, especially 
when those things that don’t make sense are the mundane, 
everyday things that we know we should understand. 

Pacing  works  hand-in-hand  with  confounding  expec-
tations  to  create  a  sense  of  escalating  tension  and  terror. 
Present  the  players  with  problems  and,  when  the  player 
shows signs of coping with the problems, toss in an addi-
tional complication. Look through your scenario, consider 
the problems that will arise for the investigators and be on 
the lookout for more as you play. 

Harvey  has  discovers  that  a  cult  is  operating  in  the 
local  town  (problem  1).  Investigations  lead  him  to 
discover  that  they  are  planning  something  horrible 
for  the  town  fair  tomorrow  night  (problem  2)!  As 
his investigations proceed, he unearths evidence that 
Uncle Theodore is involved with the cult—is the in-
formation really true (problem 3)?

Harvey  is  desperate  and  seeks  the  help  of  an  old 
friend, Matthias Nixon, who is learned in magic. Un-
beknownst to Harvey, Nixon is in a state of transition, 
becoming a ghoul. Nixon offers Harvey a bargain: he 
will  help  Harvey,  but  in  return  Harvey  must  supply 
him with a fresh human corpse (problem 4). 

Harvey’s problems are piling up and the clock is 

ticking.

Magic
Magic  is  part  of  the  Cthulhu  Mythos  and  man  can  never 
fully comprehend it. Each spell has its own description listed 
in Chapter 12: Grimoire; however, spells are in the Keeper’s 
domain and therefore mutable. You are free to change any 
aspect  of  a  spell  as  you  wish.  Consistency  is  antithetical 
to  the  horror  genre—Lovecraft  himself  never  constrained 
himself with it, so neither should you. Once a spell or mon-
ster is established in a given story, you will probably want 
to keep it largely unchanged for the duration of that story, 
but this does not mean that in another story with different 
investigators the same monster or spell cannot manifest in a 
quite different way. 

The spell Wave of Oblivion (page 265) requires a body 
of  salt  water  to  be  present  for  the  spell  to  work  and 
describes  its  effect  as  a  mighty  ocean  wave  crashing 
down  upon  the  target.  There’s  no  reason  why  this 
couldn’t instead be a wave of invisible force or a wind 
so strong it tears flesh from the bone.

211 

chapter 10: playing the gameAs well as the danger associated with the first casting of a 
spell, you are encouraged to incorporate your own ideas for 
hazards for the spells, perhaps to suit your scenario. 

Tomes
You should note that the rules state that it is up to you when 
to call for rolls, and this applies equally to reading tomes and 
using magic. If reading the tome is essential to the progres-
sion of your plot, then beware of introducing a dice roll and 
thus a risk of failure.

Using the Optional Rule: Spontaneous 
Use of the Cthulhu Mythos Skill
Clearly, use of this option must be handled with care, as it 
can potentially place disproportionate power in the hands of 
a player. When an investigator has only 2% Cthulhu Mythos 
skill,  the  chances  of  successfully  using  spontaneous  magic 
are very low. You may be tempted by this low probability of 
success to allow an investigator a chance to achieve a major 
goal, such as raising the dead through spontaneous use of 
the Cthulhu Mythos skill. This may become an issue when 
that same investigator has 50% Cthulhu Mythos skill in the 
future; suddenly what was a rare chance becomes a fifty-fifty 
chance and the investigator is casually raising the dead on a 
daily basis. Only you can decide what is appropriate to your 
game, so take care not to allow overly generous goals simply 
because  the  present  chance  of  success  is  very  low.  Opting 
to  downscale  an  investigator’s  abilities  later  will  give  the 
players a sense of being penalized and should be avoided by 
using some forethought.

When setting goals for the use of Cthulhu Mythos skill, 
refer  to  a  comparable  spell  for  guidance  on  costs  and  re-
quirements. Tell the player how many magic points it will 
cost  when  the  goal  is  agreed,  or  perhaps  state  a  die  type 
(e.g. 1D8) that will be rolled to determine the magic point 
cost.  Each  spontaneous  use  of  Cthulhu  Mythos  should  be 
dangerous and unique; losing the pushed roll can have dire 
consequences (see The Consequences of Failing a Pushed 
Casting Roll, page 178).

You  may  decide  to  be  more  generous  in  the  setting  of 
goals for the use of the spontaneous Cthulhu Mythos skill 
if the goal is associated with the investigator’s profession. In 
this way a doctor could become a Herbert West-style char-
acter—a mad doctor bent on the reanimation of dead tissue.

Entering the World of the Cthulhu Mythos
In  creating  atmosphere,  the  Keeper  should  play  up  the 
transition that the investigators go through when they come 
to  realize  the  reality  of  the  Mythos.  For  someone  with  no 
Cthulhu Mythos skill points or who disbelieves in it (see Be-
coming a Believer, page 179), the world is a place of hope, a 
place where mankind has the potential to live in happiness, 
a place where the investigator can look forward to settling 
down, starting a family and enjoying a long and happy life. 
However, for those who take the irrevocable step and com-

prehend the true nature of the universe, that optimistic light 
is extinguished forever. 

When  one  becomes  a  believer,  the  world  changes  and 
becomes a threatening and unpleasant place—people look 
strange  and  threatening,  and  the  wind  blows  cold.  There 
are no more tranquil places, only places of dread. The once 
great  achievements  of  mankind  are  now  seen  as  shallow 
mockeries.  Where  once  cheery  faces  gathered  to  welcome 
the  investigator,  now  there  are  only  lurking  figures  whose 
eyes  are  filled  with  malice  and  resentment.  Those  with 
knowledge  of  the  Mythos  face  a  worse  fate  than  most.  As 
their sanity is drained away, the nightmares increase, until 
they perceive the horror even with their waking mind. When 
all sanity is gone, as their mind snaps, they hear it clearly, but 
for a moment:  the dreadful Call of Cthulhu.

Ending a Story
Everyone likes a good ending, but what constitutes a good 
ending? Consider films: some end with a bang (Star Wars), 
others  end  at  a  crucial  point  (The  Italian  Job)  and  some 
simply stop mid-flow (No Country for Old Men).

Potentially,  a  game  could  continue  on  and  on,  but  as 
Keeper you should know when the story comes to an end. 
Sometimes the ending is obvious, other times it is a matter 
of deciding when to say, “cut”. If the investigators defeat the 
big bad in a battle, this clearly presents one way to end the 
game. Other times an ending may not be so clear. 

If  you’ve  been  playing  for  several  hours  and  want  to 
draw  the  session  to  a  close,  you  have  a  couple  of  options. 
Ask the players if they want to continue the story another 
day. If so, try to bring the game to a cliffhanger or dramatic 
moment and then cease play. If people want to end the game 
then fast-forward to the final scene. An Idea roll (page 199) 
may be useful here to decide whether the investigators begin 
the final scene in an advantageous position or not. Tell the 
players  what  they  find  out  and  where  it  takes  them,  and 
then kick off the final scene in medias res. The movie Planet 
Terror (a.k.a. Grindhouse) illustrates this approach wonder-
fully: simulating the outdated problem of having a missing 
reel of film, the movie jumps to a later scene of carnage with 
the protagonists in the thick of the action.

Investigator Death
In some instances, death (even death of the whole investi-
gator  group)  can  be  a  dramatic  and  memorable  outcome. 
But the death of an investigator knocks a player out of the 
game until such a time that a new investigator can be created 
and introduced to the story. Don’t be too ready to deal out 
death if other interesting options are possible. Endeavoring 
to make the game an enjoyable experience for everyone is 
far more important than being a slave to realism. 

Remember, this is a horror game, and the threat of both 
death and insanity should accompany the investigators’ ev-
ery step. An investigator is controlled by a player and there 
are only two outcomes that permanently end this: death and 
permanent insanity. 

212 

Call of CthulhuYou  may  be  tempted  towards  leniency  when  it  comes 
to  dealing  out  damage,  but  be  mindful  that  in  most  cases 
accumulated damage leads to unconsciousness rather than 
death.  Players  are  encouraged  to  form  an  attachment  to 
their investigators and the death of an investigator should 
always be a significant event. Don’t be surprised if a player 
welcomes the death of an investigator, especially if the death 
is heroic, meaningful, or will simply make a great anecdote!

Epilogues
A short epilogue for each investigator is a nice way to wrap 
up  the  end  of  a  story. A  brief  epilogue  can  be  used  to  tell 
what becomes of each investigator in the aftermath of the 
story, and provides an opportunity to recognize every play-
er’s contribution to the game. Go around the group and talk 
to  each  player  in  turn  about  the  fate  of  their  investigator. 
There’s  no  need  for  dice  rolls,  just  a  brief  description  of 
what  the  future  holds.  Try  to  make  each  epilogue  suitably 
Lovecraftian and appropriate to your story.

Things don’t go well for a group of three investigators 
playing Amidst the Ancient Trees. Two investigators  
are  dead  and  the  remaining  survivor  has  fled  into 
the forest after a sanity breaking encounter with the 
monster in the lake. The Keeper could just end it there, 
but it feels a little abrupt. Instead the Keeper suggests 
a brief epilogue and looks to the player of the surviv-
ing investigator. “What becomes of you?” The player 
suggests that the investigator returns to town ranting 
about  the  "Thing  in  the  lake."  The  Keeper  wraps 
things up:“Very well, the townsfolk don't believe your 
tales of watery monsters. Despite a search of the lake, 
no  evidence  is  found  to  substantiate  your  story. You 
find  that  it's  easier  to  hit  the  bottle  and  forget  your 
horrific  experienence,  but  each  night  bad  dreams 
haunt  you.  Eventually,  consumed  with  a  desire  to 
break-free of this curse, you head towards the lake, a 
box of dynamite in your hands...

Start with a mysterious event

Rather  than  starting  with  a  general  setting,  pick  a  more 
mysterious or unexplained event and build a scenario based 
upon it; for example the Tunguska event of 1908 in Russia.

Devise an alternate history

Pick  a  turning  point  in  history  and  ask  what  would  have 
happened if things had gone differently; what if Hitler had 
used Mythos magic to win the war?

Pick a monster or god

Use  a  Mythos  entity  as  inspiration  for  a  scenario;  picking 
“fire vampire” gives a theme of fire, for example. They may 
be summoned to attack people and are linked with the god 
Cthugha. Who might worship such a god, who might want 
to summon fire vampires and why?

Create a cult

In Lovecraft’s stories, many beings of the Mythos are too pow-
erful to be defeated by human opponents and so horrific that 
direct  knowledge  of  them  causes  insanity. When  dealing  with 
such beings, Lovecraft needed a way to provide exposition and 
build tension without bringing the story to a premature end. Hu-
man followers gave him a way to reveal information about their 
"gods" in a diluted form and made it possible for his protagonists 
to win paltry victories. If the investigators are going up against 
powerful Mythos entities every week, it won’t be long before they 
are all dead. Using human cultists, worshippers, mad scientists, 
and  other  suitably  nefarious  characters  will  provide  not  only 
more evenly matched opponents but also variety in your games.

Survival horror

The  most  basic  of  human  motivations  is  survival.  What 
clearer theme can there be than fighting for one’s life? Sur-
vival horror is popular horror sub-genre and can work well 
for scenarios in which the investigators are thrown head-first 
into a threatening situation and are forced to act to survive.

Isolation

Creating Scenarios
This section looks at the basic ingredients of a Call of Cthul-
hu  adventure,  aiming  to  help  you  take  your  first  steps  in 
crafting scenarios for a group of intrepid investigators.

There is no one single approach to creating a scenario 
any more than there is one way to write a book or compose 
a song. Here is a selection of starting points.

Start with setting details and build a story 
from the ground up

Picking  the  1969  Woodstock  Festival  as  the  setting,  the 
Keeper sets about researching the period, people involved, 
etc., and uses it as inspiration for a plot. 

Remember, the onus must be on the investigators. It is they 
who should feel compelled to deal with the situation rather 
than calling on external help, such as the police. Sometimes 
the  isolation  of  remote  places  can  be  complete,  where  the 
investigators are miles away from society and lack the ability 
to  call  for  help.  In  other  situations  they  may  be  isolated  of 
their own volition; perhaps the investigators are wanted for a 
crime and are forced to isolate themselves to avoid arrest and 
imprisonment. In such situations the investigators must work 
on the fringes of society, outside of the protection of the law.

Pick a story

Seek  inspiration  from  a  Lovecraft  story  or  perhaps  some-
thing else, such as a film or television show. Make alterations 

213 

chapter 10: playing the gameto  it,  perhaps  stripping  it  down  to  its  essential  parts  then 
building  it  up  in  a  new  and  interesting  way.  For  example, 
take The Shadow over Innsmouth and place it in a lush forest-
ed area, replacing deep ones with monster-human hybrids 
who worship Shub-Niggurath.

Begin with a compelling opening scene

The  investigators  begin  aboard  a  bus.  Looking  out  of  the 
window they see a man, apparently a vagrant, screaming at 
the pigeons. All of a sudden a rip appears in the fabric of 
space and things begin to spew forth. Perhaps this man is a 
wizard, opening a gate to the Dreamlands.

Big ending

Beware  of  using  a  climactic  scene  as  a  starting  point  from 
which to create a scenario. It can be done, but it involves a lot 
of work to figure out how to achieve the climax—and what if 
your players do something that will avert the climactic event?

A twist or hideous revelation

Come up with something exciting, mysterious or horrible, then 
create a scenario as a vehicle to deliver it. M. Night Shyamalan 
has used this technique to good effect in his films. For example, 
unbeknownst to them, one of the investigators is the evildoer, 
possessed or controlled by some malign force. The truth will 
most likely only be revealed towards the end of the game.

Begin with the player characters

Have the players generate their investigators and then use these 
characters and their backstories as the inspiration for a scenar-
io. This has the potential to be a strongly player-led game.

Construct Layers of Mystery
At the heart of a Call of Cthulhu scenario is a mystery, some-
thing  the  investigators  must  find  out  in  order  to  progress 
and affect an outcome. Mysteries can be organized like the 
layers of an onion: each clue tears away one layer and leads 
to  a  further  question  or  puzzle  to  solve  (another  layer). 
These layers might go on and on until the investigators feel 
they  have  a  possible  explanation  or  answer,  which  in  turn 
directs them to some form of action.

In Lovecraft’s The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, for example, 
young Ward begins by investigating the ancient writings of his 
wizard ancestor (there’s our story; our onion). As he investigates 
further (peeling away the first layer of the onion), he discovers 
a technique to raise the dead. He tries it (peeling away a second 
layer of the onion), and is able to raise his ancestor, who proves 
to be a near twin of Ward in appearance. This ancestor then 
becomes Ward’s mentor in the arcane arts (the third layer of 
the onion). However, young Ward proves too squeamish and 
his ancestor murders him and takes his place. That’s the end 
of the scenario for Ward, and the end of the first onion for us.

Young  Ward’s  doctor  then  starts  his  investigations, 
researching  along  the  same  lines  Ward  began.  This  is  the 

initial layer of a new onion. Dr. Willett finds that the ancient 
house  of  the  sinister  ancestor  still  stands  and  visits  it  (the 
second layer of this onion). In the house’s vast basements, 
Willett encounters horrific sights and beings, and discovers 
how  to  lay  to  rest  the  evil  ancestor  whom  he  suspects  has 
displaced his patient, young Ward (this is the third layer of 
the new onion). Now full of knowledge and determination, 
Willett  visits  the  insane  asylum  where  the  evil  ancestor 
masquerades as the young Ward. There, Willett recites the 
Resurrection  spell  backward,  destroying  the  ancestor  and 
finishing the second onion and the story as well.

Each layer of a scenario should present the investigators 
with  two  or  three  choices  as  to  where  to  proceed.  Players 
should never be certain that they have delved to the bottom 
of a mystery, except for their own purposes, nor should they 
ever  be  certain  of  the  Keeper’s  intentions.  Obviously,  the 
Keeper cannot make scenarios infinitely deep and complex, 
so must either break off play when the investigators get too 
deep,  or  improvise.  If  breaking  off  from  play,  this  should 
only  be  until  the  Keeper  manages  to  extend  the  scenario 
further and give more depth to the mysteries.

Using Lovecraftian Themes
The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the 
oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.

—H.P.Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature

Key themes can be recognized throughout Lovecraft’s writ-
ing, either lurking underneath the text or central to the plot. 
Utilizing these themes when designing scenarios and run-
ning games of Call of Cthulhu can help imbue your games 
with an undercurrent of Lovecraftian horror.

Fear…of the Alien, the Outsider, of 
Knowledge
A central tenet presented in nearly all of Lovecraft’s fiction 
is fear of the unknown. Anything that comes from outside 
of  your  normal  reality,  your  day-to-day  existence,  is  to  be 
feared. Such things have a way of invading your space, your 
life,  and  ultimately  destroying  your  very  personality  and 
way of life. Man is imprisoned and isolated. Truth lies in the 
dark,  secret  places  of  the  world;  in  ancient  woods,  hollow 
hills,  and  remote  locales.  Every  stranger  could  be  hiding 
something, plotting your demise, or wanting something of 
yours. Investigators find themselves cut off from civilization 
(no phones, ho help, no safety) with no one who will come 
to their aid. They are the “outsiders”.

Knowledge  causes  pain,  sorrow,  and  death.  Books  of 
secrets  and  magic  are  to  be  feared;  they  change  how  you 
perceive the world around you, they question your faith, and 
obliterate your very soul. Better they are destroyed or kept 
hidden lest some fool messes with things best left sleeping.

The  realization  that  something  has  affected  you,  be  it 
alien  implants,  false  memories,  or  dark  truths,  can  make 
for  highly  immersive  and  scary  stories.  The  investigators

Call of Cthulhu215 

chapter 10: playing the gameand  their  players  may  not  know  these  secrets  as  the  game 
starts—part of the horror (and fun) comes from unraveling 
the mystery and facing up to the big revelation.

Call of Cthulhu. 

Corruption…of the Body, the Mind, the 
World
A pervading sense of corruption, in mind and body. Many of 
Lovecraft’s stories carry a sense of decay in their surroundings 
and settings, as well as in the mental and physical decay of 
the protagonists. The slow, but inevitable creep of corruption 
can be a useful backdrop to a scenario to inspire a theme of 
foreboding and dread. Keepers can also take this theme and 
make it personal; for example, the slow developing and fright-
ening metamorphosis of an investigator into a deep one (the 
Innsmouth taint) or into a ghoul. Alterations in appearance 
and habits over time may provoke Sanity point loss for the 
investigator  as  well  as  those  around  him  or  her.  The  inves-
tigators in question may not be aware of what is happening, 
perhaps thinking the changes are caused by the slow creep of 
a dreadful disease or the results of insanity and delusion.

Family  bloodlines  carry  “memories”  and  taints.  De-
scendants cannot escape the stain of evil crimes committed 
by  their  forebears;  unwittingly,  they  begin  to  mirror  such 
dark deeds. Exposure to the Mythos drains not only sanity 
but also humanity. Those who repeatedly risk contact with 
things not of this world may become corrupted, losing their 
faith and mind. What lengths would such a person go to? 

The world around us is decaying. Walk any street, look 
at the signs in the window, look into the eyes of strangers on 
the street corners. The end is near. What hope is left? Every-
thing good crumbles away and is replaced with a mocking, 
choking darkness.

Cosmic Horror…the Nightmare of 
Reality, the Place of Humanity, the 
Cold Universe
At the start of the twentieth century, humanity’s increased 
reliance  upon  science  was  both  opening  new  worlds  and 
solidifying the manners by which they could be understood. 
Lovecraft  portrays  this  scientific  potential  as  a  terrifying 
hole in man's understanding of the universe. 

The cosmos is uncaring and humanity is but a speck of 
dust,  inconsequential.  Mankind  is  simply,  at  best,  sport  for 
those from outside to prey upon. The universe is a dark place 
that mocks humanity’s feeble attempts to understand it. 

The  quest  for  the  unknown  is  the  pursuit  of  madness. 
Strange  experiments  gone  wrong  (or  right!)  and  the  con-
struction of devices that lift the veil of mankind’s ignorance 
lead such explorers into darkest and most terrifying realms 
of reality and possibility. Man was not meant to know such 

things and those who seek for the unknown return “changed.” 
The very biology and composition of Mythos creatures is be-
yond man’s ability to know and understand. It is dangerous to 
become exposed to such matter; even being in the presence of 
such creatures and their technology is anathema to humans, 
causing headaches, pain, and a pervading dread.

Beyond, At the Mountains of Madness.

Of course, Lovecraft didn’t confine himself to Cthulhu 
Mythos  stories  and  neither  should  you.  Gain  inspiration 
from  other  writers,  television,  films  and  folklore.  Let  your 
imagination roam.

Opening Scene
Every journey starts with a first step. The start of a scenario 
establishes  the  premise  by  which  the  investigators  become 
involved and effectively provides the players with their ini-
tial direction of investigation and research. 

Don’t miss the opportunity to hook the players’ interest 
from the first with an exciting or intriguing opening scene. 
Ensure  that  it  is  thoroughly  engaging  and  something  the 
investigators can’t ignore.

Your  scenario  begins  with  the  players  learning  about 
a  murder  through  newspaper  reports.  Could  this  be 
made more engaging? What if one of the investigators 
discovered the mangled corpse while walking his dog. 
Consider what the investigator’s reaction might be? Is 
the scene challenging enough? Could it be ignored by 
the player? The example is unpleasant, but might not 
lead  anywhere  beyond  the  investigator  inspecting  the 
scene for clues and calling the police. What if the victim 
is known to the investigator and able to talk for a brief 
time before dying? What if the victim is someone the 
investigator would be glad to see the back of? Perhaps 
someone  to  whom  the  investigator  is  in  debt?  Take  a 
look at the investigators’ backstories for inspiration.

Anatomy of a Linear Scenario
While  scenarios  can  come  in  all  shapes  and  forms,  the 
majority share some common elements, much like a classic 
piece of detective fiction. A beginning, middle, and an end is 
a good place to start. Without these three a scenario will lack 
definition and has the potential to become a confusing mess, 
not only for the players, but also for the Keeper. 

The  beginning  sets  up  the  whole  game:  it  hooks  the 
players’  interest,  sets  the  tone  and  mood,  and  provides 
an  initial  source  of  clues  and  leads  for  investigation.  The 
middle is where the investigators get to pursue information, 
meet  non-player  characters,  discover  clues,  and  begin  to 
piece together the bigger picture. The end comes when the 
investigators  have  (more  or  less)  discovered  what’s  going 

216 

Call of CthulhuConstructing  a  plot  is  essential  to  good  linear  scenario 
design,  and  this  is  easy  to  do.  Just  think  about  the  books 
you’ve read, films and TV you’ve watched, and stories you’ve 
been told. All of these can provide great inspiration. Don’t be 
afraid to steal a cool idea or recreate a whole story as the basis 
of your scenario’s plot—every Keeper worth his or her (es-
sential) salt steals from movies and books. If you don’t know 
where to start, grab a collection of Lovecraft stories and get 
reading! Changing a few names and mixing up the monsters 
in a particular Lovecraft story is the perfect way to start.

Most  players,  as  they  become  more  familiar  with  the 
game  and  confident  in  their  investigators,  will  want  to 
diverge  from  the  linear  scenario.  Rather  than  follow  the 
obvious  clues  laid  out  for  them  by  the  Keeper,  they  will 
want to follow up a different clue or even come up with a 
line of enquiry entirely of their own devising. Suddenly the 
adventure  is  sidetracked  and  the  Keeper  may  be  tempted 
to contrive something to get the story back on its intended 
track  rather  than  go  where  the  players  are  heading.  If  the 
players  are  compelled  back  to  the  Keeper’s  prepared  plot, 
they will come to feel that their contribution is of little value 
and that they are simply following a preordained story rath-
er than creating their own. This means that it’s time to look 
at running scenarios in a non-linear way.

The Anatomy of a Non-Linear Scenario
Novice  Keepers  are  advised  to  create  linear  stories  at  first, 
moving  onto  non-linear  scenarios  as  their  experience  and 
confidence grows. 

In  a  non-linear  adventure,  after  starting  out  at  point 
A, the successive points may be encountered in a different 
order each time the scenario is played and various unknown 
endings may ultimately be reached. 

In creating a sandbox, the Keeper is establishing a “geog-
raphy”  for  the  game  wherein  numerous  interconnected  or 
separate plots can be set for the investigators to discover over 
the course of play. Should the players go off at a tangent, the 
Keeper is well-versed enough in the setting to accommodate 
the  developing  story.  Note  that  you  are  not  writing  a  story 
when  you  create  a  non-linear  scenario.  Above  all,  you  do 
not script an ending—avoid this at all costs! You may write 
a backstory, but it must stop where the game starts. What you 
are creating is plot elements (non-player characters, locations, 
etc.), but how these are woven together into a story is decided 
during play. You may also make a timeline of events that will 
take place in the story if the course of events is not altered by 
the investigators, but you must be ready to alter the events on 
the timeline according to the actions of the players.

Sometimes  the  players  will  miss  clues  or  head  down  a 
path  the  Keeper  did  not  foresee.    This  is  fine;  in  fact,  it  is 
better than fine, as some of the best parts of a game are those 
improvised in play. 

Non-linear  adventures  give  the  player's  choice  in  how  to 
proceed. The very fact that unexpected things will happen be-
cause of the players’ choices makes for a more exciting game for 
everyone—the Keeper included. In this sense, the story really 
does become a collaboration between the Keeper and players. 

The  King in Yellow, an avatar of Hastur

on and have decided to confront the big villain or at least 
have a workable solution to solve the mystery. All this comes 
to a climax, when the truth is (probably) revealed, the vil-
lain caught or dispatched, and some form of resolution is 
reached.

Linear adventures can be characterized like a car journey. 
If you know your destination you can plan a route—perhaps 
driving a certain way to take in some wonderful scenery. If 
you encounter bad traffic en route, you can make a detour. 
This  might  affect  your  journey  time  but  you’ll  still  get  to 
your  destination  in  the  end.  The  scenario  starts  at  point 
“A” and ends at point “E,” with the investigators journeying 
through points “B,” “C,” and “D” en route. 

Let’s take a look at one of the scenarios in this book—
Amidst  the  Ancient  Trees  (page  346).  The  scenario 
begins at point A, as the investigators are called to join 
a posse to find a missing girl. Point B would encompass 
the  various  scenes  that  may  be  encountered  before 
entering point C. The order in which the investigator’s 
play through the scenes is more-or-less up to them and 
the keeper, but eventually they will encounter the lake 
for the climax of the scenario (Point D).

As you can see, the plot is driven in one direction 
by  the  acquisition  of  clues  and  sparse  information. 
Think of it like a train track—the story can only go 
one  way. This  is  fine  for  novice  Keepers  and  players 
who  are  getting  to  grips  with  the  game.  However,  it 
relies on the players doing what is expected of them—
following the clues in the right order.

217 

chapter 10: playing the gameLet's  take  the  plot  of  well-known  horror  film,  John  Car-
penter’s  The  Thing,  as  the  basis  for  a  Call  of  Cthulhu 
scenario. The basic summary of the film is as follows:

The  crew  of  a  remote  Antarctic  research  facility  un-
wittingly  takes  in  a  shape-shifting  alien  that  proceeds  to 
murder and replicate members of the team. The alien has 
been  awoken  from  centuries  of  sleep  by  men  digging  in 
the ice and is now trying to survive while constructing a 
spacecraft to escape the Antarctic. 

These are the key ingredients of the story—there’s plen-
ty more going on, but this will be enough for now. Taking 
these ideas, let's rework the plot for Call of Cthulhu.

The Setup (“the mystery”):

A  team  of  researchers  from  Miskatonic  University 
is  called  to  investigate  the  disappearance  of  members  of 
an  archaeological  dig  in  the  Vermont  countryside.  The 
only  known  facts  are  that  the  archaeological  team  had 
discovered  the  remains  of  an  ancient  site  and  had  been 
conducting  the  dig  for  one  month. A  few  days  ago,  some 
local people visited the site only to discover the team had 
inexplicably  disappeared,  leaving  all  of  their  possessions 
and equipment.

What’s going on:

The team unearthed a stone tablet on which was in-
scribed the spell Summon/Bind Star Vampire and, unwit-
tingly, one of them cast the spell. The archaeological team 
were eaten by the monster (a star vampire), with only one 
survivor (we’ll call him Ted). While the spell worked, the 
summoned  star  vampire  was  not  bound  properly  and  so 
is free to do as it pleases. At the moment it is roaming the 
woods, randomly murdering the locals, livestock and wild-
life until it decides to transport itself back from whence it 
came. The missing bodies of the archeological team can be 
found in the woods near the dig site—such discoveries can 
be made by the local police and/or the investigators. Ted is 
also roaming the woods, having fled the monster’s attack. 
He has lost his mind and is insane. Star vampires are invis-
ible most of the time, so no one knows who is carrying out 
the murders, and suspicion falls upon Ted.

So, we have a relatively isolated location (enough for 
the  investigators  to  feel  they  are  on  their  own,  but  close 

enough to civilization for a range of non-player characters 
to be introduced (local farmers, the police, etc.) We have a 
reason for a team of investigators to be there (let’s assume 
the investigators can be from Miskatonic University) and 
we have a nasty monster! 

How to solve it:

Once at the site, the investigators will need to explore 
the dig site, examine the remains of those murdered, ques-
tion  the  locals,  and  ultimately  discover  the  stone  tablet, 
before  learning  the  spell  properly  and  casting  it  to  dispel 
the monster. While trying to do this, all sorts of craziness 
occurs  as  the  monster  is  on  the  loose  and  is  working  its 
way  around  the  local  farms,  killing  livestock  and  people. 
Meanwhile,  Ted  is  being  hunted  by  the  police  as  suspect 
number one. It is up to the investigators to save Ted and 
banish or kill the monster.

Three potential endings (just examples, there are many 

more):

T Some of the investigators engage the monster in 
combat as others chant the spell at the site. As it 
kills its second investigator, the spell takes effect 
and the creature is banished.

T  The  star  vampire  uses  its  magic  to  control  the 
local policeman, who leads the investigators into 
a trap, leading to a chaotic scene that ends with 
half of the investigators dead and the remaining 
ones fleeing madly into the night.

T  The  investigators  discover  the  stone  tablet  and 
destroy  it,  believing  it  to  be  the  source  of  the 
evil. They may have just signed their own death 
warrants!

As  you  can  see,  from  the  simple  idea  of  a  monster 
attacking  a  research  team,  you  can  begin  to  construct  a 
scenario,  adding  as  many  bells  and  whistles  as  you  like. 
As  in  The  Thing,  the  investigators  aren’t  the  ones  who 
unleash  the  monster;  instead  they  have  to  research  what 
happened to the original team and try to fix the mess they 
find themselves in.

Campaigns
If a scenario were likened to an episode of a television series, 
a campaign would be a season or perhaps an entire series. A 
published campaign is divided into chapters, each of which 
might be considered one scenario. The chapters are linked 
with  a  common  theme  or  story-arc.  Depending  on  the 
campaign, the chapters may need to be completed in a set 
order or there may be a flexibility to accommodate playing 
the chapters in different orders, depending on the actions of 
the investigators.

First, think up several scenario plots, each only two or 
three  layers  deep.  With  three  or  four  scenarios  in  mind, 

think  about  how  they  might  connect  to  a  central  horror 
or  mystery.  The  players  start  out  fooling  around  with  the 
very edges of the Mythos, where there are dozens of myths, 
legends, clues, and adventures. As they gain more knowledge 
and experience, the investigators will work their way inward, 
into stories of greater depth. After several such stories, the 
players  should  begin  to  see  the  links  between  the  various 
scenarios. At the center of the mystery lies the hideous truth 
and the climax of the campaign.

There should be hoaxes and meaningless trails sprinkled 
among the scenarios. These will keep your world from de-
generating into a mass of monsters and their kin. Gamblers,

When preparing a sandbox scenario, 
you don’t need to write lengthy 
descriptions of each locale. Just a 
few bullet-points about each will 
suffice to act as reminder. Your 
notes should include possible clues 
to be found and how they connect 
to other non-player characters or 
locations. Non-player characters 
don’t need to have all their skills

points and relationships to other 
characters should suffice.

entrepreneurs,  venal  labor  bosses,  terrorists,  movie  stars, 
nefarious  politicians,  and  piratical  sea  captains  are  also 
available. An  occasional  scenario  with  dangers  originating 
from this (mundane) world might divert your players, but 
keep in mind that the main theme of the game is the inves-
tigators’ struggle against the Cthulhu Mythos. 

Within  each  scenario  you  prepare,  sprinkle  additional 
information  that  relates  to  the  “big  picture”—the  main 
plot and what is really happening in the background. As the 
investigators  work  through  the  scenarios,  these  disparate 
pieces  of  information  should  begin  to  form  connections, 
driving the investigators to pursue new lines of enquiry and 
leading them ever deeper into the main plot until they reach 
a point of realization as to what is really going on and who 
the  real  enemy  is.  This  point  of  realization  from  various 
disassociated clues should prepare the investigators for their 
biggest challenge and the climax of the campaign.

Chaosium  has  published  a  number  of  campaigns  for 
Call  of  Cthulhu,  including  Horror  on  the  Orient  Express 
and  The  Masks  of  Nyarlathotep.  If  you  are  you  new  to  the 
concept of campaigns then reading (and playing!) through 
a  published  campaign  will  give  you  a  good  grasp  of  how 
individual scenarios can be linked to form a campaign.

In one scenario, papers found in the old Starry Wis-
dom cult chapel in Boston could mention the Esoteric 
Order of Dagon. Later, in another scenario, investiga-
tions of swamp cults in Louisiana could unearth con-
nections to a master cult in New England, centered in 
Innsmouth, also called the Esoteric Order of Dagon.

Level of Detail
We’ve  looked  at  how  to  structure  linear  and  non-linear 
scenarios  and  campaigns,  but  what  should  a  finished  sce-
nario look like? The scenarios at the back of this book are 
by  different  authors,  each  with  their  own  style.  However, 
these are of course published scenarios and each has had to 
meet  certain  requirements  and  standards  that  may  not  be 
required for the homegrown scenario. 

Just as there is no single way to start when writing a sce-
nario, there is no prescribed end product. Compare creating 
a  scenario  with  making  a  speech. When  making  a  speech, 
some people are able to make it up on the spot with little or 
no preparation, while others make a few notes to improvise 
around and still others write the whole thing out word for 
word. These various levels of preparation can work equally 
well—there is no right or wrong here. The important thing 
is to know what level of detail you personally require. 

If you are writing a scenario, it might be no more than 
a  handful  of  notes.  If  you  are  new  to  running  games,  it  is 
unlikely  that  you  will  feel  confident  enough  to  use  this 
approach  initially.  If  used  successfully,  the  results  of  the 
"notes" approach can prove highly rewarding as the low level 
of preparation encourages greater improvisation, leading to 
more creative and unpredictable play. 

How to Use a Published Scenario
The great thing about a published scenario is that the work 
has been done for you and lots of detailed background and 
setting  material  is  provided  for  you  to  use.  Depending  on 
how you approach it, this can feel like a blessing or a burden. 
If  you  are  someone  who  can  read  a  large  quantity  of  text 
quickly, identify the salient points and retain the informa-
tion, then you are off to a flying start. Most of us, however, 
will find we forget certain parts, requiring us to break the 
flow of the game to consult the scenario text, clumsily leafing 
through the pages in search of those elusive but seemingly 
all-important details.

So  how  best  to  use  a  published  scenario?  To  start 
with,  leaf  through  the  scenario  and  gain  an  overview  of 
the  chapters  and  contents,  then  read  the  whole  document 
thoroughly from cover to cover once. You should now have 
a  good  understanding  of  what  the  scenario  is  about,  but 
you  may  still  be  hazy  on  some  of  the  details,  perhaps  not 
quite grasping the roles played by some of the non-player 
characters; this is fine. 

Next, work through the scenario again, this time taking 
notes.  Try  to  write  a  bare  minimum.  Avoid  superfluous 
detail or things that you feel confident that you’ll remember 

219 

chapter 10: playing the game220 

Call of Cthulhuanyway. Identify text that is simply adding color and reduce 
or omit it. For example, the text might describe a bedroom 
in  great  detail,  down  to  the  color  of  the  bedspread,  the 
wallpaper,  the  contents  of  the  bedside  cabinet  and  other 
furnishings. If you are confident that none of this informa-
tion is vital and that you can improvise a description of a 
similar  room  during  play  then  there  is  no  need  to  record 
the details in your notes. You are not doing the published 
adventure any disrespect—the printed text of the scenario 
has served its purpose in communicating to you, the reader, 
an image of the bedroom. When you run the game you will 
be  able  to  describe  a  bedroom  inspired  by  what  you  read 
in  the  scenario.  Whether  the  bedspread  is  pink  or  blue  is 
neither here nor there. What may be important is whether it 
is an opulent suite or a seedy motel room, and you will know 
this from having read the published text. 

Be sure to identify and note down anything that is es-
sential to the scenario. You will know what is important and 
what is not because you have read the scenario once already. 
Clearly if the scenario notes that there is a copy of the Cultes 
des Goules in the bedside cabinet then you need to note its 
presence. In your mind it might better be concealed under 
the bed or beneath a loose floorboard—the location is not 
important, only its presence.

To run a scenario effectively you need to feel ownership of 
it. After this second reading of the scenario, you should have 
a set of notes from which you can run the game in your own 
way. See how you have distilled a published scenario back to 
Keeper’s notes, perhaps similar to those used by the author 
when the game was run for the very first time. Use these notes 
as a framework and with your players you’ll create wonderful 
new stories that would amaze the scenario’s author!

A published scenario describes a room as follows:

Main bedroom: A comfortable bedroom with a 
large window overlooking the rear garden. Clothes 
lie  scattered  across  the  floor  and  the  room  would 
benefit from a good clean. A wooden bedside cab-
inet  contains  a  copy  of  the  Cultes  des  Goules  in  a 
locked drawer. 

Your notes might reduce this to:
Main  bedroom,  grubby,  hidden  Cultes  des 

Goules.

And Finally...
If  there’s  one  thing  you  need  above  all  others  to  make  this 
game  fun,  it  is  a  positive  enthusiasm  to  make  stuff  up  and 
create conflict and drama. That spark of life trumps all the 
rules  and  advice  that  anyone  can  give  you  on  how  to  run 
a  game.  On  its  own,  enthusiasm  will  not  make  you  a  great 
Keeper, but without it you will never be one. If anything in 
this  book  excited  you,  then  focus  on  that.  Get  fired  up,  get 
excited and share that with your players so that they feel it too.

Now go and have fun!

chapter 10: playing the game222 

Call of Cthulhuythos  tomes  are  the  repositories  of  arcane 
wisdom, terrible secrets, and powerful magic. 
They  provide  the  seeker  of  enlightenment 
with  stark  truths  about  reality,  existence,  and 
presence  of  those  from  outside.  For  the  un-
wary, such books delineate a path to nightmare, horror, and 
insanity.

This  chapter  summarizes  the  books  of  the  Cthulhu 
Mythos most often mentioned in the fiction of the Lovecraft 
Circle of writers. 

Describing Mythos Tomes
Some Mythos volumes are recent enough in origin to have 
been printed with movable type. Those editions were usu-
ally published privately in short press runs and only sold to 
rich  collectors  or  acquaintances.  Upon  publication,  copies 
often were sought out and destroyed by the authorities due 
to their scandalous nature. Better these texts be burned and 
suppressed. Such was the fate of the original publication of 
The King in Yellow. 

Where surviving copies exist, these have often have been 
ill-treated  by  the  crazed  or  malicious,  or  else  rebound  to 
disguise  their  blasphemous  contents.  Bound  manuscripts 
were  never  regularized  by  typesetting  and  printing,  and 
their wavering, blotted handwriting may be wholly incom-
prehensible for pages at a time, a situation remedied only by 
great dedication and scholarship.

Even though each book’s summary is uniform in these 
rules, assume that each copy of a Mythos book can be dif-
ferent  from  its  fellows.  Though  the  logic  of  that  potential 
diminishes  for  recent  books,  such  as  Azathoth  and  Others, 
even  then  bindings  may  be  broken,  pages  torn  out,  and 
signatures  missing  or  wrongly  collated.  Contents  may  be 
ink-stained or acid-scarred, with pages half-burnt and the 
words made illegible or utterly defaced by madmen (or by 
sane men who sought to destroy the dangerous information 
therein). Unique information may be written as marginalia 
or jotted down on notepaper and inserted here or there. 

Some  tomes  begin  to  possess  their  own “character”  as 
they  grow  in  age.  Passed  down  through  the  generations, 
between  family  members,  booksellers,  and  collectors,  the 
tomes seem to absorb an imprint of their owners. This can 
be  more  than  simply  the  wandering  marginalia  of  occult 
scholars,  with  some  books  apparently  manifesting  distinct 
“personalities”  that  echo  once-powerful  owners,  such  as 
grand sorcerers and cult potentates. Consider the smell, feel, 
and look of Mythos books. The overall impression ought to 
be distinctly unhealthy. The binding will probably be leath-
er, perhaps human or even that of some unworldly being. 
Does the leather leave a slimy residue when touched? Does 
the book leave a musky odor wherever it has been? Does the 
presence of the tome cause the pages of other, nearby books 
to char and blacken? Perhaps the book appears to move of 
its  own  accord,  never  to  be  found  where  the  investigator 
remembers placing it.

Sorcerers  and  cultists  are  not  librarians.  They  are  un-
concerned with the needs of posterity. They intend to live 

forever and they consider the knowledge contained within 
their  tomes  to  be  theirs  by  right—and  not  to  be  lightly 
passed to the unworthy.

Undiscovered Editions
If  an  original-language  version  is  found  of  a  work  that 
until then was known only in translation, then the original 
version  is  more  informative.  Add  a  few  percentiles  to  the 
Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  reward.  Treat  the  original  edition  as 
another  edition.  The  Keeper  chooses  the  book’s  original 
language and can make up its title in that language as well.

If  a  you  create  a  new  Mythos  tome  for  some  purpose, 
you should have a suitable name for it, know the language of 
its composition, know what it looks and feels like, know how 
many Sanity points are lost in reading it, know how many 
Cthulhu Mythos points its comprehension adds, and be able 
to determine what spells (if any) can be found within it.

Using Mythos Tomes
Despite the dangers, investigators will choose to study this or 
that terrifying book. The process of reading can be leisurely 
and can be suspended at any point for as long as need be.

Consider  that  each  book  is  a  potential  conduit  of 
Mythos power and energy—a physical and mental portal to 
the madness of secrets beyond the reasoning of mortal man. 
Books  of  power  may  exert  a  dark  influence  on  those  who 
possess them, stoking their desire for blasphemous knowl-
edge,  kindling  a  fascination  for  the  occult,  and  ultimately 
driving the owner to delve deep into the Mythos and court 
insanity.  In  many  Lovecraftian  stories,  the  protagonist  is 
thrown headfirst into the horrors of the Mythos as a result 
of some Mythos artifact or tome.

Akin  to  spells,  Mythos  tomes  can  unbalance  a  game  if 
used too freely. Such books are a conduit for Cthulhu Mythos 
knowledge and spells, providing the investigators with a po-
tential source of great power in combating the machinations 
of the Mythos. If everywhere the investigators turn they find 
a Mythos tome, then the game can become predictable and 
the challenge lessened. Obtaining a Mythos book could be 
a scenario in itself, or at least a suitably dangerous sidetrack 
to a campaign, allowing the investigators to gain secrets that 
help them in their quest against the minions of the Mythos. 
This power and knowledge comes at a price. In Call of 
Cthulhu, this usually means an increasing descent into mad-
ness. While  players  will  desire  to  gain  Mythos  books,  they 
should  also  fear  them,  due  to  the  terrible  sanity  depleting 
effect they will have on their investigators. 

Investigator possession of a Mythos tome should always 
carry a consequence. This may simply be the cost in sanity, as 
described above, or some other story-related consequence. 
Try to devise corrupted investigator background entries 
that drive the story forward. Think about how the investi-
gator’s relationship with the Mythos tome could be manip-
ulated  to  compel  the  game’s  narrative,  add  further  depth 
to  the  investigator,  and  suggest  roleplaying  opportunities 
to the player concerned. While other investigators view the 

224 

Call of CthulhuMythos tome in question as a smelly, evil-looking book, the 
investigator  who  has  become  corrupted  by  it  will  see  it  in 
a  quite  different  light. An  investigator  may  feel  compelled 
to hide the book away in case it gets “hurt,” or perhaps the 
deluded investigator cannot read another book without the 
tome’s text burning through the print. 

The tome is trying to get back to what “it” considers as 
its rightful owner by sending out messages in the form 
of dark dreams in the hope that its master will find 
it. While the investigators suffer from hideous night-
mares, the book’s true owner is closing in and waiting 
for a chance to take back what was stolen. 

Possible corrupted investigator background entries:
T  The  tome  is  a  source  of  secrets  I  must  know— 

I must learn more!

T  No one is allowed to touch my book.
T  The book speaks to me and I must obey.
T  The book is evil, and so am I for reading it.
T  Wherever I put the book it kills anything near to it.
T  The  book  is  changing  me—I  hunger  for  human 

flesh!

The Mythos tome has proved to be most useful, par-
ticularly to the investigator who read it (gaining some 
points  in  the  Cthulhu  Mythos  skill  and  a  couple  of 
spells). However, the loss of sanity caused by reading 
tome  is  manifesting  as  an  unhealthy  obsession  with 
the  book.  The  Keeper  decides  to  give  the  investigator 
a  new “corrupted”  entry  in  their  background  (under 
Treasured Possessions): “Will not part with the Book 
of Iod, takes it wherever he goes.” 

Mythos books may also provide the inspiration for in-
vestigator delusions (see Insanity side-effects 2: Delusions 
and Reality Checks, page 162). Perhaps the book somehow 
influences the investigator or the investigator sees the book 
everywhere—even  though  it  was  apparently  destroyed. 
Delusions centered on a Mythos tome can have all manner 
of effects upon the investigators, whether to throw them off-
track or guide them through insane insight.

A Note About the Entries
Information about the tomes described may be known by 
erudite  bibliophiles,  historians,  and  by  a  few  in  the  rare 
book  trade.  While  it  is  unlikely  that  such  books  will  be 
found  on  the  shelves  of  the  common  public  library,  some 

can be found in the rare book sections of certain universities 
and in private collections. Apart from those listed, other ver-
sions, as well as lesser Mythos works exist, as do incidental 
notebooks, diaries, and letters. Keepers are advised to review 
the entries for inspiration when designing new volumes of 
forgotten lore, cultist notebooks, and so on.

Where  two  dates  are  noted  for  multiple  Mythos  books: 
the latter date in each case is the date ascribed in the original 
story. Some dates are conjectural. If available at all, the num-
ber of copies listed reflects those known to be held in public 
and private collections. More existing copies are very likely. 

Dimensions given are traditional, since actual sizes often 
vary between copies. Folios range from 12.5" × 20" to 10" 
×  15".  Quartos  vary  between  10"  ×  12.5"  and  7.5"  ×  10". 
Octavos range between 6.25" × 10" and 5" × 7.5".

The  summaries  also  include  average  weeks  of  study  per 
book. When using such numbers, take into account the indi-
vidual reader’s skills and profession. Use the times and dates 
given here as comparative indicators of difficulty. Each inves-
tigator will study and comprehend a book at a different rate.

Egyptians are thought to have come 
into possession of the Book of Eibon 
through trading with fabled Atlantis. 
Survivors of the great Atlantian 
disaster are also thought to have       
carried the book with them, inscribed 
on tablets, to many parts of Europe, 
including Ireland, France, and Greece.

Through a pact with Tsathoggua,       
Eibon gained greater knowledge and 
power, and even went so far as to 
discover a way to pass through the 
seals of the god’s throne room under 
Mount Voormithadreth to personally 
visit him. 

In fear of his power, the priests 
of Yhoundeth drove a campaign of               
persecution against Eibon, finally causing 
him to flee through a “door” that led 
to Saturn. Despite the years since this 
happened, wanderers of dreams and other 
places have, from time to time, mentioned 
meeting an ancient sage called Eibon. 
Whether this is one and the same remains 
conjecture.

as vampires, sprites, and elementals. Certain 
copies of the tome have large sections 
written in what is considered to be Ogham 
(Druidic runes). Some suspect the Ogham 
is a cipher used by Prinn to “hide” more 
revealing and blasphemous ideas. Rumors 
circulated in the early twentieth century 
concerning the Esoteric Order of Dagon, who 
were allegedly seeking an original copy of the 
book. It is believed that within the ciphered 
sections are formulae to hasten the  
metamorphosis of a human into a deep one. 

Comprising pottery shards 
discovered near Eltdown, Southern 
England, the Eltdown Shards were 
declared untranslatable by Dr. Woodford 
and Dalton (the first to attempt a 
translation). Subsequently, however, 
numerous manuscripts purporting to be    
translations have appeared, with the 
Winters-Hall version foremost among 
them. Winters-Hall suggests that the 
Shards are none other than the writings 
of the elder things, buried when England 
was still part of the super continent of 
Pangaea. Speculation against this theory 
has arisen from unnamed sources who 
contest that the script is that of the 
Great Race of Yith.

Eltdown Shards 
English, by Rev. Arthur Brooke Winters-Hall, 1912
Questionable  translation  of  mysterious  hieroglyphs  found 
on clay fragments in southern England, in an edition of 350 
pamphlets,  64  pages.  Tells  of  beings  that  could  exchange 
minds with others across space and time.

The King in Yellow
English, translator unknown, c. 1895
The original is in French, apparently, but that edition was 
seized and destroyed by the Third Republic just after pub-
lication. The English edition is a thin black octavo volume, 
across the front cover of which is embossed a large Yellow 
Sign.  Until  the  book  has  been  read,  the  Sign  has  no  effect 
on  the  viewer,  except  to  imbue  a  sense  of  curiosity.  After 
reading the book (or after having contact with anything or 
anyone from Carcosa), viewing the sign costs 0/1D6 Sanity 
points to see (for one time only). The text is an ambiguous, 
dreamlike  play  that  opens  readers  to  madness.  Uniquely, 
readers cannot opt to disbelieve what is written here. Those 
of an artistic bent will feel compelled to reread the play. If 
the book results in insanity, the reader should become ob-
sessed with Carcosa and the King in Yellow (see Yellow Sign, 
page 322).

A play shrouded in mystery and  
sorrow, The King in Yellow appears to 
bring only madness and death to those 
who possess the volume. Although the  
playwright remains unknown, some 
maintain it was written by Christopher 
Marlowe (author of Doctor Faustus, as 
well as the lurid The Massacre at Paris). 
Apart from his known works, Marlowe is 
also famous for his mysterious death. 
An arrest warrant for Marlowe was 
issued, with no reason given other than 
allegations of blasphemy for a manuscript 
containing “vile heretical concepts”. He 
was taken for questioning, although 
(strangely) no record exists of the  
interview. Ten days later Marlowe was 
stabbed (above the right eye, killing him 
instantly) by Ingram Frizer. Some believe 
the blasphemous manuscript to be The 
King in Yellow and the real cause of 
Marlowe’s death.

Call of CthulhuThe Necronomicon

Every tome has its own history and the Keeper is invited to 
use this entry regarding the Necronomicon as inspiration for 
his or her own stories of other tomes or similar artifacts.

While  more  ancient  works  are  hinted  at,  in  human  lan-
guages it is the Necronomicon that best relates the reach and 
meaning of the Cthulhu Mythos.

The Necronomicon is encyclopedic and baffling, contain-
ing deep Mythos magic and knowledge, including a chant to 
Yog-Sothoth  which  can  open  the  Way  to  this  world,  infor-
mation on the powder of Ibn-Ghazi, and a description of the 
Voorish Sign. The tome also discusses the nature of existence, 
details many locations and places (some not of this Earth), 
and  provides  grim  descriptions  of  some  Mythos  entities. 
Allusions are definitions, inflections are explanations, wishes 
are proofs, and decoration and design are indistinguishable. 
The vocabulary is as interior as that of a dream. The Necro-
nomicon is the gateway to insanity, the path through which 
humans pass, metamorphose, and emerge unrecognizable.

History 

The original version of the Necronomicon, known as the Kitab 
Al Azif, was written around 730 A.D. in Damascus by the Arab, 
Abdul Al-Hazred (Abd al-Azrad). A student of magic as well as 
an astronomer, poet, philosopher, and scientist, al-Azrad was 
born around 700 A.D. in Sanaa, Yemen. Before composing his 
great work he spent years visiting the ruins of Babylon, the pits 
of Memphis, and the great southern desert of Arabia.

He died in Damascus in 738, according to his 12th-centu-
ry biographer, Ebn Khallikan, devoured in broad daylight by 
an invisible demon. Manuscripts of the Al Azif circulated se-
cretly among philosophers and scientists of the age, however 
it was not until the year 950 that the work was translated into 
Greek by the Byzantine Theodorus Philetas, who renamed it 
the Necronomicon. Numerous copies of Philetas’ manuscript 
were  made.  The  increased  circulation  of  the  blasphemous 
tome led to its eventual condemnation in 1050 by the Patri-
arch Michael of Constantinople. Many copies were confiscat-
ed and destroyed, their owners suffering harsh penalties.

In  1228,  Olaus  Wormius  effected  a  Latin  translation  of 
the Greek version, all copies of the original Arabic having by 
this time been lost. Its rapid circulation among philosophical 
circles led to its banning in 1232, both the Latin and Greek 
versions placed on the Index Expurgatorius by Pope Gregory 
IX.  Olaus  did  not  re-title  the  Greek  Necronomicon,  and  the 
work is thereafter commonly referred to by that name.

The year 1454 saw the first practical printing press using 
moveable type and, before the end of the century, a black-let-
ter  version  of  the  Latin  Necronomicon  had  been  printed  in 
Germany, probably in Mainz. The text does not identify the 
date or place of printing.

In  the  early  sixteenth  century,  probably  before  1510,  a 
version of the Greek translation was printed in Italy. Although 
again lacking any identifying marks, this version is generally 
believed  to  have  come  from  the  press  of  Aldus  Manutius, 
founder of the Aldine Press, famous for its printing of unedit-
ed Greek and Latin texts.

In 1586 an English translation of the Necronomicon was 
produced  by  Dr.  John  Dee,  mathematician,  astrologer,  and 
physician  to  Queen  Elizabeth  of  England.  Never  published, 
Dee’s translation is believed to have been made from a Greek 
edition discovered by the doctor during his travels in Eastern 
Europe. Although accurate, it is incomplete, partially expur-
gated by its translator.

A second printing of the Latin version was made in Spain 
in the early seventeenth century. As usual, the printer is un-
identified but the poorer cut of the type distinguishes it from 
the finer German work. It is in all other ways faithful to the 
earlier edition.

Other Versions 

Other versions and partial copies of the Necronomicon exist. 
The  Sussex  Manuscript,  also  known  as  the  Cultus  Malefi-
carum,  is  an  English  translation  made  by  a  Baron  Frederic 
from the Latin text, published in Sussex in 1597. The mud-
dled  and  incomplete  Al-Azif—Ye  Booke  of  ye  Arab,  written 
in provincial English, was made in the late sixteenth century 
and  circulated  in  hand-copied  manuscript.  The  116-page 
medieval Voynich Manuscript, presently in the collection of 
the University of Pennsylvania, is written in Greek and Latin 
using Arab script. 

Surviving Copies 

Condemned  and  destroyed  by  the  Church,  only  five  copies 
of  the  Necronomicon  are  known  to  exist  today,  although 
an  unknown  number  of  copies  may  still  be  held  in  private 
collections.  Copies  that  reach  the  open  market  are  usually 
purchased  by  libraries  or  private  collectors.  The  resultant 
increase  in  value  has  driven  the  price  beyond  the  range  of 
most serious students of the occult. Few can afford to obtain 
their own copies of this dark and powerful book, and, given 
the  value  and  fragile  conditions  of  the  existing  copies,  few 
public institutions allow unrestricted access.

The documented extant copies are all Latin versions, four 
from the surreptitious 17th-century Spanish printing and the 
fifth  a  single  surviving  specimen  of  the  fine  16th-century 
German edition. The four remnants of the edition printed in 
Spain are presently held in the collections of the Bibliothèque 
Nationale  in  Paris,  the  Miskatonic  University  Library  in 
Arkham, the Widener Library at Harvard, and the library of 
the University of Buenos Aires. The precious single copy of 
the edition printed in Germany resides in the British Museum 
in London.

chapter 11: Tomes of Eldritch LoreContinued from following page

Although the last known copy in Greek is believed to have 
perished in flames during the chaos of the Salem witch trials 
in Massachusetts, rumors of other Greek copies occasionally 
surface.  The  most  recent  of  these  claimed  that  a  copy  was 
owned by the New York artist Richard Upton Pickman. If true, 
the book apparently disappeared along with the artist in 1926.
Handmade copies of the Dee version, most of them dam-
aged  and  incomplete,  are  still  occasionally  unearthed.  The 
most recent find was made by Miskatonic University, which 
now has a nearly complete Dee Necronomicon in its enviable 
collection. The decidedly less rare Sussex Manuscript also can 
be found in Miskatonic’s collection and in many other large 
libraries as well. It is generally believed that no copies of the 
Arabic  original  have  survived  to  the  present  day,  although 
persistent rumors suggest that a copy surfaced in San Francis-
co shortly before the disastrous earthquake and fire of 1906. 
The claim that an Arabic copy is part of the collection in the 
British Museum has been recently disproved.

Physical Descriptions 

All  known  printed  editions  of  the  Necronomicon  are  fo-
lio-sized.  The  Latin  editions  printed  in  Spain  and  Germany 
measure  18  by  11-1/2  inches  and  contain  802  pages,  one 
leaf being bound in as a tabbed insert. Records suggest that 
the  Greek  version  was  several  pages  longer.  The  type  style 
is  black-letter  gothic  and  numerous  woodcuts  illustrate  the 
text. Bindings, as with all books of this period, are individual, 
reflecting the tastes of the books’ original owners. 

The  Necronomicon  found  in  the  British  Museum  is  in  a 
15th-century leather binding still in fair condition. Printed in 
Germany, the text is in good condition but lamentably lacks 

seven different leaves, each cut away and removed with great 
care.  This  volume  was  among  the  three  libraries  of  books 
bequeathed to the people of England that led to the founding 
of the British Museum in 1753.

The copy found in the Bibliothèque Nationale is in poor 
condition,  bound  in  the  cheap,  crumbling  pasteboards 
common  to  the  era.  The  text  is  in  similarly  bad  condition, 
with many torn pages and several pages missing altogether. 
Other pages are indecipherable, badly stained by what some 
identify as blood. The acquisition of the book is shrouded in 
mystery, the volume deposited at the front desk in 1811 by a 
furtive man of foreign caste. The mysterious donor was found 
a day later in a rat-infested apartment, a victim of poison.

The University of Buenos Aires’ copy is said to have come 
to  South  America  in  the  late  17th  century.  Although  the 
text is in only fair condition, it is unique for its odd marginal 
notes, written in unknown glyphs.

The Widener Library at Harvard contains a Necronomicon 
of poor condition. Its binding is original, but badly cracked 
and split. The text is complete but many pages have separated 
and others are crumbling. Restoration efforts are underway. 
The  book  was  part  of  the  library  of  Harry  Elkins  Widener, 
American millionaire, and it is said that he obtained the vol-
ume shortly before he boarded the Titanic in 1912. 

The  copy  at  Miskatonic  University  was  obtained  late  in 
the last century by a young Dr. Armitage, then only recently 
hired by the school. Purchased from the private collection of 
Providence  businessman  Whipple  Phillips,  the  Miskatonic’s 
edition  of  the  Necronomicon  was  rebound,  probably  in  the 
early  18th  century,  in  sumac-tanned  goatskin.  A  false  title, 
Qanoon-e-Islam, is embossed in gold on the front cover. The 
text is complete and in fair to good condition.

nine folio volumes are held by many major libraries. Each

During the federal investigation of  
Innsmouth in 1927-8, copies of the       
R’lyeh Text were seized. During  
interviews with those apprehended in the 
raids, it became apparent that the slim 
book was considered by the inhabitants of 
Innsmouth to be an important holy text. 
Further questioning of reluctant prisoners 
elicited information suggesting that the book 
contained the proper rites and obeisances to 
“Him in the Water” and that (more  
fancifully), the book held a secret that  
allowed men to speak with the fish and 
breathe under the water.
No record exists of what happened 
to the numerous volumes of the R’lyeh 
Text seized during the investigation. It is 
assumed they were destroyed.

Zanthu Tablets
English, by Prof. Harold Hadley Copeland, 1916
A brochure subtitled “A Conjectural Translation” printed in 
400 copies. Translates carvings found on black jade tablets 
drawn up from the Pacific Ocean by fishermen. The author 
claims the carvings are hieratic Naacal, the high language of 
ancient Mu. The brochure describes the worship of Ghatan-
othoa, Shub-Niggurath, and Cthulhu.

Suggested  Spells:  the  text  is  partially  expurgated  and 
contains no spells. The original Muvian tables con-
tain Contact Deity/Cthulhu, Ghatanothoa, Lloigor, 
Yuggya, and Zoth-Ommog.

Occult Books
Owners of Mythos tomes are likely also to own occult (non-
Mythos) volumes.

An  occult  book  usually  adds  at  least  one  point  to  the 
Occult  skill  after  reading.  There  are  thousands  of  occult 
volumes. Here is a small sampling for Keepers to use on the 
bookshelves of libraries, collectors, and cults.

Reading  an  occult  book  usually  costs  no  Sanity.  Oth-
erwise  the  same  rules  apply  to  occult  books  as  to  Mythos 
books. No indication for time of reading has been given; the 
Keeper should assign the relative interval he or she deems 
appropriate to the book.

Keepers are free to add a Mythos spell in a margin or on 
a flyleaf (written the crabbed handwriting of some scholar 
or  cultist)  if  they  think  it  appropriate,  but  (except  for  the 
Malleus  Maleficarum)  the  tone  of  these  volumes  is  often 
anything but evil or dangerous.

Beatus Methodivo
Latin, attributed to St. Methodius of Olympus, c. 300 AD
Of  Gnostic  complexion,  this  relatively  short  work  is  writ-
ten as a prophetic apocalypse. It foresees the history of the 
world. It recounts how Seth sought a new country in the East 
and came to the country of the initiates, how the children of 
Cain instituted a system of black magic in India.

thor or authors unknown, c. 200 AD

chapter 11: Tomes of Eldritch Lore240 

Call of CthulhuSpells

he  spells  described  within  the  Grimoire  are 
listed alphabetically, each detailing the standard 
purpose and result of a successful casting. Keep-
ers  are  encouraged  to  further  develop,  alter, 
and enhance the spells listed here. A spell may 
be found in a tome that produces a weaker effect than that 
stated in the Grimoire; equally, more powerful versions may 
be encountered. 

The Keeper should modify spells according to the needs 
of a particular scenario or campaign. Care should be taken 
when  creating  more  powerful  versions  of  the  spells  and 
putting them into the hands of the investigators. Such de-
vices often unbalance the game and it should be noted that 
spell-craft is the realm of insane wizards steeped in the lore 
of the Mythos. Spells should never be considered mundane 
within  the  world  of  the  game.  These  are  not  superpowers 
to be used lightly by investigators, and meddling with such 
otherworldly  forces  is  likely  to  cripple  the  unwary  user  in 
both mind and body. Further advice on how to alter spells is 
offered in Spell Variations (see nearby).

The Keeper should take careful note of which investigators 
know magic. An investigator  might cast a spell involuntarily 
while under the Keeper’s control during a bout of madness.

Spell Names
While each spell has a standard name, Keepers are strongly 
advised  to  use  more  evocative  titles  wherever  possible.  Dif-
ferent Mythos tomes may contain common spells; however, 
such  authors  will  have  comprehended  the  spells  quite  dif-
ferently, one author naming the spell Contact Deep One as 
“The Voice from the Deeps” for example, and another calling 
it “Summon the Abyssal Foulness.” Different spells may even 
have the same or similar names. Suggestions for alternative 
names are provided at the end of each spell’s description.

Deeper Magic
The path to Mythos wisdom and knowledge leads to insanity. 
Sanity gauges a person’s hold on what we term "reality," which 
is not reality at all but only a consensual human delusion or 
limited understanding that protects the mind from that which 
it cannot fully comprehend: the Cthulhu Mythos. Mythos mag-
ic is antithetical and corrosive to human sanity; the casting of 
spells will eat away at sanity, gradually disintegrating the caster’s 
link to the human world until the day comes when the Mythos 
is all that remains. A cultist’s ultimate aim is to relinquish all 
trace of human sanity and replace it with an understanding of 
the true nature of the universe. The loss of all sanity would in-
capacitate most people, leaving them unable to function in any 
meaningful way. However some cultists achieve this paradigm 
shift without being reduced to gibbering wrecks; even though 
they have zero Sanity points, they somehow transcend insanity 
and are still able to function and, in some cases, are capable of 
blending unnoticed with society at large.

Insane wizards, who fully embrace the Mythos, are likely to 
draw upon far greater power than a person who is simply cast-
ing a spell learned from a book. Liberated from human sanity 
and empowered by their understanding of the Mythos, these 
wizards are able to discover new aspects and deeper magics. In-
vestigators may also learn these deeper levels of understanding. 
Whenever an investigator is insane (temporary or indefinite) 
and successfully casts a spell, roll 1D100 and compare the result 
with the investigator’s Cthulhu Mythos skill. If the roll is equal 
to or below the investigator’s skill, new depths of magic have 
been  successfully  plumbed  and  the  option  to  use  the  deeper 
effect of the spell now presents itself. Once the deeper version 
of a spell is discovered, it remains available thereafter. Whether 
there are further deeper levels of the spell to be discovered in 
the future is a matter for the Keeper to decide.

All  spells  have  these  hidden  depths.  Deeper  versions  of 
many spells in this Grimoire are provided as examples. Keepers 
are advised to plan ahead when introducing spells that might 
fall into the hands of investigators and predetermine possible 
deeper magical effects of such spells rather than try to invent 
them on the fly.

Deeper Magic in Play
All Mythos entities and cultists with zero Sanity points will, 
if they know a certain spell, also know the deeper versions as 
listed in the Grimoire. Other enemies may know them at the 
Keeper’s discretion. The Keeper should not feel obliged to 
roll to determine whether the enemy learns a deeper version 
during play.

When an investigator discovers a deeper effect of a spell 
through play, the Keeper may decide how it differs from the 
standard version. The section on Spell Variations may prove 
useful. Essentially the deeper version should be an exciting 
(and more horrific) development of the spell rather than a 
mundane mechanical benefit (such as the spell costing fewer 
magic points). You may ask the player how the spell might 
be  altered;  remember  however  that  this  is  a  horror  game, 
and the deeper version may add aspects to the spell that are 
undesirable to the investigator. Greater magic should come 
with a greater price.

Spell Variations
There is no such thing as a definitive spell. The ones listed 
here are only a guide and starting point for the Keeper to 
draw upon. This is not a game in which the players can ex-
pect their characters to gain spells as a matter of course. The 
players  should  be  aware  that  any  spells  their  investigators 
gain may vary from the ones listed in this book. Part of the 
Keeper’s job is to act as intermediary between this Grimoire 
and the players.

242 

Call of CthulhuMaking Alterations to  
Listed Spells
A spell is made up of three parts: a cost, a description, and 
an effect. Cost and effect have a direct mechanical impact on 
the game that may include sanity loss, physical damage, loss 
of magic points, permanent change to characteristics, and 
so  forth. You  are  free  to  alter  these  things,  although  some 
careful consideration is required; placing a cheap, powerful 
spell into the hands of the players can have a dramatic effect 
upon  play.  Description,  on  the  other  hand,  is  simply  dra-
matic color and can be changed with relative ease.

Opposed POW Rolls
Many spells call for a POW roll to be made to test whether 
the spell affects its target. Both sides make a POW roll and 
compare their levels of success, with the higher one being 
the victor. In the case of a tie, the higher POW wins; if the 
sides are still drawn, the Keeper might decide that both are 
affected adversely in some manner that reflects the nature of 
the spell. If the difference between the caster’s POW and the 
target’s POW is 100 or more, the one with the greater POW 
automatically wins.

Spell Range
In the game, spell range is usually one of three options: touch, 
100 yards, or sight with the unaided eye. These general choic-
es  are  easy  to  visualize  and  understand.  Greater  ranges  can 
become engineering problems, not examples of horror. 

Casting Time and Spells in 
Combat
Some spells are useful in combat situations. Each spell has a 
casting time listed in its description: instantaneous, 1 round, 
and so on. 

If  the  casting  time  is  instantaneous,  it  activates  on  the 

user’s DEX+50 (just like a readied gun).

If the casting takes one round, it activates on the user’s 

DEX in the present round.

If the casting takes two rounds, it activates on the user’s 

DEX in the following round, and so on.

Altering a Spell’s Costs and Effects
The spell cost is usually gauged in magic points and Sanity 
points; however, some cases (where an effect is long-lasting 
and/or  highly  significant)  may  also  include  a  permanent 
expenditure  of  POW.  When  altering  the  cost,  you  should 
consider  any  changes  you  intend  to  make  to  the  effect.  A 
more  powerful  effect  is  likely  to  increase  the  cost,  while  a 
lesser effect may lower it. 

The source from which a spell is learned can affect both 
the cost and the effect; the purer the source, the better the 
spell. There is no set ratio of spell cost to effect in this game. 
A poorer source, such as a badly translated and incomplete 
tome, may provide a lesser version of a spell with a reduced 
effect and increased cost. A spell imparted directly from a 
Great Old One to the mind of a character might have greatly 
increased effects and/or greatly reduced costs.

Altering a Spell
Try  to  insert  some  personal  touches  to  the  spell,  tying  it 
more  strongly  to  your  scenario,  investigators,  and  story,  if 
possible.

Location:  consider  the  locations  in  your  story;  could 
one of them be linked to the spell? If the investigators are 
dealing with ghouls, for example, a spell that must be cast 
underground suddenly takes on an added dimension.

Spell  components:  the  specific  items  required  to  cast 
the spell. Could it be that the investigators need the curved 
silver dagger they saw in the previous session at the British 
Museum?

Spell ritual: a greater spell effect usually means a more 
complex  and  involved  ritual.  Consider  where,  when,  and 
how  the  spell  is  cast.  Do  the  investigators  have  to  daub 
themselves in blood at the full moon and inscribe a ritual 
circle?

Spell description: this can range from subtle to dramatic. 
Try to imbue the description with strange smells, disorient-
ing visions, curious sounds, and disturbing sensations—re-
member that most of these spells erode the caster’s sanity, 
and the way in which you describe the casting should make 
this manifest.

An Example of One Spell with Variations
A spell could be compared with a cooking recipe. There is 
no  definitive  bread  recipe;  soda  bread  can  be  made  in  an 
hour while sourdough bread takes days. A variety of flours 
and other ingredients may be used. The methods of making 
can  vary;  it  can  be  done  by  hand  or  with  a  machine.  The 
resulting breads come in all shapes, sizes, and flavors. If you 
look at ten cookbooks, you will find many differing recipes 
for bread with many different names. The same is true for 
spells and tomes.

Ten tomes might list what appears at first glance to be 
the same spell; however, the specific spells will be no more 
similar  than  all  those  bread  recipes—there  is  a  world  of 
difference  between  German  black  bread  and  focaccia.  Just 
as you would choose a bread that suits your menu, so you 
may tailor a spell to fit your game. Let’s take the spell Create 
Zombie and look at a few variations. 

The Basic Create Zombie Spell

The Create Zombie spell in the Grimoire starts with a corpse 
and coverts it to a zombie. The zombie lasts until it rots or 
falls to pieces. It can take basic commands from its creator. 
The magic point cost is high (16 points) and the Sanity loss 

243 

chapter 12: grimoire(1D6) moderate. The spell takes a whole week, but will work 
and is not subject to any POW rolls.

A Quick Version of the Create Zombie Spell

It  is  conceivable  that  the  players  might  wish  to  make  a 
zombie, perhaps to carry out some dangerous task on their 
behalf. If the investigators come across a tome that is poorly 
transcribed,  incomplete,  or  damaged,  you  might  want  to 
provide them with a version of the spell which seems useful, 
but is likely to cause them more trouble than it is worth. 

Alternatively  you  might  want  to  kick  a  scenario  off 
with a Re-animator theme: a mad doctor bringing corpses 
back to life, only to find they are beyond control. The cost 
of such a spell might be halved, as it is far less useful than 
the  standard  version.  The  idea  of  starting  with  a  corpse 
that continues to rot is retained, as is the sanity loss, yet 
the casting time is reduced to one hour. The apparent ad-
vantage of faster casting and lower magic point cost might 
well appeal to the unwary. Let’s call this version of the spell 
Grey Binding.

An Improved Version of the Create Zombie Spell

What if a warlock had the original Create Zombie spell, 
but wanted a more effective servant, one that would last 
longer, one that might even pass for human? The warlock’s 
aim might be beneficent; he may even be trying to bring 
back a loved one, such as a wife or child. 

All this would of course raise the cost of the spell and, 
as it is longer-lasting, the cost might be in POW instead of 
magic points—let’s call it 5 POW. The Sanity cost might 
also be raised to 1D10, justified in the description of the 

Grey Binding 
(Create Zombie Variant)

Cost: 8 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 hour 

A  ritual  liquid  must  be  poured  over  a  prepared 
corpse. The ingredients of the liquid differ depending 
on the version of the spell; however, the blood of the 
sorcerer  appears  common  to  all.  Other  ingredients 
should  be  determined  by  the  Keeper  (at  least  one 
should  be  costly  or  illegal,  or  perhaps  radioactive). 
Immediately after, the caster intones the spell. 

Following  the  ritual,  the  corpse  rouses.  Literally 
mindless,  the  zombie  is  akin  to  a  wild  animal  and  is 
not under the control of its creator. 

The thing continues to rot after its creation and so 

eventually decays into incapacity.

spell casting as invoking Mythos gods and the requirement 
of  the  caster  to  breathe  part  of  his  or  her  own  "life  force" 
into  the  corpse.  The  casting  time  is  not  important  and  is 
reduced to one day, but it could just as well remain at one 
week. This zombie will follow simple commands and may 
even slowly learn more over time. The zombie’s life is linked 
to the caster and it will become inactive and rot away should 
its master die.  

Let’s  call  this  spell  The  Graveyard  Kiss  to  evoke  what 

might be its kinder, albeit misplaced, intentions.

Graveyard Kiss 
(Create Zombie Variant)

Cost: 5 POW; 1D10 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 day 
The  spell  requires  a  human  corpse  that  retains  suffi-
cient flesh to allow mobility after activation. The caster 
puts an ounce of his or her own blood in the mouth 
of  the  corpse,  then  kisses  the  lips  of  the  corpse  and 
“breathes part of the self” into the body. Five points of 
POW are lost, a gift to the corpse. 

If the spell succeeds, the caster may give the zombie 
simple commands that it will carry out. Over time the 
zombie may learn to accept more complex commands. 
Should the caster die, the zombie becomes inactive and 
rots away. Part of the invocation refers collectively to the 
Mythos Gods—though no specific names are used. 

Deeper Version
It is rumored that some may be able to create and con-
trol unlimited undead servants, with some suggesting 
that a sorcerer’s POW sets the limit for the number of 
zombies that can be controlled. 

Divide the caster’s POW by five; the result is the 
maximum  number  of  zombies  that  may  be  actively 
controlled at any given time.

Call of CthulhuA Macabre Version of the Create Zombie Spell:

If you want an altogether more evil version of the spell—
one  that  involves  the  capture  and  murder  of  an  innocent 
person, perhaps a friend of an investigator or even an actual 
investigator—then something must be altered to allow the 
spell to begin with a living target.

First  the  target  would  have  to  be  captured,  and  one 
obvious way to capture and subdue a target is with poison. 
This spell is intended to have an evil feel, so the target is then 
buried alive for a few days. Later the victim is converted to 
a zombie to serve its master for so long as the caster lives or 
wishes.  This  is  an  evil  spell  involving  murder  and  torture, 
thus the Sanity cost is increased to 10 points. The fact that 
this spell does not so much animate a corpse as corrupt a 

Create Zombi 
(Create Zombie Variant)

Cost: 10 magic points; 10 Sanity points
Casting time: variable (days)
The  target  is  brought  to  near  death  by  a  paralyzing 
powder  made  from  blowfish  innards  and  alkaloids. 
This  poison  must  be  inhaled.  The  target  must  then 
succeed in an Extreme CON roll (equal to or under one-
fifth CON) to resist the poison. On a failure the target 
falls  into  a  deep  trance  indistinguishable  from  death. 
Horribly, the target is still conscious but incapable of 
movement.  The  victim  is  put  in  a  coffin  and  buried 
alive in the cemetery. A small tube connects the coffin 
to the surface so that he or she may breathe. During 
this time, the unfortunate target of the spell must pass 
a Sanity roll every three game hours or lose 1D6 SAN. 
If the target goes insane during this period, he or she 
embraces the will of the sorcerer, grateful that the terror 
of the grave has been dispelled.

Three nights later, the caster comes to the gravesite 
and casts Create Zombi. If the caster perceives mental 
resistance from the target, an opposed POW roll (see 
page 243) roll is made between the caster and target. 
Whether the target is sane or insane, success with the 
spell drains away all but 1 POW. If the spell fails, the 
caster  may  simply  cover  up  the  breathing  hole  and 
leave the victim to suffocate.

With a successful casting, the sorcerer has created 
a zombie servant, able to obey simple commands. The 
unfortunate  zombie  remains  under  the  spell  of  the 
sorcerer, until such a time as the zombie is released—
usually  meaning  the  true  death  of  the  victim  or  the 
death of its master.

living person is deemed justification to decrease the magic 
point cost from 16 to 10. The spell still takes a number of 
days  to  cast,  and  the  resulting  zombie  is  still  only  able  to 
follow basic commands.

Because this spell targets a living person there should be 
some way to oppose it. Two rolls may be used, first a CON 
roll to resist the poison and second a POW roll to resist the 
effects of the spell.  This variant might only have the subtly 
different name of Create Zombi.

Creating a New Spell
Call of Cthulhu is not a game that strives for game balance 
between  the  player  characters  and  their  enemies.  Nor  is 
there  a  level-based  structure  into  which  spells  must  fit.  If, 
for example, you create a spell that is similar to one in the 
Grimoire,  but  which  costs  less  for  greater  effect,  you  have 
not contravened any rules. You should be wary of introduc-
ing elements (such as spells) into your game that may have a 
major effect on game play. This is not to say that you should 
not do so, just that you should not do so thoughtlessly.

Look at the spells in this book and find one that approx-
imates the magnitude of effect of your new spell. This will 
provide a starting point as to the cost in magic points, POW 
and Sanity points.

Consider  how  easy  the  spell  will  be  to  cast.  A  caster 
might have 16 magic points and be able to burn some hit 
points to increase this number to, let’s say, 25. Beyond this, 
the caster will either require a reservoir of magic points or 
additional participants in the casting to donate magic points 
of their own. Some spells require POW to be spent. POW 
can be accrued by wizards through certain spells or items, 
such as an enchanted cane.

Sacrifices  and  other  morally  objectionable  rites  can  be 
added to spells for two purposes. First, to evoke the theme of 
horror. Second, to make the spells either difficult or a moral 
dilemma for the players. For example, will the players want 
to use a spell that can thwart the opposition if it requires a 
human sacrifice?

Call, Contact, and Summon Disambiguation
These  three  spell  types  have  much  in  common  and  it  is 
useful to understand the differences.

Call spells are immensely powerful rituals that bring an 
actual physical manifestation of a god before the caster. Call 
spells may be used by cults to bring forth their dark gods to 
accept ritual sacrifices or as an act of worship. The flip-side 
of the Call spell is the Dismiss spell, used to send the god 
back  from  whence  it  came.  Dismiss  spells  may  well  prove 
useful to the investigators.

Contact spells can be considered a request for commu-
nication—somewhat like an  esoteric telephone  call. When 
successfully used with Mythos monsters, it will draw one or 
more to the caster; however, they come of their own volition 
and  are  not  under  the  caster’s  control.  When  used  with  a 
deity or Great Old One, the spell opens communication but 
does  not  necessarily  bring  forth  a  physical  manifestation. 

245 

chapter 12: grimoireInvestigators might have cause to use a contact spell under 
certain  circumstances;  for  example,  to  contact  intelligent 
Mythos races to gain information or aid; however, to do so 
is perilous in the extreme.

Summon  spells  compel  a  monster  (not  a  god)  to  ap-
pear before the caster. Such monsters may be bound to the 
caster’s  will  to  do  his  or  her  bidding.  Thus  summon  (and 
bind) spells are used by wizards and cultists who wish use 
the power of some otherworldly horror. Investigators might 
use a summon spell, but they had best ensure they can bind 
what they summon!

The Grimoire
This section lists spells alphabetically with a couple of ex-
ceptions.  There  are  three  major  classes  of  spells:  Call  and 
Dismiss  Spells,  Contact  Spells,  and  Enchantment  Spells, 
which define and group the spells that follow.

Apportion Ka
Cost: 10 magic points, 5 POW and 2D10 Sanity points per 
organ
Casting time: 1 day per organ

A portion of the caster’s life essence, or "ka," is transferred 
into one of his or her vital organs. The enchanted organ is 
then removed from the caster’s body, to be hidden away for 
safekeeping and providing the wizard with a form of invul-
nerability—as  long  as  the  enchanted  organ  remains  safely 
hidden the wizard will not suffer particular attacks and may 
even be invulnerable to death.

This spell was first used by followers of the Dark Pha-
raoh,  Nephren-Ka,  who  would  remove  a  vital  organ,  such 
as the heart or liver, and lock them away in safe places. This 
would make the caster virtually impossible to kill, if not for 
the spell’s one weakness. The brain is the seat of the spell’s 
power and, as such, could not be removed. If the brain was 
destroyed, the other organs would lose their magical prop-
erties and the caster would die.

Having  one’s  own  insides  removed  costs  2D10  Sanity 
points and the permanent loss of 5 POW per organ removed. 
Attacks that impale cause only normal damage (unless the 
head  is  specifically  targeted).  Invulnerability  stems  from 
which  organ  is  removed;  for  example  if  the  lungs  are  re-
moved then the caster is unaffected by lack of oxygen (thus 
drowning and suffocation are no longer threats). Removal 
of vital organs may also render the caster immune to poison 
and so forth.

If the caster is harmed, hit points should be reduced as 
usual, leading to unconsciousness but not death. Death will 
only occur if the brain is specifically targeted and destroyed.

The Deathless Breath.

Banishment of Yde Etad
Cost: 1D4+3 magic points per caster; 1D4 Sanity points each
Casting time: variable (minimum 1 hour)

This  spell  sends  home  most  trans-dimensional  human  or 
human-like intelligences that are under their own volition. 
It  is  not  effective  against  any  creature  commanded  by  an-
other  intelligence.  Correctly  performed,  the  banishment 
is  permanent  and  irrevocable.  Each  banishment  is  of  an 
individual target, not of a type of monsters.

At  least  three  people  must  participate  in  the  spell.  All 
participants must know the spell. More participants add to 
the effectiveness; however, the total number of participants 
must be divisible by three.

This banishment works by destroying with ritual flames 
a sigil representing the target. The target’s personal sigil is 
best, but a substitute can be prepared according to a formula 
described within the spell. For the spell to take effect an op-
posed POW roll must be made between the caster with the 
highest POW and target. One bonus die is granted for each 
additional set of three casters.

The  spell  must  be  performed  in  the  open  air  in  the 
middle of the night, ideally in a place of power associated 
with the target. This could be known haunts, its last known 
location or its point of entry into this dimension. The spell 
casters must divide their numbers: one-third remain outside 
a protective circle and the rest stand within.

Bind spells, see Summoning Spells 
(page 263)

Bless Blade
Cost: 5 POW; 1D4 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 hour

Creates a blade capable of damaging or killing entities that 
cannot  be  harmed  by  mundane  weapons.  Requires  the 
blood sacrifice of an animal of at least SIZ 50. The blade of 
the knife must be of an elemental metal such as iron or sil-
ver. The blade may be of any size; however, larger blades do 
greater damage(see Table XVII: Weapons, pages 401-405).

If  the  blade  is  broken,  melted,  or  otherwise  damaged 
it  permanently  loses  this  ability;  however,  it  will  not  be 
harmed in attacks against supernatural entities.

Alternative names: Imbue Might of the Elder Ones, Ritu-

al of the Seven Cuts, Spirit’s Bane.

Body Warping of Gorgoroth
Cost: 6+ magic points; 5 POW; 2D6 Sanity points
Casting time: 1D6+4 minutes

Allows  the  caster  to  change  his  or  her  physical  form.  The 
sorcerer  can  change  to  any  shape  and  appearance,  though 
retaining  personal  abilities.  The  form  is  fleshly  but  it  can 

246 

Call of Cthulhuappear to be made of stone, wood, a rug, etc. Once changed 
into a new shape, the caster has the mobility of that shape. 
The caster’s STR, CON, INT, POW and DEX do not change. 
If  emulating  a  person,  the  sorcerer’s  Appearance  becomes 
that of the individual emulated. The caster can take on only 
a known form.

The caster invokes Nyarlathotep and repeats the phrases 
of  the  spell  while  expending  6  magic  points  and  an  addi-
tional magic point for each 5 points of SIZ to be gained or 
lost in the body warping. Only one alteration per casting is 
possible and the effect is permanent until the spell is recast 
to change back again. This spell cannot be cast on another 
being.

Alternative names:  Mastery  of  the  Flesh,  Skin Walking, 

The Black Pharaoh’s Touch.

Deeper Version
If imitating an individual, the caster becomes a replica 
of  that  person,  including  voice  and  speech  patterns. 
The caster does not need to repeat the spell to undo the 
warping—a simple verbal phrase is all that is required.

Brew Space-Mead
A wonderfully golden liquid, which he kept in a carafe in his 
desk and served in tiny Belgian liqueur glasses in such small 
amounts that it seemed futile even to raise it to one’s lips—
and yet its bouquet and its taste…outdid even the oldest 
Chianti and the best Chateau Yquem to such an extent that 
to mention them in the same breath was to do injustice to the 
professor’s brew. Fiery though it was, it had the additional 
effect of making me drowsy…
—August Derleth, The House on Curwen Street

Cost:  20  magic  points  per  dose;  plus  variable  additional 
Magic and Sanity points
Casting time: Many days

This  spell  creates  a  magical  drink  that  allows  a  human  to 
withstand journeys through the vacuum and vicissitudes of 
space. For all such journeys, the effectiveness of space-mead 
also requires the expenditure of an equal number of magic 
points  and  Sanity  points,  commensurate  to  the  journey’s 
distance in light years by the traveller taking the drug (see 
Table XII: Space Mead Effectiveness).

Brewing the drink and taking the journey represent sepa-
rate stages for the caster/user. Different types of space-mead 
exist,  each  with  the  same  effects  but  all  of  them  requiring 
different ingredients.

Brewing  space-mead  requires  five  special  ingredients 
to be chosen by the Keeper and requires at least a week of 
brewing time. Once the mead is foaming and bubbling, the 
caster must sacrifice 20 magic points per dose into the brew. 

Breath of the Deep
Cost: 8 magic points; 1D6 Sanity 
points
Casting time: 1 round

The  target’s  lungs  fill  with  sea-
water,  potentially  causing  an 
unpleasant death by drowning. 

The caster must be able to see 
the target. After mentally intoning 
the spell for a round, for the spell 
to take effect the caster must win 
an  opposed  POW  roll  with  the 
target. If the caster wins the target 
begins  to  drown—the  target  falls 
to  the  floor,  choking  on  seawater 
and  taking  1D8  damage  each 
round.  The  target  should  make 
an Extreme CON roll (equal to or 
below one-fifth CON) after taking 
damage  each  round;  if  the  roll  is 
successful  the  water  has  been  ex-
pelled and the effects of the spell 
cease.

chapter 12: grimoireThese magic points may be sacrificed over many days; the more 
points, the more doses. Each dose allows one person to with-
stand one journey through space of varying distance and time. 
Once  the  space-mead  has  been  enchanted,  the  traveler 
must  find  a  means  of  transportation—usually  a  mount: 
among  others,  the  spell  Summon  Byakhee  can  provide  an 
interstellar steed. The traveler then drinks a dose (presum-
ably  bringing  a  return  dose  along),  climbs  on,  commands 
the mount, and  the journey begins. It is at this point that 
the traveler pays the necessary magic and Sanity point cost 
subject for the distance being traveled.

While in space, the travelers are in mental and physical 
stasis, nearly insensible to their surroundings. Upon arrival 
at the destination, the effects of the brew conclude.

Call and Dismiss Deity 
Spells

Call Deity
Cost: 1+ magic points per person; 1D10 Sanity points (cast-
er only)
Casting time: 1-100 minutes

Call spells bring the avatar, god, or Great Old One before the 
caster. Casting this type of spell is perilous indeed, even for 
cultists. Only cult priests or desperate people should choose 
to call a Mythos deity. A handful are cited here. Both Call 
and Dismiss spells are likely to exist for every Great Old One 
and for every form of Mythos god.

A group can assist by adding power to Call spells, with 
the caster acting as the focus for the group. Everyone pres-
ent expends 1 magic point. Those who know the spell can 
sacrifice any number of magic points (including burning hit 
points). The total of the magic points spent is the percentage 
chance that the spell works. For each magic point spent, the 
group must chant for a minute, but never for more than 100 
minutes. On a roll of 100 the spell will always fail with all 
magic points sacrificed in the spell lost.

The  caster  also  loses  1D10  Sanity  points  in  casting 
the  spell.  Everyone  present  loses  Sanity  points  if  the  deity 
appears. The Keeper plays the thing and must create some 
motivation for the thing’s behavior. Mostly, when a Mythos 
deity arrives on Earth, it wants to stay and is usually hungry.

Call Deity Spell Requirements

As mentioned, each deity requires certain conditions to be in 
place for the Call spell to work. Keepers should use these as 
inspiration but not be constrained by them for two reasons. 
The  first  reason  is  fiction-based;  no  human  fully  under-
stands the Cthulhu Mythos, so there may be more than one 
way to Call a Deity. The second reason is that experienced 
players will quickly latch onto the familiar elements and the 
mystery will be blown.

Call Azathoth: Calling this god is extremely dangerous and 
has the potential to fry the entire planet. The spell can be 
cast only outside at night; however, no other special prepa-
rations are needed.

Alternative names:  Petition  of  Chaos, The  Unspeakable 

Vowel of The Shaggai.

Call Cthugha: Cthugha bursts into being through a flame 
held by the caster (a candle, torch, etc.) As the caster intones 
the  spell,  he  or  she  moves  the  flame  in  series  of  patterns. 
The spell can be successfully cast only on clear nights when 
Fomalhaut  (the  brightest  star  in  the  Piscis Austrinus  con-
stellation)  clears  the  horizon.  September  to  November  are 
the best nights for Fomalhaut in the Northern Hemisphere.
Alternative names: Evocation of the Fiery Burning Doom, 

The Formalhaut Convention.

Call Hastur: Calls the deity to nine large blocks of stone ar-
ranged in a V-pattern (always a sign of cult activity!) Each of 
the stone blocks needs a volume of nine or more cubic yards.
The spell can be cast only on clear nights when Aldebaran 
(in the constellation of Taurus) is above the horizon (roughly 
October to March). Each byakhee present during Call Hastur 
adds a further 10 percentiles to the chance for success.

If 5 points of POW have been sacrificed into each of the 
stone blocks, so that all are enchanted, the stone V adds 30 
percentiles to the chance to cast Summon/Bind Byakhee.

Alternative names: The Yellow Petition.

Call  Ithaqua:  Focuses  the  attention  of  Ithaqua;  however, 
the presence of the Great Old One may be noticed only as a 
whirlwind or strong icy wind. The spell must be cast on an 
enormous mound of snow (minimum 10 feet high). Legend 
states that the spell may only be performed in the far north

Call Nyogtha:  Invokes  the  favor  of  Nyogtha,  who  appears 
to grant a boon to the caster—if Nyogtha deems the cast-
er  worthy.  The  caster  must  perform  the  spell  ritual  at  the 
entrance  to  any  cavern  (certain  tomes  hint  that  all  great 
caverns link to the one wherein Nyogtha dwells).

Call  Shub-Niggurath:  Calls  Shub-Niggurath  to  a  conse-
crated  stone  altar.  This  altar  must  be  positioned  in  dank 
wilderness  under  the  sky.  The  spell  must  be  cast  from  the 
altar at the dark of the moon.

Each  Call  of  the  dark  goddess  requires  fresh  blood  to 
consecrate  the  altar.  An  altar  bathed  in  the  blood  of  the 
equivalent  of  200  SIZ  or  more  adds  20  percentiles  to  the 
chance  to  Call  Shub-Niggurath,  while  each  dark  young 
present adds further 10 percentiles.

Call Yog-Sothoth: Calls Yog-Sothoth to a specially construct-
ed stone tower. The tower must be in an open area and the sky 

248 

Call of Cthulhumust be cloudless. The stone tower must be at least ten yards 
high. Each time the spell is cast, the cultists must designate a 
human sacrifice for the god’s taking. This need be no more 
than  an  invitation—gesturing  toward  a  nearby  village,  for 
instance, from which Yog-Sothoth then selects a victim.

At the cult’s option, the stone tower may be enchanted, 
lowering the magic points needed for a successful cast of the 
spell. Each point of POW infused in the tower permanently 
improves the total chance of casting Call Yog-Sothoth from 
it by 1 percentile.

Dismiss Deity
Cost: 1 or more magic points per person.
Casting time: 1 minute plus 1 extra round per participant 
who donates magic points

A deity who does not want to leave Earth may be dismissed. 
Every Dismiss spell differs; the caster must know the specific 
Dismiss  spell  for  the  particular  deity.  First,  allot  1  magic 
point  per  25  POW  (round  down)  possessed  by  the  deity. 
This grants an initial 5% chance to dismiss the god and it 
opens the way for the deity’s dismissal. 

Cthugha has 210 POW and so 8 magic points are need-
ed to ‘open the way’ to dismiss this terrible monstrosity.

Once  the  way  is  prepared,  the  sacrifice  of  more  magic 
points can tempt the deity into departure. In this, the second 
stage, each new magic point sacrificed increases the chance 
that  the  deity  leaves  by  5  percentiles.  Sacrificing  10  more 
magic points adds 50 percentiles to the chance. As with the 
Call Deity version of the spell, a group of people can assist 
one another to cast Dismiss Deity.

8 magic points opens the way for Cthugha, represent-
ing  a  5%  chance  for  dismissal.  Sacrificing  10  more 
magic points increases the chance to 55%. To have a 
99% (the maximum achievable) chance of dismissing 
Cthugha, those assembled must sacrifice 8+19 magic 
points in the two stages, a total of 27 magic points.

Roll  1D100  against  the  total  chance  for  the  dismissal. 
As with Call Deity, the caster is the focus of the spell; other 
members of the group can contribute magic points. Dismiss 
Deity costs no Sanity points.

Call  Deity  spells  always  require  special  conditions  and 
rituals; however, the Dismiss portion of the spell can be cast 
anytime, anywhere. 

Dismiss Deity 
Spell Names 

When  composing  alternative  names  for  Dismiss 
Deity spells, consider the following words for inspi-
ration:

Banishment 
Dispel 
Exile 

Repel 
Bane 
Evict

Repudiate
Cast Out

Also,  try  to  use  evocative  and  subtle  names  for 
the actual Mythos deities rather than simply using 
their common names. There’s no reason why a spell 
name  concerning  Yog-Sothoth  couldn’t  reference 
the  being  as  The  Hideous  Spheres,  or  The  Un-
quenchable Thirster of Souls, and so forth. Keeping 
the players guessing about what a spell will do or to 
whom it’s connected can help to stimulate mystery 
and fear of the unknown

Cause/Cure Blindness
Cost:  8  magic  points  (and  2D6  Sanity  points  for  Cause 
Blindness)
Casting time: 1 day

The target suffers complete and permanent blindness, as if 
by a stroke. The same spell can reverse blindness if the eyes 
and optic nerves are essentially intact. The spell costs 8 mag-
ic points for either version. A day of ritual is required. For 
the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed 
POW roll with the target (automatic success if the target is 
consenting).

Alternative names: Grant Sight, Shade of Darkness, The 

Pharaoh’s Curse.

Chant of Thoth 
Cost: 10 magic points; 1D4 Sanity points.
Casting time: 30 minutes

The use of this spell increases the caster’s mental faculties, 
boosting his or her chance of solving a particular intellectual 
problem. Spending 10 magic points in the chant grants the 
caster a bonus die on his or her dice roll to gain knowledge, 
learn a spell, translate a passage, deduce the meaning of a 
symbol, etc. 

Alternative names: The Rite of Cerebral Acuity, The Song 

of Erudite Addition, The Scholars Chorus.

Harvey is trying to translate a Latin scroll. He casts Chant 
of  Thoth,  spending  10  magic  points.  He  has  a  Latin  skill 
of 66. He rolls 84 and 34 (bonus die); a success. The chant 
has expanded his mental capacities for a short time, during 
which he fully comprehends the Latin language.

Cloud Memory
Cost: 1D6 magic points; 1D2 Sanity points
Casting time: Instantaneous

The spell blocks the target’s ability to consciously remember 
a particular event. The caster must be able to see the target 
and the target must be able to receive the caster’s instruc-
tions.  The  spell  takes  effect  immediately  if  the  caster  suc-
ceeds in an opposed POW roll with the target. If the caster 
wins,  the  target’s  mind  is  mentally  blocked  regarding  one 
specified incident. If the incident was terrifying, the victim 
may  thereafter  still  have  nightmares  vaguely  relating  to  it. 
If the spell fails, the event in question becomes vivid in the 
target’s mind.

The caster must know the specific event to be blocked. 
The  caster  cannot  command  something  vague  such  as, 
“Forget  what  you  did  yesterday.”  Instead,  he  or  she  must 
cite a certain event, such as, “Forget you were assaulted by a 
monster.” This spell cannot block knowledge of spells or of 
the Cthulhu Mythos unless the knowledge is firmly tied to a 
specific event, nor can it undo a Sanity loss or undo insanity.
Alternative names: Befuddle, Dumbfound, Mystify.

Clutch of Nyogtha
Cost: 1+ magic points equal to twice the damage delivered 
that round; 1D20 Sanity points
Casting time: Instantaneous

The caster must spend 1 magic point to begin the spell and the 
target must be within conversational distance. For the spell to 
take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll 
with the target. If the caster wins the roll, the target feels as 
though a large hand or tentacle is crushing his or her heart, 
losing 1D3 hit points for each combat round that the spell is 
in effect. While under such attack, the target is temporarily 
paralyzed, as though having a heart attack. In the round that 
the accumulated damage from this spell reduces hit points to 
zero,  the  target’s  chest  ruptures  and  bursts,  and  the  target’s 
smoking heart appears in the hand of the caster.

Each round the spell lasts, the caster must spend magic 
points equal to twice the number of hit points in damage. 
The caster must concentrate on the spell each round that it 
is to remain in effect and the caster must defeat the target in 
an opposed POW roll each round. If the caster is distracted 
or if the target successfully resists, the spell ends. Any dam-
age already done remains.

Consume Likeness
Cost:  10  magic  points  every  6  hours  of  casting;  5  POW; 
1D20 Sanity points
Casting time: several days

The caster can assume the living likeness of a person freshly 
dead,  as  seen  by  eye,  video  camera,  X-ray,  etc.  The  victim 
may be no more than 15 SIZ points different from the caster. 

For  the  next  few  days  the  caster  consumes  the  victim  and 
works the spell, expending 10 magic points every six hours 
and permanently sacrificing 5 POW points. The caster could 
consume several likenesses and thereby take on several guis-
es. When a victim is consumed, the caster loses 1D20 Sanity 
points. This spell is known by many serpent people.

Once  the  spell  is  complete,  the  caster  takes  on  the  ap-
pearance of the victim at will, for as long as desired. To the 
keen observer, the shadow of the caster remains as his or her 
original (not that of the consumed). Similarly, the caster’s 
skills and memories remain intact—the victim’s are gone.

Upon  losing  one  or  more  hit  points,  the  caster’s  orig-
inal form is resumed. To go from an assumed form to the 
original form takes 20 seconds. The original form must be 
reverted to before another form can be assumed. To go from 
the original to an assumed form takes 1D3 minutes.

Alternative names: The Snake Skin Cloak, The Valusian 

Mantle, The Gift of Yig.

Deeper Version
Casters are sometimes able to recollect memories and 
thoughts of those who have been consumed. This is 
usually a specific piece of information that was known 
to  the  unfortunate  target  of  the  spell.  An  additional 
magic point must be spent together with a roll under 
the caster’s POW for each additional piece of informa-
tion sought.

Contact Spells
Cost: Refer to specific spell
Sanity cost: 1D3 (plus more to view the monster)
Casting time: 1D6 + 4 rounds 

Contact spells are divided into two separate groups: spells 
concerned with contacting Mythos creatures and monsters, 
and spells for contacting Mythos deities (see Contact Deity). 
Using  Contact  spells  a  cultist  could  get  in  touch  with 
monsters  and  alien  races,  perhaps  to  learn  about  magic, 
gods, or alien species. The caster should have a definite goal 
in mind; bargains might be struck and plans negotiated. 

Contact  spells  do  not  give  the  caster  the  upper  hand 
though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. 
Remember  these  are  independent  and  intelligent  beings 
with their own motivations—casters make contact at their 
peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells (see 
page 263) that have the potential to allow casters to bind the 
summoned beings to their will. 

250 

Call of CthulhuProcedures  are  much  the  same  for  each  Contact  spell, 
though  particular  conditions  or  requirements  may  be 
unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting 
another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.

Cast properly this spell always works, unless there are no 
such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps 
might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Aus-
tralia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).

A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing 
reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a 
game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in 
hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig, 
or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called 
by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions 
can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.

The spell brings a random member of the species, pre-
sumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be 
alone, or to be with no more than a small group, in order 
not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, 
it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, 
the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve.

If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only 
one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper 
may determine if several representatives arrive as a group.

There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather 
bargain with, or devour, the caster. It will have an alien moti-
vation; however, if further contact seems of advantage to both 
sides, then some interesting roleplaying may emerge.

As mentioned, each version of the spell requires certain 

conditions to be in place for it to work.

Contact Chthonian: Unless there are no chthonians nearby, 
it succeeds automatically. The spell must be cast at a loca-
tion that has known recent earthquakes or where hot spots 
and volcanoes offer relatively quick transport from the deep 
interior of the planet to the outer edge of the geologic crust.

Cost: 5 magic points

Contact Deep One: Unless there are no deep ones nearby, 
the  chanting  succeeds  automatically.  This  spell  should  be 
cast  at  the  edge  of  a  saltwater  ocean  or  sea.  To  work  best, 
it  should  be  cast  near  a  deep  one  city,  such  as  the  waters 
off Innsmouth, Massachusetts or the coast near the town of 
Dunwich,  England.  Part  of  the  ritual  consists  of  throwing 
specially inscribed stones into the water.

Cost: 3 magic points

Contact  Elder  Thing:  Unless  there  are  no  elder  things 
nearby, the chanting succeeds automatically. The most likely 
locations  are  along  the  southern  part  of  the  Mid-Atlantic 
Ridge or over the geological trenches nearest Antarctica.

Cost: 3 magic points

Contact Flying Polyp: Unless there are no flying polyps nearby, 
it succeeds automatically. Flying polyps occur only in their rare 
underground cities, the largest of which is beneath the City in 
the Sands, in the western Australian desert. The caster should 
first construct or open a communication shaft for their egress.

Cost: 9 magic points

Contact  Formless  Spawn:  Unless  there  are  no  formless 
spawn  nearby,  it  succeeds  automatically.  The  best  place  to 
cast this spell is at a temple of Tsathoggua, whose altar statue 
of Tsathoggua is still present or at a spot near an opening 
into  the  black  abyss  of  N’Kai,  somewhere  near  Binger, 
Oklahoma. Possibly other places in Western or Midwestern 
North America offer entry and exit points. One such cavern 
reputedly exists near Dunwich, Massachusetts.

Cost: 3 magic points

Contact  Ghoul:  Unless  there  are  no  ghouls  nearby,  it 
succeeds  automatically.  Ghouls  are  found  wherever  large 
concentrations  of  humans  are,  especially  near  graveyards 
and  crypts.  Places  of  burial  more  than  a  century  old  are 
propitious locations for this spell. Moonlit nights are best.

Cost: 5 magic points

Contact Gnoph-Keh: Unless there are no gnoph-keh near-
by, it succeeds automatically. Gnoph-keh are usually found 
in Greenland or other frozen wastes near the North Pole. 

The spell must be augmented with a successful Sing (Art 
& Craft specialism) roll and before doing so the caster must 
build a small effigy of the beast from ice and snow.
Cost: 6 magic points

Contact Hound of Tindalos: If a hound of Tindalos is sum-
moned it will come automatically. There is no known way to 
bargain with a hound of Tindalos, whose motive for moving 
through the stream of time and space is pure hunger.

Cost: 7 magic points

Contact Mi-Go:  Unless  there  are  no  mi-go  nearby,  it  suc-
ceeds  automatically.  The  spell  must  be  cast  at  the  base  or 
the top of a high mountain—in a range known to be mined 
or  visited  by  the  enigmatic  spacefaring  race.  Among  such 
ranges are the Appalachians, Andes and the Himalayas, and 
some peaks in Central Africa.

Cost: 8 magic points

Contact Rat-Thing: To bring forth a foul rat-thing, it must 
be  cast  at  or  near  a  site  infested  by  rat-things.  A  popula-
tion  of  these  evil  creatures  reportedly  exists  in  Yorkshire, 
England.  Another  report  of  similar  creatures  comes  from 
Massachusetts.

Cost: 2 magic points

Contact  Sand-Dweller:  Unless  there  are  no  sand-dwellers 
nearby, it succeeds automatically. The spell must be cast in 
a  suitable  desert,  such  as  in  the  Sahara,  the  southwestern 
United States, Saudi Arabia, or central Australia.

Cost: 3 magic points

Contact Servitor of the Outer Gods: A successful Luck roll 
establishes  that  a  servitor  is  within  the  Milky  Way  galaxy 
when the spell is cast. If no servitor is within that range, the 
magic points are lost. 

Stars must be visible to the caster. He or she attempts to 
visualize Azathoth’s Ineffable Heart (reputedly a spheroidal 
symbol of meditation but actually of unknown shape) that 
pulses and shines like liquid flame. The servitor manifests 

251 

chapter 12: grimoirewithin 1D6+4 rounds and expects a blood sacrifice. If the 
nominated sacrifice is inadequate, the servitor devours the 
caster. If the servitor accepts the sacrifice, it agrees to per-
form one simple task for the caster.

With a successful Persuade roll, the servitor also deigns 
to answer one respectful question about Mighty Azathoth, 
the court at the center of the universe, or an Outer God. The 
answer adds 1D3 Cthulhu Mythos to the questioner’s total, 
but the answer is meaningless to onlookers.

With a roll equal to or less than a fifth of the caster’s Per-
suade skill, the servitor also imparts a spell directly into the 
caster’s brain, costing the caster 1D8 Sanity points and 1D10 
rounds of disorientation. The servitor chooses the spell.

Its services rendered, the servitor may linger and play its 
unearthly pipes while colors flash across its body and its ten-
tacles writhe, or it may dissolve and return to some galactic 
arm or stellar nursery and resume its previous activity.

Hearing  its  insane  and  mesmerizing  pipes  costs  1/1D4 
Sanity points and thereafter haunts every singer or instru-
mentalist  who  was  present.  They  become  indifferent  to 
earthly scales and more and more feel compelled to perform 
in the cosmic scales revealed to them.

Cost: 14 magic points

Contact Spirits of the Dead: Many versions of this spell ex-
ist. One version requires a tent of white sheets to be erected 
near a river, and jugs full of the stream’s water are placed in-
side. Songs are sung and dances danced. An entreaty is made 
for the dead to appear. Add up all the magic points, multiply 
the sum by five, with the caster needing to roll equal to or 
under that result on 1D100. With a success, the voices of the 
dead emerge from the water jugs. One may hear them and 
discuss or question them by putting one’s head in the tent. 
Remember that the dead mostly know only what they knew 
in life and that some do not realize that they are dead.

Cost: 3 or more magic points

Contact Star-Spawn of Cthulhu: Unless there are no repre-
sentatives nearby, it succeeds automatically. It should be cast 
at the ocean shore, perhaps near a deep one outpost or else 
near a spot where star-spawn may sleep. The spell works well 
in Polynesia, along the Massachusetts coast, and above R’lyeh.

Cost: 6 magic points

Contact Yithian: This spell does not reach forward or back-
ward  in  time.  If  a Yithian  mind  occupies  a  subject  within 
one hundred miles of the caster at the time the spell is cast, 
the Yithian notices the appeal and may respond if curious, 
fearful,  or  alarmed.  If  the  caster  has  nothing  interesting 
to  say  or  offer,  then  the  Great  Race  scholar  ignores  later 
questions, or perhaps destroys the caster as a likely pest or 
nuisance.

Cost: 4 magic points

Alternative names: For Contact spells, use words like: Union, 
Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. 
For example, The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth. 

Contact Deity Spells
Cost: 5 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: five to ten (1D6 + 4) rounds

Contact Deity spells are unused except by the insane priests 
of these deities, or by great independent sorcerers who hope 
to strike deals and win over some small fraction of the dei-
ty’s powers. The deity sought for Contact can be any one of 
the Gods or Great Old Ones.

For each such spell, the caster must sacrifice 5 POW. The 
chance of successfully contacting the deity is equal to half 
the caster’s (reduced) POW. If the roll succeeds, the deity or 
some aspect of it will contact the caster in a semi-friendly 
manner after a few game hours or days. The deity is unlikely 
to  give  non-worshipers  anything  of  value.  If  the  deity  is 
bored or offended the god will likely squash the caster, or 
drive him or her insane, and so get some inhuman pleasure 
from the situation.

Each version of the spell tends to reflect the deity concerned.

Contact  Deity:  Chaugnar  Faugn:  Opens  communication 
with  Chaugnar  Faugn. With  a  success,  the  deity  sends  the 
caster visions or nightmares that inform the dreamer of the 
god’s desires, or lets him or her know if a petition to the god 
is to be favorably answered or rejected.

Contact  Deity:  Cthulhu:  Opens  communication  with 
Cthulhu.  Cthulhu  typically  responds  at  night,  during  the 
caster’s dreams. By dreams and nightmares he informs his 
followers of his desires.

Contact  Deity:  Eihort:  Resembles  other  Contact  Deity 
spells,  but  the  caster  sacrifices  1  magic  point  in  casting  it. 
The god automatically appears in dream form if the caster 
is distant and in person if within a few hundred yards. In 
imparting this spell into the caster’s brain, Eihort extracts 5 
POW in compensation.

Contact  Deity:  Nodens:  Opens  communication  with 
Nodens. The Contact spell for Nodens can be cast only from 
a remote, unpeopled place such as the edge of a sea-cliff. If, 
later, Nodens contacts the caster, it will be when he or she is 
alone and in a similar inaccessible place.

Contact Deity: Nyarlathotep: Opens communication with 
Nyarlathotep. This spell can be cast from anywhere, as befits 
this omnipresent god; however, Nyarlathotep appears only 
at meetings of worshipers or when new priests of the Gods 
are anointed.

Contact  Deity:  Tsathoggua:  Opens  communication  with 
Tsathoggua. Tsathoggua may appear in spirit form as a hazy 
and translucent projection of his real self, to which normal 
Sanity  losses  apply.  He  usually  visits  only  if  the  caster  is 
alone. He speaks audibly to the caster.

Contact  Deity:  Y’golonac:  Opens  communication  with 
Y’golonac. This god responds by attempting to convert the 
caster to its worship. If the deity feels that the caster would 
be an unsuitable priest, it will psychically attack him or her 
and try to eat the soul and mind. If the caster might be suit-

252 

Call of Cthulhuable, Y’golonac  tries  to  possess  a  friend,  who  (controlled) 
approaches the caster to tempt him or her into service.

Create Zombie

Cost: 16 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points

Casting time: a week

A  ritual  liquid  must  be  poured  over  a  corpse  or  into  the 
grave where a corpse lies. The Keeper determines the ingre-
dients of the liquid—at least one part should be difficult to 
obtain legally. 

The corpse is left to mature. At the end of a week, the 
caster comes to the grave and intones the binding ritual. At 
the end of the half-hour chant, the corpse claws its way from 
the grave and thereafter performs the caster’s will. The zom-
bie will perform mundane and simple tasks, such as “guard 
this,” “fetch that,” or “kill him!”

A zombie created in this manner continues to rot after it 
has risen. Thus, a wizard wishing a constant zombie servant 
must periodically create replacements.

Statistics for zombies can be found in Chapter 16: Mon-

sters, Beasts and Alien Gods.

For a number of variations on this spell see Spell Varia-

tions (see page 242).

Alternative names: Ritual of the Undying, Black Binding, 

The Ashen Cowl, Raising of the Dead.

Curse of the Putrid Husk

Cost: 5 magic points; 10 Sanity points

Casting time: 1 hour

This spell brings sanity-wracking illusions to the victim. The 
victim  perceives  that  his  or  her  skin  is  visibly  rotting  and 
corrupting.  The  outward  appearance  seems  to  deteriorate 
swiftly,  so  that  great  rents  and  tears  occur  through  which 
internal organs begin to tumble out (with the victim losing 
1D10  Sanity  points  in  the  process).  Thereupon  the  victim 
faints and awakens in a few minutes, whole and normal. 

For the spell to take effect an opposed INT roll must be 
made  between  the  caster  and  target—impose  one  penalty 
die on the target if the spell is cast at night, while the target 
is  sleeping.  The  entire  cycle  of  effect  takes  about  twenty 
minutes, including the faint.

The target must be known to the caster and the caster 
must have as a focus some personal object belonging to the 
target. The experience of the spell is devastating; however, 
successful Psychoanalysis can help the victim come to terms 
with  these  inexplicable  dreams  and  hallucinations  and  re-
store half of each such Sanity loss. Psychiatric drugs do little 
to compensate for such an attack.

Create Barrier of Naach-Tith
Cost: variable magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 minute

The  barrier  provides  both  a  physical  and  magical  defense. 
Each participant in this spell loses 1D10 Sanity points and a 
variable number of magic points. Each magic point expended 
in the creation provides the barrier 3D10 points of STR. The 
spell  takes  1  minute  to  cast  (during  which  time  all  magic 
points to be used must be expended) and the resulting barrier 
lasts 1D4+4 hours. Anyone who knows the spell may partici-
pate in the casting and contribute magic points to the barrier.
The barrier is spherical in shape and about 100 yards in 
diameter. It can be cast around the casters to protect from 
harm or it can be cast to encompass a monster or enemy. 
Any  creature  bisected  by  the  barrier’s  boundary  upon  its 
creation  is unharmed and thrust outside the barrier. Any-
thing trapped should be allowed a STR roll opposed by the 
STR of the barrier. Multiple entrapped victims cannot com-
bine their STR to escape. A bullet or missile can cross the 
barrier if the rolled damage (ignore impales) to the barrier 
is greater than a fifth of the barrier’s STR. If penetrating the 
barrier, the object does the damage rolled, as if the barrier 
did not exist, and the barrier is destroyed.

A  written  copy  of  this  spell  is  known  to  be  in  a  great 
haunted library on a planet orbiting the star Celaeno, one 
of the Pleiades.

Alternative names: Great Ward of Naach-Tith, The Un-

seen Sphere that Entraps the Demon.

Deeper Version
Those  harnessing  the  knowledge  and  power  of  the 
Mythos are able to increase the size of the barrier to 
200 yards in diameter.

Create Mist of R’lyeh
Cost: 2 magic points 
Casting time: Instantaneous

The  spell  causes  a  dense  mist  to  appear  in  an  egg-shaped 
volume (10 × 10 × 15 feet), directly in front of the caster. 
The  long  axis  of  the  cloud  is  always  at  right  angles  to  the 
direction in which the caster faces. The spell obscures vision 
for 1D6+4 game rounds and then evaporates without trace.
Alternative names: Ye Terrible Cloud, Breath of the Dark 

Sea, The Dank Fog of Sailors Lost.

chapter 12: grimoireThe spell can affect only one individual at a time and has 
a maximum range of 10 yards. Obviously the command or 
commands  must  be  intelligible  to  the  target  and  the  spell 
may be broken if a command contradicts the target’s basic 
nature (such as instructing a human to fly).

Dominate  can  be  cast  and  recast  as  many  times  as  the 
caster finds possible, allowing a target to be controlled with-
out interruption for several minutes. Each cast of the spell 
has the same costs and limits. Recasting is instantaneous.

Alternative names: Command of the Wizard, The Chant 

of Possession, Baleful Influence.

Dread Curse of Azathoth
Cost: 4 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 round

The sorcerer draws upon the energies of the Outer God to 
directly drain POW from a victim. By repeating the secret 
name of Azathoth, one can generate respect and fear in any 
being  conversant  with  the  Mythos,  for  to  know  the  name 
implies that one knows the secret Last Syllable. Said alone, 
the Last Syllable may be directed against a foe. For the spell 
to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW 
roll with the target. If the caster is successful, the target loses 
3D6 POW.

Alternative  names:  Utterance  of  the  Last  Syllable,  Ye 

Doleful Leeching, By the True Name Thy Power is Sapped. 

Dust of Suleiman
Cost: 10 magic points per 3 doses.
Casting time: 1 round to apply 1 dose

Creates  a  grey-green  powder  that  harms  unnatural  beings 
from  other  planes  of  existence.  The  powder  requires  the 
dust from an Egyptian mummy at least 2,000 years old; each 
such mummy suffices for three doses of the magic dust. The 
ingredients also include frankincense, sulfur, and saltpeter. 
An incantation must be said over the dust while it is being 
sprinkled. 

Sprinkled over a being not of this Earth, the entity loses 
1D20  hit  points  per  dose.  It  takes  one  round  to  apply  a 
dose. The powder works only on extraterrestrial and other 
planar beings, thus the powder would harm a dimensional 
shambler, Yog-Sothoth  or  a  mi-go,  but  is  useless  against  a 
shoggoth or a deep one.

Alternative  names:  The  Egyptian  Powder,  Protection  of 

the Dead.

Death Spell
Cost: 24 magic points; 3D10 Sanity points
Casting time: 1D3 rounds

Reserved for only the most foul of sorcerers, this spell causes 
the bewildered victim to burst into flame. The target must be 
within ten yards of the caster. For the spell to take effect the 
caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target 
during  each  round  of  concentration. After  1D3  rounds  of 
concentration, the victim’s skin forms large blisters and he 
or  she  loses  1D3  hit  points.  In  the  next  round,  the  victim 
loses an additional 1D6 hit points. On the third round, the 
victim bursts into flames, losing 1D10 hit points then and 
each round thereafter. The stench of burning hair and flesh 
is  overwhelming  (all  witnesses  should  make  SAN  rolls  or 
lose  1/1D6  SAN).  It  is  impossible  to  render  aid,  since  the 
horrified victim burns from the inside out.

Alternative  names:  Ye  Dreadful  Pricking,  The  Curse  of 

Fiery Doom, Cthugha’s Embrace.

Deeper Version
Rather  than  cause  the  victim  to  suffer  the  effects  of 
this  spell  in  near  instantaneous  fashion,  the  caster 
may elect to prolong the spell over a course of days 
to enhance the victim’s suffering. The caster spends 
34  magic  points  in  casting  this  version  of  the  spell. 
The  caster  does  not  need  to  be  physically  near  the 
victim—instead the caster must possess a piece of the 
victim (hair, nail clipping, or skin, etc.), allowing the 
spell to be cast from any distance. The spell begins on 
the following day of casting and lasts for 7 days. For 
the spell to take effect, an opposed POW roll must be 
made between the caster and the target each day. On 
the first day, the victim suffers a 2 hit point wound, 
then a 4 hit point wound on the second day. There-
after,  the  wound  size  increases  by  2  hit  points  each 
day (6, 8, 10, 12, 14). An equal amount of Sanity is 
lost each day as the target begins to realize his or her 
terrible fate. On the day that hit points are reduced to 
zero, the victim’s body is consumed in a ball of flame.

Dominate
Cost: 1 magic point; 1 Sanity point
Casting time: Instantaneous 

Bends the will of the target to that of the caster. For the spell 
to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW 
roll with the target. If successful, the target obeys the com-
mands of the caster without exception until the next combat 
round concludes.

Call of CthulhuElder Sign
Cost: 10 POW
Casting time: 1 hour

Enchant Book
Cost: variable POW; 1D4 Sanity points
Casting time: 3 days

Its decoration…was, rather, in the rough shape of a star, in the 
center of which there appeared to be a caricature of a single 
giant  eye;  but  it  was  not  an  eye,  rather  a  broken  lozenge  in 
shape with certain lines suggestive of flames or perhaps a soli-
tary pillar of flame.

—August Derleth and H.P. Lovecraft,  

      The Lurker at the Threshold.

Aids in summoning star vampires by enchanting any book 
in  which  is  inscribed  the  words  of  the  spell  Summon/
Bind Star Vampire. The book’s ink must contain the ichor 
of  a  star  vampire.  The  caster  sacrifices  a  varying  amount 
of  POW,  loses  1D4  Sanity  points,  and  meditates  for  three 
days. For each point of POW channeled to the book, add 2 
percentiles to the caster’s chance of success with Summon/
Bind Star Vampire.

The  spell  activates  an  Elder  Sign.  Each  active  Elder  Sign 
takes  a  sacrifice  of  10  POW  to  create,  but  costs  no  Sanity 
points.  An  Elder  Sign  may  be  formed  into  a  leaden  seal, 
carved in rock, forged in steel, etc. When made active beside 
an opening or Gate, it makes that path unusable to minions 
of the Great Old Ones and Mythos Gods, as well as to those 
greater  beings  themselves.  Without  the  spell,  the  symbol 
itself means nothing and has no effect.

The  writings  of  certain  scribes  apart,  the  Elder  Sign  is 
worthless in personal defense if the monster or minion can 
evade the Sign. Those wearing an Elder Sign around the neck, 
for instance, might gain protection for a few square inches 
of flesh where the Sign rests against the skin; however, the 
rest of the wearer’s body would be completely vulnerable.

Alternative  names:  The  Elder  Seal,  The  Omen  Branch, 

The Five Points of Wisdom.

Enchantment Spells
A number of Enchant spells exist, each used to imbue magic 
into a different device or artifact. Each spell involves a blood 
sacrifice,  the  sacrifice  of  magic  points,  the  loss  of  1D4  or 
more Sanity points, and at least a game day of time.

There are four enchanted items of permanent duration 
for which no spell of creation is known: the Glass from Leng, 
the Lamp of Alhazred, the Plutonian Drug, and the Shining 
Trapezohedron.  These  four,  exceedingly  rare  items  are  in-
cluded  in  Chapter  15: Artifacts  and Alien  Devices  under 
their alphabetical entries, not in the list of enchantments.

Crafting an enchantment or an artifact brings risks. The 
item may have unpredictable advantages and disadvantages. 
While it might be useful for probing more deeply into the 
Mythos,  it  might  also  expose  investigators  to  monstrous 
encounters, or could offer a way to another dimension.

Keepers  should  consider  how  an  enchanted  item  or 
artifact may affect the game. Since the spell or the artifact is 
unlikely to vanish from play once introduced; it will alter the 
abilities (for good or ill) of the investigators. Make sure you 
are certain of what it does, what it costs and its implications 
for your game.

Enchant Knife
Cost: variable POW; 1D4 Sanity points
Casting time: 2 hours

An  enchanted  knife  increases  the  success  chance  for  other 
spells. The spell enchants a knife or dagger made of a pure 
metal, such as gold or iron. With the knife blade an intricate 
diagram is drawn on a flat surface and then the blade is used 
to kill an animal of at least SIZ 20. The creature’s blood is 
then traced out to follow the lines of the drawn diagram and 
the enchantment is complete.

Such  a  knife  is  suitable  for  use  in  casting  Summon 
Dimensional Shambler. Every point of POW placed into it 
adds  1  percentile  to  the  chance  for  success  in  casting  that 
spell.  If  this  knife  is  used  to  slay  the  small  animal  for  En-
chant Brazier, the brazier so made adds 10 percentiles to the 
chance for successfully casting Conjure Glass of Mortlan.

Enchant Pipes
Cost: variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: 3+ hours

Augments the chance for success in casting particular spells. 
The spell enchants a set of panpipes or a flute. The instru-
ment  must  be  at  least  90%  metal.  An  hour-long  ritual  of 
concentration and incantation must be performed over the 
musical  instrument,  during  which  Sanity  points  are  sacri-
ficed  by  the  caster,  who  must  also  sacrifice  POW  into  the 
instrument. For each lot of 5 POW sacrificed, the musical 
instrument must steep in fresh, warm blood for two hours. 
A new animal, of at least cat or rabbit size, must be slaugh-
tered for each 5 POW. For each point of POW it contains, 
the  finished  instrument  adds  2  percentiles  to  the  success 
chance  of  Summon/Bind  Servitor  of  the  Outer  Gods  and 
other spells requiring the use of pipes or flutes to cast.

Enchant Sacrificial Dagger
Cost: 30 POW
Casting time: 1 week

The  caster  creates  a  flame-shaped  dagger  over  which  this 
spell is performed. The dagger must then be used to kill a 
living being of at least 100 POW. Simultaneously, 30 points

Gate Spells

The idea of a panel that would open on some remote 
world impressed Eibon as being rather fantastic, not to say 
farfetched.

           —Clark Ashton Smith, The Door to Saturn.

Cost:  variable  POW  see  Table  XIII:  Gate  Creation  and 
Travel Costs
Cost to access a Gate: variable magic points and 1 Sanity 
point
Casting time: one hour per POW spent

Gate spells allow the caster to create doorways between other 
lands  or  times,  dimensions,  or  worlds—allowing  the  user 
to travel great distances with a simple step. Usually a Gate 
connects to a single other location. 

Creation of a Gate requires the permanent expenditure of 
POW, in a sacrifice equal to the log to base 10 of the distance 
the Gate connects in miles times five. A Gate may take many 
forms, common ones being indicated by a pattern of painted 
lines on a floor or a peculiar arrangement of stones in a field. 

Using the Gate costs a number of magic points equal to 
one-fifth of the POW originally used to make the Gate. Each 
trip through a Gate costs 1 Sanity point. Should the user lack 
enough magic points for a trip, the traveler expends hit points 
to make up the cost. Return trips through a Gate always cost 
the same as the initial journey.

Ordinarily, anyone or anything can move through a Gate, 
though some have been built so that a certain key—a word or 
gesture—is needed to activate the portal. Certain versions of 
the spell are known that also ‘change’ those who pass through, 
to aid survival on an alien world. There are also hints that some 
Gates are capable of more than one destination.

Find Gate

Cost: 1 magic point; 1D3 Sanity points
Casting time: 20-60 minutes

Through  a  series  of  gestures  and  a  specific  chant,  the  spell 
reveals to the caster any Gate if it is within the caster’s direct 
vision. 

While this spell locates a Gate, it does not empower any-
one to open, close, create, or pass through it. Neither does 
this  limited  form  of  the  spell  allow  the  caster  to  determine 
whether the Gate traverses time or distance.

Gate Boxes

Cost: 1 POW; variable magic points and Sanity points
Casting time: 5 hours

Allows the creation of twin magical boxes that form two ends 
of  a  magical  Gate.  Going  through  a  gate  box  costs  exactly 
the same magic points and Sanity points as going through a 
normal Gate and the transit procedure is the same.

First,  two  identical  wooden  boxes  must  be  made  to  any 
desired SIZ. The boxes should be open only at one end. Then 
the  necessary  ritual,  consisting  of  placing  one’s  hands  on  the 
boxes and conceiving certain hyper-dimensional lines and angles 
in one’s mind for about five hours must be performed. 5 POW 
is sacrificed at this time. Then the boxes automatically drain half 
the  creator’s  Magic  points  each  day,  until  they  have  absorbed 
magic points equal to their total SIZ x 20. 1 Sanity point is lost for 
every full week of magic point drain. Once the necessary magic 
points have been taken, the boxes become operative.

Time Gate

Cost: variable POW
Casting time: one hour per POW spent

Deeper Version
The  caster  may  elect  to  prepare  a  Gate  for  travel  by 
expending  the  necessary  magic  points  before  the 
journey. The Gate is thus primed and the next person 
stepping through the doorway is not required to pay 
the magic point cost, but will still need to sacrifice 1 
Sanity point.

Deeper Version
The  wizard  is,  through  the  use  of  diabolical  symbols 
and chants, able to create multi-pathway Time Gates—
thus one door may lead to more than one distant time 
or future. Only the caster knows which path leads to 
which time on entering the Gate. Those foolish enough 
to use the Gate unassisted by the caster will be unable 
to determine the correct path and could arrive at any 
of the times the Gate is keyed to (roll randomly). The 
process of creation remains the same.

256 

Call of Cthulhu 
Creates  a  gate  to  the  future  or  to 
the  past.  The  spell  resembles  the 
Create Gate spell but costs POW for 
the number of years travelled rather 
than the number of miles journeyed. 
Use the Gate Creation and Travel 
Costs Table and substitute distance 
in years for distance in miles. 

The  spell  only  yields  a  time 
approximate to that desired, though 
once such a Gate is created the exact 
interval between “now” and “then” 
remains the same. 

View Gate
Cost:  variable  magic  and  Sanity 
points
Casting time: 3 rounds

When cast at a suspected Gate, this 
spell  allows  the  caster  and  compan-
ions  to  see  what,  if  anything,  is  on 
the  other  side  of  the  Gate  without 
going through it. The cost varies with 
the  number  of  magic  points  needed 
to activate the Gate. It always costs 1 
magic point and 1 Sanity point to cast 
the spell. Viewing is a variable cost, 
one-tenth  of  the  Gate  cost  (round 
up fractions). Thus a Gate costing 7 
magic points to pass through requires 
2 magic points and 2 Sanity points to 
view through. The view lasts 1D6+1 
rounds.  The  spell  may  be  cast  as 
often as the caster’s magic points and 
Sanity points allow.

If  there  is  something  horrific  to 
see, additional Sanity charges should 
be required for each viewer. Viewers 
may attempt appropriate skill rolls to 
learn where or when or what is being 
viewing.

of  the  enchanter’s  own  POW  must  be 
sacrificed. From then on, when the dag-
ger is used properly to sacrifice chosen 
victims in the presence of Nyarlathotep, 
the  POW  of  the  victim  flows  into  the 
dagger,  and  from  the  dagger  the  POW 
can  be  sent  to  any  convenient  storage 
site—the caster or an inanimate object.

Enchant Whistle
Cost: variable POW; 1D4 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 day

Augments  the  caster’s  chance  to  Sum-
mon/Bind Byakhee. The spell enchants 
a  whistle,  which  must  be  an  alloy  of 
silver and iron meteorite. For each point 
of POW sacrificed to the whistle, add 2 
percentiles to the chance of successfully 
casting Summon/Bind Byakhee.

Enthrall Victim
Cost: 2 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 round

The caster must be able to speak calmly 
with the target before the spell can take 
effect.  After  a  round  or  so  of  talking, 
an  opposed  POW  roll  must  be  made 
between the caster and target on 1D100. 
If  overcome,  the  victim  stands  struck, 
numb  and  dumb,  until  relieved  from 
the  trance  by  physical  assault  or  some 
similarly  shocking  event.  If  the  caster 
fails  to  overcome  the  target,  he  or  she 
may try the spell the following round.

Alternative  names:  Strike  Dumb,  The 

Silver Beguiling Tongue.

Evil Eye
Cost:  10  magic  points;  1D4  Sanity 
points
Casting time: 1 round

Casting this spell causes a victim to suffer 
from bad luck. While the target must be 
within sight of the caster, the victim will 
not necessarily sense the Evil Eye spell’s 
influence, but is likely to feel an odd chill 
or unease when the Evil Eye is cast.

With  a  successful  casting,  the  vic-
tim’s  chance  for  a  Luck  roll  is  halved*. 
*Neither  can  the  victim  spend  or  gain 
luck points if the Optional Luck Rule is 
being used. 

Call of CthulhuThe victim must apply one penalty die to all character-
istic rolls, and his or her guns jam on every roll of 75% or 
higher.  The  chances  for  Summon/Bind  spells  are  halved. 
The effects continue until the next sunrise, until the caster 
removes the spell, until the caster is found and blooded (hit 
hard enough to bleed), or until the victim dies.

Alternative  names:  Ye  Rite  of  Ill  Fortune,  Dark  Curse, 

Witches’ Hex.

Fist of Yog-Sothoth
Cost: variable magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: Instantaneous

The  caster  causes  a  massive,  invisible  force  to  hit  a  single 
target. The caster must be able to see the target.

Each magic point invested in the spell yields 2D10 STR 
of force. For every 30 feet of distance that the caster stands 
from the target (after the first thirty feet), the caster must 
spend an additional magic point.

When the target is struck (if a living thing), an opposed 
roll must be made using the spell’s STR versus the target’s 
CON.  If  successful,  the  target  is  knocked  unconscious. 
Whether or not the target is left unconscious, the target is 
always  pushed  away  from  the  caster  for  a  distance  in  feet 
equal to the STR of the blow minus the target’s SIZ.

The  spell  can  be  used  against  the  STR  of  inanimate 
objects such as doors or walls. Results may be obvious, but 
sometimes Keepers will have to determine these cases.

For  example:  The  caster  spends  5  magic  points  to  hit 
an investigator 50 feet away. 1 magic point is spent on the 
range. The other 4 generate a STR of 8D10 that are rolled 
for  a  result  of  57.  The  investigator  fails  a  Hard  CON  roll 
(since  the  spells  STR  is  over  50)  and  so  they  are  knocked 
unconscious. The investigator has a SIZ of 45 and is bowled 
back 12 feet by the impact.

of the Way, Smite Down Thine Enemy, The Hideous Blast of 
the Foul One.

Green Decay
Cost: 15 magic points; 10 POW; 2D8 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 day

A curse that turns an individual into a green pile of mold. A 
day must be spent focusing energy upon the intended target 
of  the  spell  and  reciting  an  incantation  to  Gla'aki.  In  the 
next  24  hours  the  caster  must  personally  give  a  green  leaf 
to the target. At dawn on the following day, for the spell to 
take effect, an opposed POW roll must be made between the 
caster and target on 1D100. If the target fails the green decay 
has begun.

Over  the  next  seven  days  the  target  effectively  turns 
into  a  green  mold.  At  first  green  blotches  appear  on  the 
skin. These then begin to grow mold-like hairs. As the days 
progress,  more  and  more  of  the  victim’s  skin  grows  green 
and the skin rots. In tandem, the victim’s organs also rot. By 
the sixth day the victim’s mental facilities rapidly deteriorate 
and movement becomes impossible. The only known cure is 
to find and kill the caster, which reverses the spell’s effects.

The only known written transcriptions of this hideous 
spell  are  within  the  Book  of  Eibon  and  the  Revelations  of 
Gla'aki.

Alternative names: The Creeping Mold, Ye Rotting Aw-

fulness. 

Implant Fear
Cost: 12 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: Instantaneous

This  spell  causes  soul-chilling  dread,  breaking  the  target’s 
concentration and disrupting his or her actions. The caster 
must  be  able  to  see  and  point  a  finger  at  the  target  while 
invoking a curse.

The  sudden  unnerving  costs  the  target  0/1D6  Sanity 
points and they feel compelled to retreat to a safe place—
anywhere the person would normally feel safe and secure.

Alternative  names:  Finger  of  Doom,  Eibon’s  Jinx,  The 

Evil Eye.

Flesh Ward
Cost: variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
Casting time: 5 rounds

Grants protection against physical attack. Each magic point 
spent gives the caster (or the chosen target) 1D6 points of 
armor  against  non-magical  attacks.  This  protection  wears 
off as it blocks damage. For example, if a character had 12 
points of Flesh Ward as armor and was hit for 8 points of 
damage, the Flesh Ward would be reduced to 4 points, yet 
he or she would take no damage. The spell lasts 24 hours or 
until the protection is used up. 

Once cast, the spell may not be reinforced with further 
magic points, nor recast until the old spell’s protection has 
been used up.

Alternative  names:  Protect  Thee  from  Mighty  Blows, 

Armour of the Will, Blood Shield.

Melt Flesh
Cost (dead flesh): 1 magic point per 15 SIZ of dead flesh; 
1D4 Sanity points
Cost (living flesh): 5 magic points per 15 SIZ of living flesh; 
1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: 5 rounds

This devilish spell heats flesh (dead or living) to its melting 
point in one round. If used on animate flesh, the cost is sub-
stantially higher to the caster in magic points. The victim’s 
flesh is melted causing horrific disfigurement (1D4 damage 
per 15 SIZ points affected). In certain cases, such as where 
the face is targeted, the victim may become blind or lose the 
ability to hear, and possibly suffocate unless air vents can be 
quickly created. Seeing human flesh melt off human bones 
costs 1/1D6 Sanity points.

chapter 12: grimoireMental Suggestion
Cost: variable magic points and Sanity points
Casting time: 3 rounds

The caster can command any being with human blood in 
its veins. A single target, who is visible to the unaided eye 
of  the  sorcerer,  is  affected.  The  victim  carries  out  all  that 
is  commanded  by  the  caster,  even  to  self-destruction.  The 
spell  also  works  against  Lengites,  deep  one  hybrids,  ghoul 
changelings, Little People, serpent folk and deep ones who 
have interbred with humans, but doesn’t work on nonhu-
man entities such as shantaks or dimensional shamblers.

The caster intones the spell and relates the suggestion to 
the target. For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed 
in  an  opposed  POW  roll  with  the  target.  Extreme  sugges-
tions  involving  death  or  great  harm  require  a  second  op-
posed POW roll just before the suggestion is implemented.

The  cost  for  the  spell  varies  with  the  suggestion.  For 
ordinary unthreatening suggestions (drop your sword, hand 
over your money and leave, etc.), the cost is 5 magic points 
and 1D3 Sanity points. Riskier suggestions, but not ones an-
tithetical to the target (go to Dunwich, set fire to a building, 
etc.), cost 10 magic points and 2D3 Sanity points. Danger-
ous  or  suicidal  suggestions  (kill  a  companion,  kidnap  the 
President, etc.) cost 15 magic points and 3D3 Sanity points.
If  used  on  an  investigator  the  effects  lasts  for  1  round 
for each point of INT the caster possesses. If the INT of the 
investigator is higher than that of the caster, the caster must 
win  another  POW  roll  every  10  rounds.  When  the  caster 
fails the spell is broken.

Mindblast
Cost: 10 magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
Casting time: Instantaneous

The  victim  of  this  spell  suffers  a  terrible  mental  assault, 
causing the loss of 5 Sanity points and inducing temporary 
insanity. For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed 
in an opposed POW roll with the target. 

The  target  is  affected  as  per  the  rules  for  temporary 
insanity, beginning with a bout of madness, and may con-
tinue to suffer from flashbacks and/or nightmares for days 
following. 

Alternative  names:  Curse  of  Enfeeblement,  Wave  of 

Doom, Abyss of the Mind’s Eye.

Mind Exchange
Cost: 10+1D6 magic points; 1D3 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 hour

Allows  the  caster  to  trade  minds  with  another  individual. 
The caster loses 1D3 Sanity points and must expend magic 
points equal to one-fifth of the target’s POW the first time 
the spell is cast. Thereafter, the cost goes down 1 magic point 

per casting until it reaches 1, where it remains. The Sanity 
point cost does not decrease. 

The target must know the spell caster and love or strong-
ly  favor  him  or  her.  If  that  affection  is  somehow  lost,  the 
exchange  can  no  longer  occur.  Fresh  affection  renews  the 
chance. Upon arriving in another’s body, the target loses a 
minimum of 1/1D3 Sanity points.

This spell can be cast at any range. For the spell to take 
effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with 
the  target,  until  the  magic  point  cost  for  casting  the  spell 
has  been  reduced  to  1,  when  an  opposed  POW  roll  is  no 
longer required and the caster can transfer at will, using only 
a strong mental effort. 

The  spell  caster  cannot  initially  stay  more  than  a  few 
minutes  inside  the  target’s  body,  but  progressively  is  able 
to longer and longer. Once the cost for transfer is 1 magic 
point, he or she can stay there indefinitely.

Alternative  names:  Vice  Versa  Incantation,  Rite  of  Ex-

change, The Cloak of Another’s Flesh.

Mind Transfer
Cost: 10 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
Casting time: 5 rounds or more

A  powerful  spell  allowing  the  caster  to  permanently  trade 
minds with a target, perhaps to attain longer life at the tar-
get’s expense. 

For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an 
opposed POW roll with the target. With success, the caster 
loses 1D10 Sanity points and the victim loses 1D20 Sanity 
points.  If  the  exchange  fails,  the  caster  must  immediately 
cast the spell again (losing 10 more magic points) or his or 
her soul dissipates into eternity. Once the transfer is begun, 
it cannot be broken off.

A  successful  casting  means  that  the  caster  has  perma-
nently taken control of the target’s body. The caster’s previ-
ous body is now a hollow, dead thing. As for the mind of the 
target, conjecture suggests that it is expelled from the body 
and thus dies; however some hint that it remains inside its 
own body, subservient to the caster’s mind and locked in a 
permanent state of horrific madness. 

Deeper Version
Wizards, fearful of death or eager to ensure longevity, 
may prepare the Mind Transfer spell many years in ad-
vance of its casting. Such preparations usually concern 
some personal item (such as a portrait or diary), wherein 
the spell is keyed, awaiting the right conditions for it to 
come to fruition. Often the key is some future descen-
dant of the caster who unknowingly activates the spell.

Call of CthulhuMirror of Tarkhun Atep
Cost: 5 magic points; 1 Sanity point
Casting time: half a day

Prinn’s Crux Ansata
Cost: 25 POW; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: variable days

As a harassment or warning, the caster is able to project his 
or her image onto the surface of a mirror, or mirroring sur-
face, that is being gazed into by the caster’s intended victim. 
The victim can be anywhere on Earth. The caster needs 
a mirror large enough to reflect his or her head and neck. 
Gazing into this mirror and keeping an image of the target 
in  mind,  he  or  she  utters  the  short  incantation  and  waits. 
When the target next looks into a darkened window, a mir-
ror,  or  any  other  reflective  surface,  an  image  of  the  caster 
begins to form. If the caster tires before the target looks into 
a mirror, that loss of attention breaks the spell.

Sometimes  the  mirror  image  of  the  caster  is  looking 
directly into the eyes of the victim. At other times the caster 
is seen standing directly behind the victim in the reflection. 
If the victim wears glasses, images reflected from the lenses 
may even be resolved. The target can hear words and short 
phrases  uttered  by  the  caster.  The  caster  can  see  through 
his or her mirror as well, and see the target and the target’s 
surroundings.

Powder of Ibn-Ghazi
Cost: 1 magic point per dose 
Casting time: 2 days' preparation, 1 round to apply

Those without the telescope saw only an instant’s flash of 
grey cloud—a cloud about the size of a moderately large 
building—near the top of the mountain. Curtis, who held 
the instrument, dropped it with a piercing shriek into the 
ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled, and would have 
crumpled to the ground had not two or three others seized 
and steadied him. All he could do was moan half-inaudibly.
—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dunwich Horror

This spell makes visible magically invisible things by blowing 
the  powder  against  or  over  the  invisible  thing.  The  powder 
must  be  compounded  carefully,  according  to  exacting  in-
structions,  and  involves  three  special  ingredients  and  the 
sacrifice of 1 magic point per dose. A dose is one application 
of the powder. The Keeper determines the special ingredients. 
The powder is either blown from a tube or thrown over 
the target. The thing that is dusted stays visible for no more 
than ten heartbeats.

That which could be made visible includes the magical 
lines extending from a place enchanted for the Calling of a 
Mythos deity, the aura around a Gate, or a creature that is 
normally invisible, such as a star vampire. Using the powder 
costs no Sanity points, but seeing what it exposes may.

Alternative names: Dust of Seeing, Witness of the Unseen, 

Compound of Perception.

This spell creates an ankh (looped cross) that can temporar-
ily or permanently banish individual Mythos creatures. The 
object must be an ankh made of an unalloyed metal—pure 
copper, iron, silver, gold, or lead would be the easiest metals 
to find and to form. For 20 minus a number of days equal 
to one-fifth of the caster’s INT, the caster performs episodic 
rites and sacrifices, and then sacrifices the necessary POW 
and Sanity points to enchant the ankh.

To  combat  the  Mythos,  the  caster  intones  a  chant  for 
three  rounds  and  expends  any  number  of  magic  points. 
Companions  of  the  caster  may  contribute  1  magic  point 
each; in token of the 25 POW already sacrificed, the caster 
adds 5 free magic points as well. For the spell to take effect 
the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the 
target. If a number of magic points equal to or greater than 
one-fifth of target’s POW are spent, the caster gains a bonus 
die  on  the  opposed  POW  roll.  In  addition,  the  limitation 
of affecting beings of higher POW is increased, so that the 
caster may challenge a being with POW equal to his or hers 
plus 200.

Any  person  who  knows  the  chant  may  wield  the  ankh 
and attempt to banish a creature, but does not get the five 
magic-point  increase  granted  to  the  original  caster.  If  the 
ankh-wielder and companions overcome the creature, it is 
dispelled to its home plane. If they fail to dispel the thing, it 
attacks the ankh-wielder first before turning its attention to 
others present.

Red Sign of Shudde M’ell
Cost:  3  magic  points;  1D8  Sanity  points;  1  hit  point  per 
round
Casting time: 1 round

An  awful  spell  that  causes  one  or  several  victims  to  die 
horribly. The caster inscribes in the air the dreaded sign of 
Shudde M’ell, while speaking words of power. When formed 
correctly, a dull red symbol glows in the air as the caster’s 
finger  describes  it.  The  sign’s  malevolent  effects  manifest 
the round after its creation. Once formed, the sign must be 
maintained by concentration and the expenditure of 3 more 
magic points each additional round.

All those within 10 yards of the sign lose 1D3 hit points 
per  round  as  their  bodies  quake  and  spasm,  and  their 
internal  organs  and  blood  vessels  convulse.  Those  further 
than 10 yards but nearer than 30 yards lose 1 hit point each 
round. Those further than 30 yards take no damage. 

It is possible to escape the sign’s effect by crawling be-
hind a stout wall or other opaque barrier. The caster must 
stand  next  to  the  sign  and  concentrate.  The  caster  loses  1 
hit point each round because of their proximity to the sign.
Alternative names: The Red Sign, The Mark of Fiery Pain.

261 

chapter 12: grimoireDeeper Version
The  caster  may  empower  the  red  sign  further  by  in-
vesting 5 POW into its creation. This done, the sign 
causes 1D6 hit points loss per round to those within 
10 yards and 2 hit points loss to those within 30 yards. 
Alternatively,  the  caster  may  elect  to  cause  the 
sign  to  expel  its  dark  energy  in  a  single  blast.  The 
caster creates the sign as usual and invests it with 10 
POW. On 1D4 rounds following, the sign will explode 
in blaze of red light causing 2D8 damage to everything 
within 50 yards (including the caster).

Shrivelling
Cost: Variable magic points; Sanity points
Casting time: Instantaneous 

A powerful offensive spell causing physical injury to a tar-
get. The caster invests as many magic points as desired and 
that  number  halved  in  Sanity  points.  For  the  spell  to  take 
effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with 
the target. If successful, the target is subjected to a sudden 
and terrifying blast of energy, causing flesh to blacken and 
wither. The target loses 1 hit point per magic point invested 
in the spell. 

Alternative  names:  Shriving,  The  Withering  Blast  of

Resurrection
Cost: 3 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 or 2 rounds

He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its 
bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which 
the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth 
a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume 
and opacity.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward

The  spell  reduces  a  corpse  to  its  essential  salts  and  com-
pounds,  a  bluish-grey  powder,  or  reverses  the  process  to 
yield ultimately the form and soul of the deceased. A com-
plete corpse is necessary. 

Being Resurrected in this manner costs the victim 1D20 

Sanity points.

If only part of the ashy powder is available for the spell, 
the sorcerer gets “onlie the liveliest awfullness” from what’s 
then made flesh. But the successfully resurrected need not 
be all in one piece—as long as the coffin is intact and suffi-
cient care is taken to scrape together all the fragments and 
dust within, the spell succeeds.

Reciting the spell backward returns the resurrected enti-
ty to dust and likewise requires the expenditure of 3 magic 
points  and  1D10  Sanity  points.  The  dust  can  be  retained 
or thrown away. For the spell to take effect the caster must 
succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. If the caster 
wins, the victim returns to dust. If the victim wins, it may try 
to prevent the caster from reciting the spell again. Reciting 
the spell backward takes two rounds. In The Case of Charles 
Dexter Ward, many of those resurrected were interrogated 
and tortured to reveal secrets of the past.

Alternative  names:  The  Rite  of  Knowledge  Long  Lost, 

Recrudance, Rite of Salts.

Deeper Version
Calling up the powerful energies of the Mythos is one 
thing; shaping them through understanding and com-
prehension is another. Casters are able to inflict Resur-
rection without the need for a POW roll. In addition, 
the  caster  may  elect  to  induce  further  mental  terror 
for  the  victim;  while  reeling  from  the  energy  blast, 
the  target  believes  that  he  or  she  is  being  assaulted 
by horrific Mythos entities, causing 1/1D6 Sanity loss.

Song of Hastur
Cost: 1D4 magic points per round; 1D4 Sanity points per 
round
Casting time: 3 rounds before it begins to take effect 

A hideous wailing ululation by the caster causes the skin and 
flesh of the chosen victim to bubble and fester into pestilent 
blobs.

The target must be visible to the caster. Though everyone 
can hear the song, the spell affects only the person chosen as 
target. This spell will not work except at night and only if the 
star Aldebaran is visible. A roll equal to or under the caster’s 
POW must be made to sing the correct alien melody.

Successfully  cast,  the  spell  causes  the  target  1D6  hit 
points damage per round the spell is active. After every two 
rounds,  scarring  reduces  the  victim’s  APP  by  3D10.  After 
every four rounds, internal ruptures lower the victim’s CON 
by 3D10. When the victim’s CON reaches 0 or death occurs 
from  hit  point  loss,  the  body  swells  up  and  bursts  with  a 
sickening—pop!—as steamy gore spills onto the floor.

The  song  can  be  used  defensively,  to  guard  against 
another  caster  of  this  spell.  Successful  opposing  castings 
neutralize each other.

bound; with a failure, it attacks the caster and then returns 
from whence it came. Bound, the thing must obey one order 
by the caster, even to attacking its own kind, after which it is 
freed and returns from whence it came.

Deeper Version
The  clarity  of  understanding  and  tuning  to  the 
mysteries  of  Hastur  allow  the  caster  to  comprehend 
the  secrets  of  Hali  and  the  necessary  alignments  of 
Aldebaran in space and time. Thus the spell may be 
cast when Aldebaran is not visible in the night sky. 

In  addition,  the  caster  may  weave  an  echo  of  the 
song into a piece of yellow cloth taken from the court 
of the King in Yellow. Investing 20 magic points into the 
pale material means that the next person to touch the 
cloth suffers the effects of the spell for 10 rounds—the 
victim may attempt to roll equal to or below half their 
POW each round, with success ending the spell’s effects.

Summoning Spells
Cost: variable magic points; 1D4 Sanity points
Casting  time:  5  minutes  per  magic  point  spent,  binding 
takes 1 round.

Such spells concern themselves with alien races and atten-
dants, those monsters that commonly serve greater monsters 
or wizards. The general procedures for these spells are the 
same, but conditions may vary from spell to spell. Knowing 
one such spell is of no use whatsoever in attempting to cast 
another. Unless the Keeper wishes otherwise, the summon 
and  the  bind  portions  of  each  spell  are  learned  together. 
Foolish is the impatient wizard who only learns to summon 
and not to bind.

With  the  exception  of  Summon/Bind  Servitor  of  the 
Outer  Gods,  these  spells  require  the  sacrifice  of  1  magic 
point per 10 percentiles chance for success. For example, 3 
magic points gives a 30% chance for the spell to succeed. In 
general, for each magic point spent, the caster must spend 
five minutes chanting—the greater the chance for success, 
the longer the spell takes to cast. A result of 96-100 is always 
a  failure—a  rolled  result  of  100  should  always  have  bad 
consequences for the wizard concerned.

The  caster  also  loses  1D4  Sanity  points  per  spell  cast, 

whether the spell succeeds or not.

Form of the Command

The caster’s command to the thing must be specific and lim-
ited in duration: “protect me from harm forever,” would not 
be a valid command; however, “slay that man in the corner,” 
would be. The thing is bound to the caster until it fulfills a 
command (a bound thing without a command soon finds a 
way to leave). Orders might include carrying someone some-
where, presiding at some ceremony, being especially docile 
while being examined by a group of professors, appearing 
somewhere as a warning to those assembled—whatever can 
be imagined.

Keep  commands  simple.  The  best  rule  of  thumb  is 
that a command have no more words than one-fifth of the 
thing’s INT. Simple gestures such as pointing will be under-
stood. Assume  that  the  thing  is  always  able  to  understand 
a straightforward command, whether spoken in English or 
Urdu. See also Separate Binding, below.

Summon  Byakhee:  a  whistle  must  be  blown  during  the 
chant.  This  spell  is  active  only  on  nights  when  Aldebaran 
is above the horizon (October through March are the best 
months). The summoned byakhee will flap down out of the 
sky, still icy from its travels through space.

If  the  whistle  is  enchanted,  each  point  of  POW  in  its 
enchantment  adds  2  percentiles  to  the  chance  for  success. 
Such a whistle may be used again and again.

Alternative names: Call into Service Thy Steed, The Mel-

Summon Dark Young: brings present a single dark young. 
A beast of at least SIZ 40 must be sacrificed. The summoner

of  the  moon.  A  dark  young  will  stalk  out  of  the  shadows 
after the summoning.

Alternative names: Envoke the Darke of the Forest, Knife

Summon  Dimensional  Shambler:  a  single  dimensional 
shambler gradually assembles itself out of thin air. The spell 
requires a dagger made from any pure metal such as copper 
or iron. Alloys such as brass will not work. If the dagger is 
enchanted, the chance for success also rises by 2 percentiles 
per point of POW in the dagger. This spell may be cast day 
or night. One authority has written that shamblers are more 
easily confused in bright sunlight.

Alternative  names:  Recitation  to  Bring  the  Wanderer,

If  a  success,  one  being  appears  per  spell,  2D10  game 
minutes after the chant concludes. The thing appearing may 
also require a Sanity loss to see it.

Keeper may ask that the caster make an opposed POW roll 
versus  the  summoned  being.  With  a  success,  the  thing  is 

Summon Fire Vampire: causes one fire vampire to swoop 
down from the sky like a skittering star. A bonfire or other

tember through November are the best times in moderately 
northern latitudes).

Summon  Servitor  Of  The  Outer  Gods:  A  single  servitor 
arrives amid haunting echoes of insane piping. The magic 
point  cost  is  triple  that  of  the  standard  summoning  spell; 
for each three magic points sacrificed, increase the chance 
for a successful cast by 10 percentiles; a result of 96-100 is 
always a failure. Each cast of this spell also costs 3D4 Sanity 
points. A  flute  is  also  needed  to  cast  this  spell;  if  the  flute 
is enchanted, it increases the chance for the spell’s success 
by 2 percentiles per point of POW within the flute. Cultists 
cast  this  spell  anywhere  and  at  any  time  that  is  especially 
unhallowed—typical  nights  would  be  Midsummer’s  Eve, 
Samhain, and Walpurgis Night.

a book in which are written or inscribed the words of the 
spell. If the book is enchanted, the chance for success is in-
creased by 2 percentiles per point of POW within the book. 
This  spell  can  be  cast  only  at  night  under  a  cloudless  sky. 
The creature is invisible save when its veins fill with blood 
from some visible creature.

Separate Binding
Cost: 1 Sanity point
Casting time: 1 round

Binding  and  Summoning  are  two  sides  of  the  same  coin. 
Sometimes  they  are  learned  as  one  spell,  sometimes  not. 
At the Keeper’s discretion the effects may be combined or 
two separate rolls might be asked for, one to summon and a 
second to bind.

If a monster arrives unbound or is come upon unexpect-
edly, it may be bound on the spot. The caster must know the 
Summon/Bind spell for that type of thing and must spend 
a  round  chanting  before  the  thing  can  be  bound.  For  the 
spell  to  take  effect  the  caster  must  succeed  in  an  opposed 

POW roll with the target. Each cast of the binding costs 1 
Sanity point and variable magic points. A binding works on 
only one creature at a time. One option open to the caster 
is to invest a number of magic points equal to one-fifth of 
the summoned creature’s POW to gain a bonus die on the 
opposed POW roll to bind the monster (of course, the caster 
will  not  know  the  POW  of  the  creature,  thus  must  take  a 
gamble on how many magic points to sacrifice).

An attacking creature cannot be bound by the person it 
is fighting; however, it could be bound by a person able to 
hold back from the fray. A creature presently bound cannot 
be  re-bound  until  its  present  command  is  completed.  A 
creature to be bound must be visible to the caster and within 
100  yards.  Binding  requires  an  opposed  roll  and  opposed 
rolls  cannot  be  pushed;  if  the  opposed  roll  is  failed,  the 
caster is in trouble!

Bind  Byakhee:  If  an  enchanted  whistle  is  used,  the  caster 
gains a bonus die on the opposed POW roll. Such a whistle 
may be used again and again.

An ancient and powerful hand gesture used by wizards that 
benefits  the  casting  of  other  spells.  It  may  lessen  the  cost, 
reduce the casting time or increase the effect a little, depend-
ing on the spell in question. 

Voorish Sign is also rumored to temporarily ward against 
Mythos monsters—such creatures are wary of the sign and 
may hold off an attack until the wizard’s intentions are known.

Alternative names: Sign of Power, Cunninge Pass.

Warding 
Cost: 1 magic point per stone
Casting time: 5 rounds

A number of ordinary white stones are placed on the ground 
as the caster pleases, except that each must be within a yard 
of  each  of  the  others. When  cast,  a  shimmering  heat  haze 
can be seen over the stones. Thereafter if any stone is moved, 
the caster will be aware of the fact, even if asleep until then. 
Once this has occurred, the spell is broken.

Alternative  names:  Stones  of  Safekeeping,  Leave  Thy 

Burden to the Rock, Circle of Protection.

Wave of Oblivion 
Cost: 30 magic points; 1D8 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 hour

A mighty spell that causes a powerful ocean wave to smash 
down  at  the  caster’s  direction.  The  caster  must  be  able  to 
see the intended target and sufficient quantities of salt water 
must be present to create the wave. The caster stands in the 
water to cast the spell.

The wave volume is 3,000 cubic feet, enough to swamp 
or capsize a small sloop. Needless to say, people swallowed 
up by such waves vanish forever below the surface.

Others can contribute magic points to the spell to create 
vast  waves  capable  of  sinking  ocean  liners,  battleships,  or 
Manhattan Island. Those knowing the spell can contribute 
as many magic points as desired and must expend 1D8 San-
ity points. Those who do not know the spell can contribute 
1 magic point each. At a minimum of 30 magic points, the 
wave is ten feet long, ten feet wide and thirty feet high. Each 
additional magic point adds a foot to the length and width 
of the wave.

Alternative names: Song of the Ocean’s Fist, The Salt Gift, 

Ye Watery Doom.

Wither Limb 
Cost: 8 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: Instantaneous

A terrifying spell designed to torment and cause permanent 
damage to a target. The caster must be within 10 yards of 
the target. For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed 
in  an  opposed  POW  roll  with  the  target.  If  successful,  the 
caster nominates an arm or leg. The said appendage rapidly 
and  painfully  withers  and  shrivels,  causing  1D8  hit  points 
of damage and a permanent loss of 2D10 CON. The victim  
loses 1D4/1D8 Sanity points.

Alternative names: The Song of Pain, Shrivel Thy Enemy, 

The Wasting Burn.

Words of Power
Cost: 3+ magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: 10+ minutes

The  caster  creates  an  intense  bond  with  a  large  group  of 
listeners.  The  caster  must  speak  extemporaneously  and 
seemingly from the heart, maintaining the audience’s atten-
tion. For each ten minutes of speech, the caster must expend 
3 magic points and make a successful communication roll 
as the Keeper thinks appropriate (Charm or Persuade), or 
the speech ends indecisively and in confusion. At the end of 
a successful speech, the audience thoroughly believes what 
has been said for 1D3 days.

Alternative names: Sekhmenkenhep’s Words, Beguile the 

Unrighteous, Mastery of the Mob.

Wrack 
Cost: 3 magic points; 1 Sanity point
Casting time: 1 round

This spell will temporarily incapacitate a single target who 
is within 10 yards of the caster. For the spell to take effect 
the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the 
target. Intense, wracking pains seize the target, the face and 
hands blister and drip fluid, and the eyes cloud with blood 
and  become  temporarily  sightless.  The  target  is  rendered 
completely helpless during the period of the spell’s effect.

The effect lasts 1D6 rounds, after which sight returns. In 
3D10 minutes, the target fully recovers and can resume nor-
mal activity. Traces of physical corruption fade quickly and in 
24 hours only faint blemishes can be seen on the skin. Each 
such experience costs the target 1/1D6+1 Sanity points.

Alternative  names:  Woeful  Agony  of  the Wretched,  The 

Festering Blindness of the Seven Hells, Rend Enemy.

Call of Cthulhutend 

lthough  most 
to  see 
investigators 
creatures  of  the  Mythos  as  little  more  than 
malignant  monsters,  in  truth  many  of  them 
have  vibrant  and  technologically  advanced 
societies.  Advanced  races  such  as  the  elder 
things,  mi-go,  serpent  people,  and Yithians  all  possess  the 
ability to construct and utilize technology in the pursuit of 
their agendas.

Mythos  races,  human  cultists,  and  wizards  may  occa-
sionally have access to ancient and otherworldly artifacts as 
well as to scientific marvels. A selection of technology and 
arcane artifacts follows.

Most  humans  would  be  unable  to  tell  the  difference 
between  a  piece  of  advanced  scientific  equipment  and  a 
magical  Mythos  artifact,  as  both  are  essentially  beyond 
mankind’s level of comprehension and ability to reproduce. 
Indeed, what mankind may consider to be high magic could 
well be technological in nature, and vice versa.

Mi-Go

Not only are the mi-go technologically  
advanced (several hundred years beyond that 
of Earth), but they also are eager to use it; 
technology is very much part of their daily 
life. The mi-go originally came to Earth to 
steal certain minerals they could not find on 
their own worlds. Thus, most technology that 
the mi-go have brought to Earth relates to 
mining or to war. 

The mi-go also touch upon the edges of 

the dark technology of the Mythos Gods, 
perhaps more so than any other Mythos race. 
They created Ghadamon, a larval Great Old 
One, from a Seed of Azathoth; they formed 
the Shining Trapezohedron, which has a  
peculiar power over an aspect of Nyarlathotep; 
and they constructed a network of magical 
gates which tie together many of their  
outposts.

The longevity of their stay on Earth to 

perform experiments on and study Earth’s life 
forms would suggest the possibility of more 
arcane technology existing in hidden mi-go 
outposts. Mi-go advanced knowledge of  
medical and surgical techniques must be 
noted. They are able to remove a human brain 
from its body and preserve it for thousands 
of years, totally functional. In addition they 
can create authentic-looking biological  
automatons and engage in many surgical  
techniques that humans would consider 
miraculous.

Wherever such technology resides, the  

mi-go guard it jealously and will pursue  
anyone foolish enough to steal it away.

Bio-Web Armor

Bio-Web Armor 

Used by: Mi-go
In  dangerous  situations,  mi-go  typically  don  these  webs 
of  semi-luminous  green  slime.  The  harnesses  provides  8 
points of armor against blows, flame, electricity, etc.

Humans  may  wear  these  bio-webs,  but  take  1  point 
of damage as hair and flesh is ripped away each time the 
armor is removed. A bio-web will slowly degrade because 
humans do not exude the proper nutrient solutions to care 
for it. 

Each time it is worn by a human, a bio-web decreases 
in protection by one point. When no armor points remain, 
the  armor  disintegrates  into  a  steaming,  sticky  pool  of 
viscous matter. Whether there are significant side effects to 
wearing this armor is unknown.

Black Lotus Powder

Used by: Serpent people
A  mind-bending  psychedelic,  also  known  as  “black  sty-
gian,” used by serpent people as a means of torture to ex-
tract information. In minute quantities the lotus powder 
is  a  mild  hallucinogen,  equivalent  to  magic  mushrooms; 
however in larger doses the drug may reduce those taking 
it to insane, driveling idiots.

268 

Call of CthulhuThe  drug  can  be  administered  either  by  injection  (the 
powder when heated turns to liquid) or by inhalation (the 
black smoke given-off smells like burnt toffee). If more than 
the  usual  (recreational)  dose  is  administered,  the  victim 
immediately begins to hallucinate for 1D6 minutes per dose. 
The visions are totally immersive and horrifying, granting 
insights  into  the  unspeakable  knowledge  of  the  Mythos—
some serpent men claim that it is like looking into the very 
face of Azathoth. 1D4 Sanity points are lost per minute the 
drug is active. During this period, the victim is highly sus-
ceptible  to  questioning,  readily  revealing  information  and 
close-kept secrets. Towards the end, the victim’s body goes 
into spasm until collapsing into unconsciousness for 1D10 
hours. It is not uncommon for the victim to wake up totally 
insane.

Accounts  suggest  that  the  black  lotus  flower  was  rare 
even  in  the  time  of  famed Valusia  and  today  it  is  thought 
the infamous plant is long extinct. However, from time to 
time, ancient vials and jars have been uncovered containing 
quantities of black stygian powder. It is unknown, yet pre-
sumable, that modern science might be able to analyze the 
powder’s compounds and recreate them.

Brain Cylinder 

Used by: Mi-go
These shiny cylinders are used to preserve extracted brains. 
Lovecraft described them as, “a foot high and somewhat less 
in  diameter,  with  three  curious  sockets  set  in  an  isosceles 
triangle over the front convex surface.” 

Each cylinder is filled with a nutrient solution that sus-
tains the brain within. Three accessory machines—a tall rig 
with twin lenses mounted on front, a box with vacuum-tubes 
and  a  sounding  board,  and  a  small  box  with  a  metal  disc 
on top—comprise the mi-go sensing apparatus. These ma-
chines, when connected to the proper sockets, provide the 
brain  with  the  faculties  of  sight,  speech,  and  hearing.  The 
mi-go, not possessed of human senses, have done their best; 

however  it  is  but  an  approximation  of  sound  and  vision. 
All visual input is grainy, of low general resolution and the 
audio is flat, like that of a monaural phonograph. Speech, 
with all its nuances of inflection and emotion, is utterly lost 
on the fungi. The speech machine talks with a mechanical, 
monotone voice, devoid of emotion. When the sensory ma-
chines  are  disconnected  or  deactivated,  the  encased  brain 
falls into a semi-insane sleep state filled with strange dreams 
and hallucinations.

Every  month  a  human  brain  is  enclosed  within  a 
cylinder,  the  brain  must  roll  under  or  equal  to  its  INT.  If 
successful, the brain remembers it is stuck inside a tin can 
and loses 1D3 Sanity points.

Carotid Toxin 

Used by: Serpent people
A rare poison that causes a slow degeneration of the carotid ar-
teries. The toxin slowly eats away at the carotid arteries, causing 
massive internal bleeding and almost inevitable death.

The effect of the poison takes a number of days equal to 
one-fifth of the victim’s CON. After this period an Extreme 
CON roll must be made, otherwise the imbiber suffers an 
agonizing  death  over  the  course  of  1D3  days.  If  the  CON 
roll  is  successful,  the  imbiber  becomes  extremely  sick  for 
1D6 days as the poison is fought off, with most needing to 
be confined to bed. No doctor will find evidence of disease. 
During this period, STR and CON temporarily drop to 10—
the  victim  is  utterly  exhausted  and  suffers  from  terrifying 
hallucinations. Thereafter, the victim regains 1D10 points of 
STR and CON per day until fully recovered.

Crystal of the Elder Things 

Used by: Elder things
Large crystalline storage containers constructed to harness 
the  power  needed  to  bind  shoggoths  to  elder  thing  will. 
These crystals store magic points. The smallest shards might 
store 5 magic points and the largest 100. A caster can draw 
some or all of the magic points from a crystal while casting 
a spell. 

When  empty  these  crystals  are  room 
temperature,  but  they  become  colder  as 
more magic points are stored in them.

To  access  the  magic  points  stored  the 

user  must  become  attuned  to  the  spe-
cific  crystal.  There  must  be  physical 
contact and the user must spend 1D6 
rounds  attuning  to  the  vibrations  of 
the crystal. On the final round a POW 
roll  must  be  made.  With  success  the 
user can draw upon the magic points 
within as needed. Note that only elder 
things have the ability and understand-
ing to invest crystals with further magic 
points.

chapter 13: artifacts and alien devicesCrystallizer of Dreams

Used by: Anyone
Looking  like  a  large,  yellowish  egg,  the  crystallizer  is  used 
to view places faraway (distant lands, planets, and perhaps 
dimensions) in dreams.

A second, purported, function of this artifact is the abili-
ty it bestows upon its user to bring items (or even creatures) 
back with them from the Dreamlands. Presumably the user 
must have the item or creature in physical contact with them 
for this to be successful. 

Myths surround this unique device and tell that the user 
should beware lest they fall foul of the guardian of the crys-
tallizer—a servant of Hypnos that appears like a translucent 
jellyfish.

Domination Serum 

Used by: Serpent people
A colorless serum with the faintest taste of raspberries. No 
more than ten drops are required for full effect. If a Hard 
Con  roll  is  failed  the  target  becomes  very  suggestible,  but 
only to serpent people. Something in their peculiar smell or 
the specific intonation of their voices is the key to this sug-
gestibility.  The  victim  will  do  almost  anything  for  serpent 
people, short of endangering his or her own life or the lives 
of loved ones. 

The serum metabolizes slowly, taking 1D10+10 days for 
a victim to be free of its effects, provided no more is imbibed 
in the meantime.

Earthquake Mining Machine 

Used by: Mi-go
A massive cube measuring twenty feet on a side. The sides are 
covered with small, irregularly spaced convex windows of a 
cloudy, glasslike substance. When the device is made active it 
can be adjusted to pull a deeply buried stratum up through 

intervening layers of rock. The machine can reach down four 
to five miles and can affect an area up to one cubic mile in 
area at a time. However, the machine has the unfortunate side 
effect of causing earthquakes when it is used.

The size and depth of the area affected are directly cor-
related to the magnitude of the earthquake. For this reason 
mi-go tend to use such machines only in largely uninhabited 
areas, to avoid detection. A human unfamiliar with mi-go 
technology  would  be  unlikely  to  be  able  to  use  the  earth-
quake mining machine, except perhaps accidentally.

Electric Gun 

Used by: Mi-go
This  weapon  looks  like  a  warty,  doorknob-sized  lump  of 
black  metal,  covered  in  tiny  wires.  Mi-go  fire  this  weapon 
by clutching it tightly and changing the electrical resistance 
of the lump. 

When activated, the weapon fires a bluish bolt of sparks, 
causing 1D10 points of damage to the target. When it hits, 
the  electric  jolt  acts  like  a  taser,  causing  violent  muscle 
spasms that immobilize the victim for a number of rounds 
equal  to  the  damage  inflicted.  The  target  must  make  a 
CON  roll  or  fall  unconscious  for  1D6  rounds—if  the  roll 
is fumbled the target suffers cardiac arrest and dies, unless 
immediate medical intervention is received. 

Mi-go take normal rolled damage (surface burns to the 
carapace)  from  these  weapons,  but  do  not  have  electrical 
nervous systems and are immune to the other possible ef-
fects of damage from the electrical charges.

To be able to fire this alien weapon humans must realign 
the wires on the electric gun, a feat requiring a Hard Electrical 
Repair roll. So jury-rigged for human use, the weapon fires 
uncertainly.  Roll  1D6  when  attempting  to  fire:  the  weapon 
fires  only  on  a  result  of  1–2.  The  base  chance  for  a  human 
attacking with the Firearms (Electric Gun) skill is 10%.

Call of CthulhuGlass from Leng 
 …a great round window of a most curious clouded glass, of 
which [Wilbur] said only that it was a work of great antiqui-
ty, which he had discovered and acquired in the course of his 
travels in Asia. He referred to it at one time as “the glass from 
Leng” and at another as “possibly Hyadean in origin”, neither 
of which enlightened me in the slightest.

—August Derleth and H.P. Lovecraft, The Gable Window

Used by: Anyone
This magical arcane glass allows the possessor to see random 
visions of other places. The owner inscribes a pentagram in 
red chalk (presumably for protection), recites a brief verse 
and then the glass shows a scene of beings from the Cthulhu 
Mythos. Unfortunately, such beings can also see through the 
glass to the user’s side. The choice of scene viewed is not of 
the user’s choice and appears randomly.

The  spell  used  to  enchant  the  glass  is  long  forgotten, 
although rumors persist that a certain odd fellow who lives 
in Carcosa will impart the spell if a bargain can be reached.

The Moon Lens
Within Goatswood, in the Severn  
Valley of England, resides an artifact 
known as the moon lens. Built by  
worshippers of Shub-Niggurath, the lens 
acts to concentrate a beam of moonlight 
and so aid in the summoning of the Dark 
Mother with a Thousand Young at the 
full moon (instead of the dark of the 
moon as normally required).

Researchers of the occult suggest 
that the moon lens is actually a glass 
from Leng specifically tuned to the  
vibrations and space wherein  
Shub-Niggurath dwells. If so, then it 
would effectively provide the god with a 
direct semi-permanent portal or gateway 
to the Earth.

Great White Space, The

Used by: Elder things
A strange other dimension. It is unknown if the elder things 
actually created this dimension; however there is no doubt 
that they actively exploited it. It connects places light years 
apart and is or was used by the elder things to traverse the 
universe.  The  elder  things  created  at  least  one  portal  to 
the Great White Space on Earth, deep in the mountains of 
China; whether more portals exist remains to be discovered.

Elder Things
A billion years ago elder things descended 
upon Earth from the stars, their  
technology hundreds of years advanced 
beyond what humans know in the early 
twenty-first century. They were able to 
create life with their understanding of 
science—according to some, they were the 
creators of all life on Earth. However, 
as the aeons progressed, the elder things 
degenerated. They lost both their  
greatest technologies and their ability to 
fly through space unaided. Despite  
colonizing the entire planet, as the ages 
passed their hold diminished until they 
controlled only one city. In the end they 
barely had the technology to create  
artificial heaters, and so preserve their 
existence a few centuries more.

Thus, while it is known that the elder 
things once had great technology, and while 
it is believed that there are still elder 
things among the stars and that they still 
remember their ancient secrets, the elder 
things of Earth left almost no traces of 
their technological mastery.

If the Great White Space was a dimension constructed 
by  the  elder  things,  it  is  reasonable  to  presume  that  other 
pocket  dimensions  may  have  also  been  created.  Probably 
varying  in  size  and  secretly  existing  until  discovered  by 
some  hapless  traveller  or  sorcerer,  who  knows  what  such 
spaces would hold? 

Lamp of Alhazred
The lamp of Alhazred was unusual in its appearance. It was 
meant for burning oil, and seemed to be of gold. It had the 
shape of a small oblong pot, with a handle curved up from 
one side, and a spout for wick and flame on the other. Many 
curious drawings decorated it, together with letters and 
pictures arranged into words in a language unfamiliar.
—August Derleth and H.P. Lovecraft, The Lamp of Alhazred

Used by: Anyone
An  enchanted  oil-burning  lamp.  When  lit,  the  lamp  gives 
forth vapors that send the minds of those who inhale them 
into ecstasies of vision. These revelations are of the strange 
and weird landscapes of Mythos places and dimensions, and 
the ways of the entities there. If this lamp were actually used 
by Al-Hazred, the author of the Al Azif, some of the breadth 
of his knowledge would be explained.

It is believed that the lamp is unique, however its where-

abouts today is unknown.

271 

chapter 13: artifacts and alien devicesYithians
Of all the known alien races, the 
Yithians are the most technologically 
advanced. However, perhaps due to the 
Yithians’ philosophical view of life, they 
are oddly reluctant to use their  
technology. They tend to be reactive, 
quickly and adeptly formulating new 
technology as it is required, but in 
general their curiosity does not drive 
them toward invention.
Of particular note is the Yithians’ 
conquest of time—the reason for their 
being called the Great Race. They are 
the only technical race able to move 
up and down the time stream at will. 
Somehow they even avoid the dreaded 
hounds of Tindalos, who pursue many 
others who traverse time and attract 
their attention.
Although the Yithians’ temporal 
abilities are largely mental, they have 
also invented devices that affect the 
fourth dimension.

Lightning Gun 

Used by: Yithians
A rare Yithian weapon, this device was created by the race 
shortly  after  their  arrival  on  prehistoric  Earth.  Built  to 
combat the carnivorous flying polyps, it is a camera-shaped 
weapon that fires great gouts of electricity. 

Numerous varieties exist. A common one contains a pack 
of  32  charges  and  takes  1  round  to  reload.  Multiple  charges 
may be fired at once, though each charge used above four at 
one time gives a 5% cumulative chance of burning out the gun. 
Each charge does 1D10 damage to the target of the weapon. 

Lightning Gun

Base  range  is  100  yards.  For  each  additional  100  yards 
add one penalty to the attack roll and decrease the damage 
roll result by 3. At point-blank range add one bonus die to 
the attack roll.

An investigator can figure out how to use this weapon 
with  a  successful  INT  roll.  The  base  chance  for  a  human 
attacking with the Firearms (Lightning Gun) skill is 10%.

Mist Projector 

Used by: Mi-go
A  device  looking  like  a  cluster  of  twisted  metal  tubes  that 
projects  a  cone  of  icy  mist  in  a  fat  cloud  about  ten  feet 

Mist Projector

272 

Call of CthulhuFlying polyps
The malicious flying polyps  
colonized Earth aeons ago, 
apparently after flying to Earth 
on their own power. The flying 
polyps built great basalt  
cities—the very ones they were 
later sealed in—but there is no 
other evidence of their  
technology. It is assumed that it 
is at least at the level of  
humanity’s during the late Middle 
Ages.

across. The mist looks like thick white fog and is intensely 
cold.  The  mist  does  1D10  points  of  damage  per  round  of 
exposure, less one point if the targets are dressed in warm 
clothing  or  three  points  for  thick,  arctic  clothing.  Hiding 
inside a car affords four points of protection; however the 
mist freezes automobile engines, running or not, and the car 
will not start or restart until it warms up. The weapon’s pro-
jection can be sustained—mi-go generally spray mist over a 
target for several rounds, ensuring the death of unprotected 
humans.

An investigator can figure out how to use this weapon 
with  a  successful  INT  roll.  Because  the  mist  travels  much 
more slowly than a bullet, investigators who have seen mist 
projectors  in  action  and  who  have  freedom  of  movement 
(i.e. they are not caught in an enclosed space), can dodge the 
slow-moving mist streams with a successful DEX roll. 

The weapons carry enough charge for twenty shots, each 

potentially lasting an entire combat round. 

Plutonian Drug

I have here five pellets of the drug Liao. It was used by the 
Chinese philosopher Lao Tze, and while under its influence he 
visioned Tao. Tao is the most mysterious force in the world; it 
surrounds and pervades all things

—Frank Belknap Long, The Hounds of Tindalos

Used by: Anyone
This drug can send the user’s mind back in time, sometimes 
so far back that the user may even encounter the hounds of 
Tindalos (page 298)—entities capable of traveling up and 
down time via its "corners". 

Those taking the drug must make a Sanity roll or lose 
1D8  sanity  points;  however  if  they  come  across  Mythos 
entities on their journey back in time they are subject to 
the standard sanity losses for viewing those entities. Taking 
the plutonian drug and witnessing the true history of the 
universe  and  planet  Earth  provides  the  user  with  1D6 
Cthulhu Mythos points.

The drug can appear in liquid or tablet form and its 
manufacture  is  hinted  at  within  certain  Mythos  tomes, 
including the Book of Eibon (page 226).

Insects from   
Shaggai 

The technology of the shan seems 
most like that of the mi-go—it has been 
predominantly turned toward the dark 
science of the Mythos Gods. They fly 
through space in great pyramidal space 
ships; at the center of each of these 
craft is a ‘nuclear reactor’—which is 
thought to be a portion or dimensional 
portal to Azathoth. Weaponry is a  
particular area of shan advancement. 
Their cruel nervewhip is just one of the 
many weapons they have designed.

Shining Trapezohedron
[it was] a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron with many 
irregular flat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of 
some sort, or an artificial object of carved and highly polished 
mineral matter. It did not touch the bottom of the box, but 
was held suspended by means of a metal band around its 
center, with seven queerly-designed supports extending 
horizontally to angles of the box’s inner wall near the top…
exposed, [Blake] could scarcely tear his eyes from it, and as 
he looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was 
transparent, with half-formed worlds of wonder within.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Haunter of the Dark

The Cult of   
Starry Wisdom
The last recorded owners of the  
Shining Trapezohedron were a New 
England sect, known as the Starry 
Wisdom. Members purportedly held the 
artifact within a church in Providence, 
Rhode Island, between 1844 and 1877. 
The cult mysteriously dissolved and 
there is no further mention of them 
until 1934, when a doctor is reported to 
have thrown the box and jewel into the 
deepest channel of Narragansett Bay 
after reading the diary of local artist 
Robert Blake.

Rumors persist that the cult 
remains active, although nowadays it 
exists wholly underground and out of 
the public eye. The validity of tales 
of fishing boats seen late at night in 
Narragansett Bay remains unproven.

chapter 13: artifacts and alien devicesUsed by: Cultists of Nyarlathotep
A  peculiar  metal  box  in  which  is  mounted  a  stone  about 
four inches thick. It rewards or damns those who look into it 
with visions of other worlds and dimensions—thus the stone 
shines with the interior light of things not of our world. 

When the box is closed (enclosing the gem in total dark-
ness), a hideous avatar of Nyarlathotep comes, known as the 
Haunter of the Dark since it abhors light—it will not enter 
any space where light is present, not even the pale circles of 
light cast by street lamps.

The stone exercises great command over human psyches 
and is believed to be used by worshippers of Nyarlathotep. 
This  artifact  is  ancient,  predating  humanity  and  possibly 
manufactured by the mi-go on Yuggoth. 

Serpent People
Many serpent people kingdoms were founded on 
sorcery and alchemy; however, there is at least 
one which originated deep below the Earth in 
Yoth and then migrated to Hyperborea, and which 
raised science to new levels. It is believed that 
these serpent people were at least as advanced as 
the humans of the late twentieth century, but in 
the science of biology they far excelled.

The serpent people of Yoth were able to 
manipulate life forms as they desired. It is  
believed that both ghasts and the voormis are 
their creations, each bred to carry out certain 
tasks for their ophidian masters. Not only could 
the serpent people adjust the genetic structure 
of a creature in its prenatal state, so it changed 
as it grew, but they also developed serums which 
could evoke the most remarkable transformations 
in fully grown specimens. Cloning and accelerated 
growth were also well within the serpent  
people’s ability.

Another particular area of serpent people 

interest was the creation of various poisons and 
toxins. Some killed, while others simply induced 
sleep. Some acted quickly, while others might 
take a century to take full effect. Some were 
blatantly obvious—causing fear—while others were 
incredibly subtle. No other race has come close 
to approaching the level of knowledge of poisons 
enjoyed by the serpent people.

The later Hyperborean civilization of the  
serpent people, which preserved many of the 
secrets of Yoth, fell almost a million years ago 
and since then the technology of the serpent 
people has almost utterly disappeared. Some 
modern serpent people strive to regain their lost 
technology, but they are few.

Star Stone of Mnar

Star Stones of Mnar

Used by: Anyone
Usually  found  in  the  same  location  as  the  supposed 
tombs  of  ancient  evil  beings.  Best  described  as 
green-colored  disk-shaped  (sometimes  star-shaped) 
rocks on which is carved an Elder Sign (page 255).

The stones are alleged to come from the fabled land 
of Mnar in prehistory, although some occult scholars 
suggest that this is a mere tale and that the stones are 
extraterrestrial  in  origin  and  were  perhaps  fashioned 
by the Elder Gods themselves. Either way, a star stone is 
believed to ward the bearer against the minions of the 
Great Old Ones, granting safe passage in dark places. 
Note that the protection only extends to the minions 
of Great Old Ones, not the Great Old Ones themselves!
Wise  folk  state  that  the  stones  are  blighted  and 
that  anyone  removing  a  star  stone  from  its  proper 
place will suffer an elder curse. Presumably the Elder 
Gods do not wish the stones to be removed from the 
prison-tombs of the Great Old Ones, as doing so might 
weaken the magicks in force and allow the imprisoned 
god to break free.

Stasis Cube 

Used by: Yithians
These devices appear in a number of different shapes 
and  sizes,  however  they  all  have  a  single  purpose:  to 
slow the flow of time. Older cubes give ratios of 1-sec-
ond internal time per thousand years external time, but 
in the future the Yithians will advance this to 1-second 
internal time per million years external time. 

The smallest stasis cubes were used to store books 
in Pnakotus. Larger stasis cubes have been used to fling 
Yithians  into  the  future.  Almost  all  stasis  cubes  are 
simple in design, made from metal or plastic with no 
sign of external circuitry.

Call of CthulhuPnakotus
A million years ago the Great 
Race constructed the city of 
Pnakotus somewhere in the 
Australian desert. Scholars 
suggest that its name  
translates as ‘city of  
archives’ and it is believed 
to be a mighty repository of 
knowledge.

Pushing  a  button  or  opening  up  the  stasis  cube  deacti-
vates  most  stasis  cubes,  but  some  have  complicated  panels 
allowing  the  programming  of  set  periods  of  stasis.  These 
more complicated devices would likely be incomprehensible 
to someone who did not understand Yithian technology, but 
anyone could use the simpler ones, perhaps even by accident.

Deep ones

The technology of the deep ones is 
almost unrecognizable to humans.  
Beyond basic Stone Age constructs, 
most of the technology of the deep 
ones is organic in form. It is believed 
that they discovered the basis of their 
organic technology when they first allied 
with the shoggoths and discovered how 
the elder things had made those  
creatures and how they could be  
controlled. In the modern world, deep 
one cities are not as much constructed 
as grown. On occasion other useful 
tools are grown as well. Technology 
does not influence deep one society 
nearly as much as it does humanity’s, 
but it is still an important force. 

Tabula Rasa Device 

Temporal Communicator 

Used by: Yithians
A device invented by the Yithians to erase the memories of 
those entities they displace through time. It is a small, slim, 
rectangular copper box covered with tiny indentations. From 
one side of the box, five flexible metal tubes extend, ending 
in  inch-long  metal  needles.  The  needles  are  inserted  into 
the victim’s head, which takes five rounds. Once the device 
is activated, the victim is paralyzed unless he or she makes a 
successful POW roll each round that the device is connected.
Each  round  the  machine  erases  up  to  a  year’s  worth 
of memories or removes 5 points of INT, at the operator’s 
discretion. These memories and thoughts are stored in the 
copper box. The erasure of memories is not always totally 
complete.  Every  year  there  is  an  INT  chance  that  some 
memory returns in the form of dreams. The function of this 
device may also be reversed, feeding the stored memories to 
the original victim or alternatively to 

another entity entirely. 

The  tabula  rasa  device  is 
very  complex,  and  can  only 
be used by those familiar with 
Yithian  technology.  Humans 
ignorant of Yithian technolo-
gy would require an Extreme 
INT roll to successful operate 
the  device—failure  would 
indicate  that  the  person 
connected  to  the  machine 
has  suffered  brain  damage 
and the loss of 1D100 INT.

Used by: Yithians
These  devices  are  sometimes  supplied  to  human  agents 
of  the Yithians. When  assembled,  the  device  stands  nearly 
a foot tall. It is made of bronze and covered with intricate 
carvings. A red jewel, attuned to a specific Yithian, is embed-
ded into the top of the machine.

When  power  is  switched  on,  the 

jewel begins to glow red. After a few 
minutes,  contact  is  established 
with the Yithian attuned to the 
jewel. The Yithian may be any 
distance in time or space. A 
hologram  is  projected  and 
the Yithian can see into the 
time and space occupied by 
the  machine  and  thus  may 
communicate  with  those 
who have contacted it. 

A  Yithian 
temporal 
fairly 
communicator 
is 
straightforward  to  operate, 
provided  that  an  investi-
gator  can  understand  and 
determine  which  carving 
turns it on.

chapter 13: artifacts and alien deviceshis  chapter  provides  a  selection  of  monsters, 
beasts, and alien beings for use within Call of 
Cthulhu. The chapter is divided into four sec-
tions, each focusing on a specific monster type: 
Cthulhu  Mythos  entities,  Cthulhu  Mythos 
gods, classic monsters, and beasts. The selection of monsters 
across the sections is not exhaustive—every horror fan can 
probably think of some terror not present. The ones here are 
those  found  in  the  most  important  stories,  frequently  ap-
pear in scenarios, or are commonly referred to. Many more 
can  be  found  in  the  Call  of  Cthulhu  supplement  Malleus 
Monstrorum, also from Chaosium.

About the Entries
Most  monsters  and  entities  have  characteristics  including 
STR, CON, SIZ, POW, INT, and DEX. However many do not 
have an APP or EDU, since these qualities are meaningless 
in such alien and horrific creatures. Keepers have full reign 
to alter, modify, and rethink these entries. Lovecraft did not 
codify the monsters in his stories, so neither should you if 
you wish to present dramatically different versions.

These are creatures of nightmare, and individual mon-
sters may vary from one encounter to the next in their char-
acteristics  and  abilities.  The  characteristic  values  given  for 
each monster are those of an average specimen. As Keeper, 
you have the option to roll an individual monster’s statistics, 
or  choose  to  create  a  lesser  or  greater  specimen  using  the 
dice ranges as a guide to generating characteristic values.

Size Comparison 
Charts
The diagrams below illustrate 
various denizens of the Cthulhu 
Mythos, providing some idea of 
the relative size of these  
creatures. Note the various 
unfortunate investigators  
splattered about the monsters. 
Some of these creatures,  
notably Cthulhu, are able to 
alter their mass and size at will; 
the illustration shows only one 
version of such images.

Only full characteristic values (i.e. no halves and fifths) 
are listed for monsters. Non-player character and monster 
characteristics are primarily used to set  the difficulty  level 
of players’ skill rolls. As Keeper, you may occasionally need 
to figure out one-half or one-fifth of a particular monster’s 
characteristic value, but this will be unusual.

Monster Sizes
Certain  monsters  are  staggeringly  huge  when  compared  to 
the human scale, just take a look at the diagram below!

278 

Call of CthulhuBuilds
Along  with  the  characteristic  of  SIZ, 
each monster, character, and vehicle has 
a build value. This figure provides an at 
a glance guide to scale. The average hu-
man has a Build of 0, with the full range 
extending from –2 (children and small 
persons)  to  2  (heavyweight  boxers  for 
example). The build scale is not linear; 
combining  5  motorcycles  would  not 
create something larger than a truck. 

When considering what a being can 
lift or throw, use a standard human as 
a guide. The average human of Build 0 
could lift someone of equal build off the 
floor, perhaps carrying them over their 
shoulder. Something of 1 build smaller 
could  easily  be  lifted,  and  a  thing  of  2 
builds smaller could be thrown. With a 
strain, a human of Build 0 might just lift 
a person of Build 1. The most a person 
of Build 0 might do to a person of Build 
2 is to unbalance them or disarm them.
Using  this  as  a  guide,  it  becomes 
simple  to  figure  the  relative  capability 
of a monster to lift and throw things—
for example, whether a monster is large 
enough to throw a car.

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsQuick-reference Build comparison:

i  If a target is 2 builds smaller: it can be thrown.
i  If a target is 1 build smaller: it can be lifted with ease.
i  If a target is of equal build: it can be carried for a 

short time.

i  If a target is 1 build larger: it can barely be lifted.
i  If a target is 2 builds larger: it cannot be lifted, but 

might be unbalanced or disarmed.

Hidden. Keepers should add skills as required, using com-
parative beings as a guide.

Mythos  gods  and  some  Mythos  monsters  are  multidi-
mensional, existing in our plane of reality as well as others 
beyond our reasoning, and thus cannot be truly slain. While 
hit points are given, should such a creature as an Outer God 
or  Great  Old  One  be  somehow  reduced  to  0  or  negative 
hit points, the thing is not killed or rendered unconscious, 
but is dispelled or forced back from whence it came. Mere 
damage will not destroy or even harm these powers. If they 
are forced or persuaded to leave, they can return.

Playing Monsters  
Effectively
Monsters are, for the most part, not mindless animals. Many 
are of equal or greater intelligence than the investigators, with 
motivations  and  concerns  beyond  the  scope  of  the  average 
human’s understanding. Monsters will not automatically seek 
combat and, if they do, they will not necessarily seek to kill 
the investigators. The more intelligent monsters may take the 
investigators  captive,  either  to  use  as  slaves  or  sacrifices,  or 
perhaps for experimental purposes. Not every encounter has 
to be a fight; hiding or fleeing may be the wisest option.

When involved in combat, consider the monster’s objec-
tive. If its aim is to kill the investigator, it should fight back 
rather than dodge. If it wants to escape from the investigators, 
it may choose to dodge in order to gain an opportunity to flee. 
Many Mythos monsters can use spells, casting them as any 
other spell caster would. In some cases a monster’s spell may be 
portrayed as a manifestation of that monster’s innate power. 

Monsters  may  not  have  skills  listed,  though  most  or 
all  might  have  a  few  skills  such  as  Listen,  Stealth,  or  Spot 

Monsters and Investigators— 
a Comparison
It is quite possible for the investigators to beat some monsters 
in combat. Against others, their only chance of survival is gen-
erally to flee or hide. Deep ones, byakhees, dimensional sham-
blers, fire vampires, ghasts, ghouls, servants of Gla'aki, mi-go, 
moon-beasts,  nightgaunts,  rat-things,  sand-dwellers,  serpent 
people, insects from Shagghai, tcho-tcho, and of course human 
cultists can all be "taken on" in combat by several investigators 
with  some  hope  of  success.  This  is  the  reason  that  so  many 
scenarios feature cultists, deep ones, mi-go, and ghouls—they 
make  approximately  human-scale  adversaries.  Such  Mythos 
entities can, on first reflection, appear human-like in terms of 
their vulnerability and relative size; yet beware of humanizing 
such monsters. As stated, their goals, knowledge, and abilities 
should be difficult, if not impossible, to fathom. They will act in 
unexpected ways and the mere sight of them can draw madness 
down upon the inquisitive investigator.

Combat
By default, every monster (with a few exceptions), has the 
Fighting skill—a generic combat skill covering all manner 
of strikes, kicks, claws, teeth, tentacles, elbows, head butts, 
etc. If the being is able to use melee weapons, the Fighting 
skill should be used for those as well. Be creative in how you 
use and portray these attacks. Each entry describes how the 
monster would normally attack, and key words, such as bite 
or kick, are provided to give Keepers ideas on how best to 
describe differing attacks. The environment can also be add-
ed to the description of attacks and damage: an investigator 
could be crushed between an elephant and a tree; a ghoul 
could crack open an investigator’s head against a gravestone; 
and so on. 

While a monster’s standard attack could be used every time, 
this can become repetitive and dull. Using the damage listed for 
the monster’s standard Fighting attack frees the Keeper from 
having to adjust the damage with each variation, allowing the 
Keeper  greater  freedom  to  describe  the  monster’s  attacks  in 
creative and imaginative ways. The Keeper is neither gaining an 
advantage or disadvantage in varying the monster’s attacks—
he or she is making the story more exciting and engaging.

A deep one has the following attack listed:
Fighting 45% (22/9), damage 1D6 + damage bonus (1D4)
Using  this  skill,  the  Keeper  could  describe  a  suc-
cessful attack in any of the following ways. Regardless 
of the manner of attack, for ease of play, the same 1D6 
+ 1D4 damage is dealt.

i  The deep one rakes its claws across Harvey’s 

chest, slicing through his clothes.

i  The deep one charges into Harvey, body-slam-

ming him.

i  Kicking out backwards like a horse, the deep 
one slams its foot into Harvey’s midriff.
i  The deep one grabs Harvey’s jacket, thrusting 
Harvey’s  head  into  the  crumbling  plaster  of 
the wall in the Gilman House Hotel.

Monsters and Maneuvers
Maneuvers  (mnvr)  use  the  monster’s  Fighting  skill.  Build 
is an important factor for maneuvers; if the opponent is 3 
Build points above that of an attacker, a maneuver is ineffec-
tive. Any monster of Build 2 or greater is never going to have 
penalty dice when using a maneuver against a human being. 
The largest opponent a human (maximum Build 2) could 
take  on  with  a  maneuver  would  be  Build  4  (horse,  elder 
thing, etc.)—even then, the largest of humans would attack 
with 2 penalty dice due to the difference in Build. 

In combat, monsters can use the same range of maneu-
vers open to humans. The Keeper should visualize the mon-

A  dark  young  is  fighting  a  group  of  investigators. 
The dark young may initiate five separate attacks on 
its  turn  in  the  DEX  order,  one  of  which  may  be  its 
trample attack. 

First  attack:  The  dark  young  raises  one  of  its 
many hooves to stamp on a hapless investigator. The 
investigator’s player rolls a failure on the attempt to 
dodge  the  attack,  while  the  Keeper  rolls  a  Regular 
success  on  the  dark  young’s  Fighting  skill,  and  deals 
damage equal to damage bonus (4D6), for 11 damage. 
Second attack: This  time  the  dark  young  lashes 
out with a tentacle to attempt to grasp an investiga-
tor. This uses a fighting maneuver; of course the dark 
young  has  a  larger  build  than  any  investigator,  so 
does not take any penalty dice on the maneuver. The 
Keeper rolls an Extreme success. The investigator fails 
to dodge and is seized and lifted high in the air, being 
drained of 12 points of Strength. The dark young will 
keep the investigator held until the poor unfortunate 
has been completely drained.

Third attack: Two of the investigators are getting 
into  their  pickup  truck.  Remember  that  the  dark 
young has an INT of 70, as much as most investiga-
tors,  so  it  may  well  know  what  a  pickup  truck  is.  It 
uses its trample attack on the pickup. At present, the 
vehicle is static and so the Keeper allows an automatic 
success, but makes the attack roll in case of a fumble 
or Extreme success. The attack would normally have 
failed but was not a fumble, so in this case the attack 
against  a  stationary  object  is  successful.  This  deals 
(6D6)  17  damage.  Each  10  full  points  of  damage 
reduces the build of a vehicle by 1 point. 

Fourth attack: Annoyed at how tough the pickup 
truck proved to be, the Keeper decides that the dark 
young will attempt to flip the vehicle. The pickup has 
a build of 6 (it has 1 point of damage, but its listed 
build is still 6), 1 higher than the dark young’s build; 
the  dark  young  can  use  its  fighting  maneuver  but 
must apply 1 penalty die. Again, the car is not moving 
so unless the Keeper rolls a fumble, the attack will be 
successful. The Keeper rolls 24 or 14 (with the penalty 
die)  which,  taking  the  higher  roll,  still  gives  a  Hard 
success. Builds (see page 33) states that a being is just 
able  to  lift  something  that  is  of  1  build  larger  than 
itself. The dark young manages to tip the pickup truck 
over onto its side, with a crash.

For its final attack the dark young simply lashes 
out with a kick at a nearby investigator, and the Keep-
er rolls a Hard success. The player rolls a Hard success 
to dodge, so the investigator avoids the blow.

ster and imagine how it might take advantage of its physical 
form in combat. If it has tentacles, hands, or pincers, it might 
seize hold of its opponent. If it has a prominent mouth then 
it might bite and hold onto its prey. Large creatures might 
simply  trap  their  opponents  with  their  bulk,  crushing  the 
life out of them. Opponents that are seized or grabbed are 

281 

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsheld until they succeed in an opposed STR roll or maneuver 
of their own to free themselves.

With a successful maneuver, a monster could:
i  Knock an investigator to the floor, gaining a bonus 
die on its next attack if the investigator is still prone.
i  Push an investigator out of a window or over a cliff.
i  Disarm  an  investigator,  knocking  that  annoying 

"boom-stick" out of his or her hands.

i  Grasp hold of an investigator with a tentacle, gain-
ing  a  bonus  die  to  cause  harm  by  constriction  or 
pummeling  the  held  investigator  against  a  wall  on 
the next attack.

i  If  the  monster  is  large  enough,  it  could  seize  an 
investigator  and  carry  him  or  her  off  next  round, 
perhaps flying away or carrying the held investiga-
tor aloft with a writhing tentacle.

i  A  standard  car  has  Build  5,  so  any  monster  with 
Build  3+  has  the  potential  to  damage  vehicles. 
Larger monsters might even seize hold of a vehicle 
containing  the  investigators,  much  like  an  angry 
child throwing a cereal box.

Monsters and Fighting Back
Unless a monster is trying to escape or being especially crafty, 
you should respond to investigator attacks by fighting back 
rather than dodging. When fighting back, a monster should 
generally use its basic Fighting skill. A monster that has more 
than one attack per round may also dodge or fight back that 
number of times before its enemies are granted a bonus die 
for outnumbering it (see Outnumbered, page 108). Thus a 
ghoul  with  three  attacks  can  fight  back  three  times  before 
its attackers gain a bonus die to their attacks. Some Mythos 
entities can never be outnumbered by investigators.

Killing Monsters
Rather than declaring that a monster or opponent is dead, 
the Keeper is encouraged to describe what the investigators 
can see—the monster has stopped moving, it appears to be 
melting, a thick green fluid is welling up from a hole in the 
side of its body, and so on. Remember that these monsters 
are strange and alien beings; determining death should not 
be simple. Some monsters (when reduced to unconscious-
ness or zero hit points) may appear to be dead, only to rise 
again moments or hours later to inflict a grisly revenge on 
their attackers. Only a successful First Aid or Medicine roll 
will determine for sure whether a being is alive or dead.

Monster Spells
The higher a monster’s POW and INT, the more likely it is 
to know spells. As a guide, those with POW and INT of 50 
to 100 might know 1D6 spells. In choosing spells, consider 
the  purpose  and  the  nature  of  the  creature.  Keepers  are 
encouraged to manipulate and alter spells to better suit par-
ticular Mythos monsters. No casting roll is required for the 
initial casting of a spell by a monster. Expend magic points 
as required by the spell cost, but disregard any SAN costs or 
Sanity rolls. 

Suitable spells for each monster are suggested, although 

others may be known if the Keeper wishes.

In many cases, the Mythos monsters described here wor-
ship one or more of the Outer Gods or Great Old Ones, and it 
should be assumed that they would know at least one spell to 
contact, call, or summon their masters. 

Chapter 13: Grimoire details many suitable spells, howev-
er Keepers are encouraged to adjust spells and use the deeper 
magic versions; after all, these beings are not some fumbling 
human wizard seeking the mysteries of magic, but rather the 
very embodiment of the Mythos in all of its horrific splendor. 

Section One:  
Mythos Monsters
This  section  details  the  abominations  of  the  Cthulhu 
Mythos—creatures  of  this  world  and  from  beyond.  The 
monsters  described  here  are,  in  the  main,  repugnant  to 
humanity in their visage and aspect, being a threat to both 
an investigator’s mind and body.

Keepers  are  reminded  that  these  embodiments  of  the 
Mythos  are  not  uniform  in  their  appearance,  and  distinc-
tions can be made between creatures of the same race. 

When portraying a Mythos monster, the Keeper should 
avoid only illustrating the visual aspect to the players. Smell 
and sound are important signifiers, so too is the otherworld-
ly  atmosphere  such  creatures  create.  As  the  Necronomicon 
states, “…as a foulness shall ye shall know Them.” 

Byakhee

There flapped rhythmically a horde of tame, trained, 
hybrid winged things…not altogether crows, nor moles, 
nor buzzards, nor ants, nor decomposed human beings, but 
something I cannot and must not recall.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Festival

This  interstellar  race  often  serves  Hastur  the  Unnamable, 
and may be summoned to partake in rituals. Composed of 
conventional matter, they are vulnerable to ordinary weap-
ons, such as pistols. 

Dwelling in interstellar space, byakhee do not have bases 
on  Earth,  but  may  be  summoned  to  perform  deeds  or  to 
serve as steeds, carrying riders through interstellar space.

Fly: Byakhee can fly through space and carry a rider; though 
such riders need protection from the vacuum and cold by 
suitable spells or potions (e.g. Space-Mead). 

Spells: Byakhee have a 40% chance of knowing 1D4 spells. 
Such spells may relate to Hastur and associated beings.

Byakhee

Bite  and  hold  (mnvr): 
If  the  bite  strikes 
home  the  byakhee 
remains attached to the victim and begins to drain his or her 
blood.  Each  round  the  byakhee  remains  attached,  including 
the first, the blood drain subtracts 3D10 points of STR from 
the victim, until death occurs (at STR 0). The byakhee char-
acteristically remains attached with this attack until the victim 
is  drained  of  blood,  unless  the  victim  can  make  a  successful 
opposed STR roll. Escaping death, let the victim rest and regain 
blood (by transfusion as well), at up to 1D10+5 STR per day. A 
Byakhee may hold only one victim at a time.

Do  byakhee  possess  the  ability  to  fold  space?  Some 
conjecture  that  this  power  manifests  via  a  certain 
internal organ, sometimes known as a "hune." There 
are some who would find great interest in the potential 
applications such an organ could have as a weapon or 
method of transport.

Perhaps  a specimen of this organ resides in some 
forgotten  museum  or  laboratory,  just  waiting  for  an 
unwitting scientist to activate its terrible secrets.

Chthonians

Flowing tentacles and pulpy gray-black, elongated sack of 
a body… no distinguishing features at all other than the 
reaching, groping tentacles. Or was there—yes—a lump in 
the upper body of the thing… a container of sorts for the 
brain, ganglia, or whichever diseased organ governed this 
horror’s loathsome life!
—Brian Lumley, The Burrowers Beneath

These  creatures  are  like  immense  earth-bound  squids,  and 
their  elongated  wormlike  bodies  are  coated  with  slime.  A 
chanting sound accompanies them. These powerful burrow-
ers live more than a thousand years, and are protective of their 
young. A jumble of remarkable properties, chthonians bear 
little resemblance to anything else on this planet. The most 
important individual chthonian is the gigantic Shudde M’ell.
All stages of chthonians communicate by telepathy and 
can thus reach another of their race anywhere in the world, 
and  can  sense  other  minds.  Only  adults  can  telepathically 
control members of other species with this power.

They can tunnel through rock as though it were butter 
and  have  no  need  to  breathe.  Adult  chthonians  can  with-
stand  enormous  temperatures,  up  to  4000°C  (7200°F).  It 
may be that the majority of chthonians live toward the core 
of this planet, and that only outcasts, wanderers, and those 
accidentally caught up in pluming magma explore the cold 
outer  crust  where  man  thrives.  Perhaps  they  migrate  here 
to  give  birth,  since  the  younger  stages  cannot  withstand 
extreme heat. We do not know their motives.

Full adults can cause powerful earthquakes.
Chthonians  are  extremely  susceptible  to  water.  While 
their  slime  coating  protects  them  from  small  amounts  of 
water, general immersion destroys a chthonian. Burrowing, 
these monsters detect significant water by distinguishing the 
relatively  low  echo  profiles  of  water  and  watery  sediment, 
avoiding such areas.

Chthonians are worldwide, even found in basalt under 
the oceans. In western Africa is a mystery city called G’harne, 
which they frequent. They may have been imprisoned there 
once, aeons ago.

The general discussion and initial statistics concern the 
full adult, the last and largest stage (instar) between molts. 
This is the sort which investigators are most likely to meet. A 
closing section compares all six stages, since a nest of young-
er chthonians may be encountered, or a band of chthonians 
with varying age groups could be met with.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Chthonian  telepathic  control:  Chthonians  can  use  te-
lepathy  to  control  humans,  though  they  do  not  often  do 
so unless the target has something they want, such as odd 
spherical mineral formations.

The target may attempt to resist a single chthonian with 
an  opposed  POW  roll.  Overcome,  the  victim  is  bound  to 
the  area  where  psychically  attacked.  At  first  the  target  has 
mobility  of  a  mile  or  so,  but  this  progressively  lessens  as 
the  chthonian  draws  nearer,  until  the  victim  may  not  be 

283 

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsable to leave a particular room, or even a particular chair. 
The target immobilized, the chthonian erupts through the 
floor and collects its due. If the victim becomes aware of the 
mental influence of a chthonian, the hold may be broken by 
successfully making a POW roll versus the chthonian. Once 
a victim has experience of chthonians, a successful INT roll 
constitutes awareness.

A chthonian can telepathically contact a known human 
anywhere on the Earth, but it may take time before it can 
locate its victim’s mind.

It costs a chthonian one magic point to communicate with 
a human or to bind a human to a site for a day. Each ten miles 
of  distance  from  a  binding  also  costs  another  magic  point. 
Several chthonians may contribute magic points to compen-
sate for distance, but the POW rolls are made individually.

It costs no magic points to contact another chthonian, 

no matter at what distance.

Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  adults  may  be  able  to 
drain  a  human’s  magic  points,  but  nothing  definite  is  truly 
known.

Earthquake attacks: All adult chthonians can create earth-
quakes. Figure an earthquake’s force by totaling the POW of 
participating chthonians and dividing by 100. The result is 
the earthquake’s magnitude on the Richter Scale, but only 
in  the  first  diameter  of  100  yards.  In  the  next  100  yards, 
the  Richter  force  is  lessened  by  one,  and  so  on  for  each 
additional 100 yards until the strength of the quake can be 
ignored. Alternatively, the chthonians might limit the force 
in the center diameter and instead extend the quake’s diam-
eter-of-effect or maximum effect by multiples of 100 yards.

At least half of the participants must be directly under 
the  center  of  the  earthquake.  Each  chthonian  must  spend 
magic  points  equal  to  the  highest  Richter  Scale  number 
generated  for  the  quake.  Historically,  the  highest  Richter 
numbers  have  been  approximately  nines,  but  geological 
evidence exists of quakes that have been much stronger.

Spells: A full adult has a 50% chance of knowing 1D6 spells, 
most  of  which  should  be  connected  with  Shudde  M’ell 
and  Great  Old  Ones  tied  to  this  earth,  such  as  Cthulhu, 
Y’Golonac, Yig, etc.

ATTACKS 
Attacks per round: 1D8. It may only use its crush attack once per 

round.

Fighting attacks: It’s dangerous to get near to these things. Their 
crushing bulk and flailing tentacles may strike at any moment.
Hold and Drain (mnvr): Each round, a chthonian can attack with 
1D8  tentacles,  each  of  which  cause  damage  equal  to  half  the 
creature’s  damage  bonus  (round  down).  If  a  tentacle  strikes 
home, it clings and worms its way into the victim’s vitals, and 
begins to drain off blood and fluids, costing 3D10 CON each 
round. Reaching 0 CON, the victim dies. CON lost to a chtho-
nian is gone for good. While a tentacle is draining a victim, it 
cannot be used to drain other targets, but it could still be used 
to  fight-back,  swinging  the  poor  held  victim  like  a  ball  on  a 
chain at its attacker. 

Tentacles  draining  their  targets  will  continue  to  sap  CON  each 
round.  Each  tentacle  could  attack  a  different  target  or  they 
could all attack the same one.

Crush: A chthonian may use its immense bulk to crush a foe. If 
crushing,  it  can  continue  to  hold  and  drain  victims  that  are 
already caught. The chthonian rears up and crashes down on 
a group: the crush area is circular, striking equally all within. 
The crush area equals a diameter in yards of the chthonian’s 
SIZ divided by fifty. Within the crush area, an investigator must 
succeed with DEX, Dodge, or Jump, or lose hit points equal to 
the creature’s full damage bonus.

Chthonian

Near invulnerable, the weaknesses of Cthonians have 
been explored by only a few (mad) wizards. Purported 
vulnerabilities include the Vach-Viraj Chant, the Elder 
Sign, and total immersion in a body of water.

Call of CthulhuColours Out of Space
The shaft of phosphorescence from the well brought a sense of 
doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their 
conscious minds could form. It was no longer shining out, it 
was pouring out; and as the shapeless stream of unplaceable 
colour left the well it seemed to flow directly into the sky.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour Out of Space

A colour is a sentient organism that manifests as pure co-
lour—it is not gaseous, it is insubstantial. When it moves, 
it  is  visible  as  an  amorphous,  glistening  patch  of  colour, 
rolling and shining in shades of its pale colours that match 
nothing in the known spectrum. This patch pours over the 
ground or flies in a living fashion. When it feeds, its victim’s 
skin and face glow with the colour.

Though  incorporeal,  its  passing  nonetheless  feels  like 
the  touch  of  a  slimy,  unhealthy  vapor.  Geiger  counters 
register its presence as a distinctive burst of radiation. With 
today’s light-intensification gear, it shows as a bright patch 
of luminosity. Infrared viewers are useless.

Colours come from the depths of space, where natural 
laws  differ.  Adult  colours  create  embryos,  harmless  three-
inch  spheres  seemingly  empty.  Deposited  on  verdant  soil 
or in shallow waters, the embryo begins to germinate. After 
a  few  days,  the  outer  shell  dissolves  and  the  new  creature, 
which we may term a larva, emerges.

The jellylike larva can grow to great size. As it infiltrates 
the  ecosystem,  local  vegetation  exhibits  a  tremendous  but 
unhealthy growth. Fruit tastes bitter. Insects and animals are 
born deformed. At night, all plant life glows with the colour, 
and the vegetation begins to twist and writhe, as though in a 
strong wind. Even humans shine with the spectral light. Af-
ter a few months, the larva transforms into a young colour.
It now makes brief trips from its lair to feed, and begins 
to  drain  the  life  force  from  the  area  previously  affected 
by the larva. When it drains enough energy, it departs the 
planet for space and adulthood. In so maturing, the colour 
may drain life force from an area of five acres or so if rich in 
life, or perhaps 10-20 acres of moor or grassland. The area 
drained is ruined thereafter, and no plant can grow.

Bright light inhibits a colour. It spends daylight hours in 
dark, cool hideaways, preferably underwater: cisterns, wells, 
lakes, reservoirs, and oceans are all suitable.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Disintegrate: A colour can focus its energies to disintegrate 
a  hole  through  almost  any  material.  This  ability  is  used 
primarily to excavate a lair underground. The same effort to 
melt a cubic foot of titanium removes several cubic yards of 
pinewood. The sides of the hole appear melted, but no heat 
is generated.

Solidify:  A  colour  can  concentrate  and  solidify  a  part  of 
itself. That part becomes translucent. It can then manipulate 
objects.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 1
Since a colour is so efficient an attacker, Keepers may wish to allow 
investigators  to  see  it  coming,  allowing  Spot  Hidden  rolls  to 
detect its slight glow or to notice a sudden presence of ozone. 
Colours  lack  any  recognized  Fighting  skill  and  cannot  be 
harmed by normal means.

Characteristic Drain: When the colour is feeding, the victim must 
make an opposed POW roll. If the colour wins, it permanently 
drains  1D10  points  each  of  STR,  CON,  POW,  DEX,  and APP 
from  the  victim,  and  costs  him  or  her  1D6  hit  points  as  well. 
Each point of POW so drained increases the colour’s POW. The 
victim is aware of a sucking, burning sensation and progressively 
withers and greys. The victim’s face sinks, the skin ageing with 
hideous cracks and wrinkles. Once drained, the victim dies.
Mental Attack: A colour can weaken the minds of nearby sentient 
beings. For each day in the colour’s vicinity, each person must 
make an opposed INT roll or lose 1D6 magic points and 1D6 
Sanity  points.  Magic  points  so  destroyed  cannot  be  regained 
without leaving the area. The influence also strongly binds the 
victim to his or her home and the influence becomes increas-
ingly irresistible as the victim’s will weakens. To leave the area, 
he or she must make a successful Hard or Extreme POW roll 
(half  POW  if  magic  points  are  reduced  by  50%,  or  one-fifth 
of POW if magic points have been reduced to 0 or less), or be 
inexplicably compelled to stay.

Crawling One

Could  the  colour  of  out  space  have  sought  Earth  as 
place to pupate or gestate its young? Perhaps the Earth 
provides  a  safe  and  bountiful  haven  against  other-
worldly Mythos predators. What strange experiments 
would the mi-go perform if they successfully captured 
or reared a colour?

Crawling One
Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy the town at night 
whose wizards are all ashes. For it is of old rumor that the 
soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his charnel clay, 
but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws; till out of 
corruption horrid life springs, and the dull scavengers of earth 
wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it. Great 
holes secretly are digged where earth’s pores ought to suffice, 
and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Festival

A crawling one is composed of thousands of worms and mag-
gots. Each worm is individually alive and constantly moves, 
though they generally hold the shape of a human body. The 
collective mass of wriggling creatures possesses the mind of 
a dead sorcerer, long since devoured by the maggoty horde. 
The ingested "will" of the wizard effectively drives the mass to 
work collectively to perform deeds and actions.

SPECIAL POWERS

Crawling ones cannot speak but can write messages. It is un-
necessary for them to use spoken words in performing spells 
or when communing with their alien masters or creatures 
from beyond. 

Spells: Each crawling one knows at least 1D10 spells.

Fighting attacks: Crawling ones can use weapons as humans do, 
however they prefer to use spells or their minions to undertake 
physical tasks. 

Fighting 35% (17/7), damage 1D3 (unarmed) or by weapon type
Dodge 20% (10/4)
Armor: None; however due to the soft and resilient quality of the 
crawling one’s bodies, normal weapons do minimal damage to

Skills: Stealth 60%. 
Sanity Loss: 1D3/2D6 Sanity points to see a crawling one.

Dagon & Hydra (Unique Beings)

Vast, Polyphemous-like, and loathsome, it darted like a 
stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about 
which it flung its gigantic scaly arms.

—H.P. Lovecraft, Dagon 

Father Dagon and Mother Hydra are deep ones who have 
grown enormously in size and age, each over 20 feet tall and 
perhaps millions of years old. They rule the deep ones and 
lead  them  in  their  worship  of  Cthulhu.  This  pair  is  active 
and mobile, unlike Cthulhu and his minions, but are rarely 
met.  Dagon  and  Hydra’s  characteristics  are  identical.  It  is 
possible  that  more  than  two  deep  ones  have  grown  to  the

The  worship  of  Dagon  by  humanity  appears  to  be 
ancient,  with  many  cults  flourishing  and  dying  out 
throughout  history.  Often  hidden  behind  a  benign 
façade,  such  cults  operate  in  public  with  only  the 
members  of  the  inner  circle  aware  of  the  true  nature 
and purpose of the cult. 

The  Phoenicians,  Sumerians,  Cannanites,  and 
Philistines  all  appear  to  have  revered  a  fertility  god 
named  Dagon  or  Dagan.  The  Dogon  People  of  Mali 
revere amphibious, fishlike ancestor spirits who came 
to Earth in the distant past, as twins from an invisible 
star, whose return will herald a new age.

Keen observers state that the growth of the Esoteric 
Order of Dagon, popular with the residents of seaports 
and towns along the New England coast, is something 
to be watched closely.

Some  claim  that  Dagon  and  Hydra  are  but  facets 
or  avatars  of  Great  Cthulhu,  being  the  elements  or 
portions of that immense being that were not trapped 
in R’lyeh beneath the ocean.

These beings are enormous writhing masses, formed out of 
ropy black tentacles. Here and there over the surfaces of the 
things are great puckered mouths that drip green goo. 

Beneath the creatures, tentacles end in black hooves, on 
which they stamp. The monsters roughly resemble trees in 
silhouette—the  trunks  being  the  short  legs,  and  the  tops 
of the trees represented by the ropy, branching bodies. The 
whole  mass  of  these  things  smell  like  open  graves.  Dark 
young stand between 12 and 20 feet tall.

Such entities are the “young” referred to in Shub-Niggu-
rath’s epithet, “Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand 
Young.”  They  are  closely  connected  to  her,  and  are  found 
only  in  areas  where  she  is  worshiped.  Dark  young  act  as 
proxies  for  Shub-Niggurath  in  accepting  sacrifices,  ac-
cepting worship from cultists, devouring non-cultists, and 
spreading their mother’s faith across the world. Luckily, they 
are rarely met with.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Spells: Each dark young knows a number of spells equal to 
a tenth of its INT.

Dark Young

Something black in the road, something that wasn’t a tree. 
Something big and black and ropy, just squatting there, 
waiting, with ropy arms squirming and reaching… It came 
crawling up the hillside…and it was the black thing of 
my dreams—that black, ropy, slimy jelly tree-thing out of 
the woods. It crawled up and it flowed up on its hoofs and 
mouths and snaky arms.

—Robert Bloch, Notebook Found in a Deserted House

287 

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsATTACKS
Attacks per round: 5. Dark young may only use a Trample attack 

once per round.

Fighting attacks: In its masses of tentacles, a typical dark young 
has four thicker sinuous tentacles with which it attacks. Each 
of these thicker tentacles can strike out to injure. It may also 
kick out with its hooves, simply crush, or strike with its massive 
bulk.

Grab  (mnvr):  The  Dark  young  can  use  its  tentacles  to  grab  and 
capture  up  to  four  victims.  If  a  victim  is  grabbed,  he  or  she 
is held to one of the horrible sucking mouths and drained of 
1D10+5 STR per round. This STR loss can-
not  be  restored.  While  being  drained, 
a  victim  is  capable  only  of  ineffectual 
writhing and screaming. 

Trample: The dark young can also tram-
ple  with  its  massive  hooves,  typically 
hooting  and  bellowing  as  it  rears  up 
and attempts to trample as many oppo-
nents as it can (up to 1D4 humans if they 
are situated close together).

Armor: Dark young are of non-Earthly material and make-up, 
so that any successful hit with a firearm attack does only 1 
point of damage per bullet (2 points for an impale). Hand-
to-hand  weapons  do  normal  damage.  Attacks  dependent  on 
heat, blast, corrosion, electrical charge, or poisoning have no 
effect.

sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws 
were webbed. They hopped irregularly, sometimes on hind 
legs and sometimes on four… their croaking, baying voices… 
held all the dark shades of expression which their staring  
faces lacked.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Shadow over Innsmouth

The deep ones are an amphibious race that primarily serves 
Cthulhu and two beings known as Father Dagon and Mother 
Hydra. Locked in the timeless depths of the sea, their alien, 
arrogant  lives  are  coldly  beautiful,  unbelievably  cruel, 
and effectively immortal. They come together to 
mate or to worship Great Cthulhu, but do not 
crave touching or being touched as humans 
do.  They  are  a  marine  race,  unknown  in 
freshwater  environments,  and  globally 
have  many  cities,  all  submerged  be-
neath the waves. One is off the coast 
of  Massachusetts,  near  Innsmouth, 
while  other  sites  are  rumored  to  lie  off 
the British Isles. 

Deep  ones  may  be  worshiped  by 
humans  with  whom  they  regularly 
interbreed, for deep ones are immor-
tal  unless  slain,  and  so  are  any  hybrid 

offspring.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Breathe underwater: Dwelling under the sea, deep ones re-
quire no exterior help to breathe underwater and are equally 
capable of breathing on land.

Spells: Deep ones have a 40% chance of knowing 1D4 spells.

Recent  research  by  field  archaeologists  in  central  En-
gland have uncovered curious clues about an ancient 
Pagan  fertility  cult.  The  findings  reveal  an  unhealthy 
devotion to trees and darkly suggest hideous religious 
rites  involving  the  sacrifice  of  virgins  to  something 
named only as the "Withering Tree."

Perhaps connected are the claims of certain Ama-
zonian elders who speak of regions of the jungle that 
walk, and how gifts must be given to the "tall ones" 
to satiate their hunger. Indeed, a handful of travelers in 
these regions have returned with strange tales of being 
awoken  at  night  by  vines  seemingly  encroaching  on 
their tents, with some going as far to claim that they 
awoke to find black vines encircling their legs or arms.

Deep One
I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though 
they had white bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, 
but the ridges of their backs were scaly. Their forms vaguely 
suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads 
of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the

Call of CthulhuFor centuries the deep ones have had to build their fab-
ulous underwater cities, hidden in the deepest oceans 
for no man to see. Occasionally found in the diaries, 
memoirs, or tales of sailors, fishermen, and pearl divers 
are hints and claims of strange jewelry, huge worked 
stones (often encrusted with mother of pearl) and, of 
course, mermaids.

If  collected  together,  such  stories  might  lead  one 
to conclude that certain regions are host to immortal 
deep  one  communities.  Names  such  as  Ahu-Y’hloa, 
Y’ha-nth-lei, and G’ll-oo have been recorded.

Deep One Hybrid

It was a thin, stoop-shouldered man not 
much under six feet tall… His age was 
perhaps thirty-five, but the odd, deep 
creases in the sides of his neck made 
him seem older when one did not 
study his dull, expressionless face. He 
had a narrow head, bulging, watery 
blue eyes that seemed never to wink, 
a flat nose, a receding forehead and 
chin, and singularly underdeveloped 
ears. His long, thick lip and coarse 
pored, greyish cheeks seemed 
almost beardless except for 
some sparse yellow hairs that 
Deep One Hybrid
straggled and curled in irregular patches; and in places the 
surface seemed queerly irregular, as if peeling from some 
cutaneous disease. 

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Shadow over Innsmouth

Deep one hybrids are the progeny of deep one and human 
mating. Although the offspring of such unions are usually 
born as normal humans, changes in appearance and physi-
ology tend to occur in late teens—commonly known as the 
"Innsmouth  Look."  By  middle  age,  most  hybrids  display 
some  form  of  gross  deformity  and  such  individuals  retire 
to the privacy of their close-shuttered homes. Within a few 
years, the hybrid undergoes the final transformation into a 
deep one and embarks on a new life in the sea.

The physical changes are accompanied by an awakening 
of new senses, strange dreams of undersea cities, and a long-
ing to visit seaside locales—particularly ancestral homes or 
the individual’s birth place. 

Typically, hybrids inhabit remote coastal villages, how-
ever  they  can  be  found  further  afield  (particularly  in  the 
early stages of their transformation). As the final transfor-
mations take place the hybrid either learns to embrace their 
monstrous heritage or goes mad in the process.

Deep ones will attempt to lure hybrids to their lairs or 
places of safety, where they can supervise the final metamor-
phosis  and  ensure  the  hybrid  is  appropriately  schooled  in 
their  shared  heritage. About  10%  of  hybrids  do  not  com-

plete the transformation and are doomed to spend the rest 
of their life as a half-human half-deep one, while a further 
10%  do  not  undergo  the  metamorphosis  at  all,  with  the 
deep  one  genes  essentially  missing  a  generation—only  to 
manifest in a future descendent.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Breathe underwater: Hybrids are unable to breathe under-
water until they have undergone the full change into a deep 
one; however, from early childhood onwards they can remain 
underwater for up to twice as long as the average human.

Spells:  Older  hybrids  who  have  begun  to  embrace  their 
watery heritage have a 10% chance of knowing 1D3 spells.

Dhole

Below him the ground was festering with gigantic Dholes, 
and even as he looked, one reared up several hundred feet and 
levelled a bleached, viscous end at him.

—H.P. Lovecraft and E. Hoffman Price,  
Through the Gate of the Silver Key

Dholes are gigantic wormlike burrowing horrors. They are 
not native to the Earth and none seem to have been brought 
here for more than brief periods, fortunately, for they seem 
to have riddled and laid waste to several other worlds. They 
dislike light, though it does not visibly harm them. They are 
only rarely seen in daylight, and then only on planets that 
they  have  thoroughly  conquered.  Some  unknown  relation 
between dholes and chthonians may exist. Similar creatures, 
bholes, exist in the Dreamlands.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 1
Fighting attacks: The massive, fast-moving bulk of these things is 
very dangerous for fleshy mortals to approach. A blow from its 
bulk is like being hit by a train. If a dhole crushes an investiga-
tor, death is automatic. With a successful Luck roll, enough can 
be found to bury.

Goo Attack: In lieu of swallowing or crushing a target, a dhole can 
spit  a  gob  of  slimy  goo  from  its  mouth  up  to  a  range  of  2-3 
miles. The goo covers a circular area with a diameter equal to 
1% of the monster’s SIZ in feet: thus a dhole of SIZ 2750 spits 
a glob 27 feet across, big enough to bring down an airplane.
Any  living  thing  struck  by  the  glob  is  stunned  and  engulfed. 
Climbing out of a mass of goo requires an Extreme STR roll; 
make  one  attempt  per  round.  While  buried  in  the  frightful 
slime, the investigator cannot breathe and begins to drown. In 
addition, the caustic slime costs the investigator 1 hit point per 
round her or she is held. Once the victim escapes, the burning 
damage stops.

Engulf: If a dhole swallows (engulfs) someone, it scoops clean an 

area equal in size to the area of its goo attack.

Dhole

The  great  wizard,  Ay-i-Shak  the  Cunning,  claimed  in 
his blasphemous memoirs that he visited and consorted 
with  the  bholes  in  the  land  of  dream,  learning  that 
these immense beings were the true mothers of dholes. 
Through unfathomable means, the bholes were able to 
send their dhole progeny across space and time to plan-
ets in the Waking World. Ay-i-Shak writes that he was 
barely able to escape with his life from the encounter; 
it was only the timely sacrifice of his young assistant, 
Mamoud, which enabled the wizard to make his escape.

Dimensional Shambler

Shuffling towards him in the darkness was the gigantic, 
blasphemous form of a thing not wholly ape and not wholly 
insect. Its hide hung loosely upon its frame, and its rugose, 
dead-eyed rudiment of a head swayed drunkenly from side to 
side. Its forepaws were extended, with talons spread wide, and 
its whole body was taut with murderous malignity despite its 
utter lack of facial description.
—H.P. Lovecraft and Hazel Heald, The Horror in the Museum

Little  is  known  about  these  beings  save  their  name  and  a 
description  of  a  hide.  It  is  assumed  that  they  are  entities 
capable  of  walking  between  the  planes  and  worlds  of  the 
universe, never spending much time at any one location.

Rumors  suggest  that  these  entities  occasionally  serve  a 
god or a Great Old One, however their individual motiva-
tions and purpose remain a mystery.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Trans-dimensional Travel: Able to leave a plane of existence 
at will, signaling the change by beginning to shimmer and 
fade. This transition costs them 4 magic points and takes a 
round to complete. During this time they may be attacked, 
however they cannot inflict damage on their attackers.

A  shambler  can  take  objects  or  beings  with  it  when  it 
fades  into  another  dimension.  By  clutching  the  desired 
object in its talons and expending an additional magic point 
per 50 SIZ points of the object or creature, that which is held 
makes  the  transit  also.  Objects  and  victims  lost  are  never 
found again.

Spells: Dimensional shamblers have a 40% 

chance of knowing 1D3 spells.

290 

Call of CthulhuA complete description of one of these beings can be found in 
At the Mountains of Madness by Lovecraft: it notes that the en-
tity stands about eight feet tall, with a six-foot torso, and that 
it has wings, which neatly fold up into slots. In that story this 
race is referred to as the Old Ones. Elder things communicate 
by piping whistles and can sense without light.

Elder things came to Earth a billion years ago and may 
have accidentally started terrestrial life through arcane ex-
perimentation. They created the blasphemous shoggoths to 
serve as slaves. Their race began to degenerate before man 
evolved, and they at least partially lost their former ability 
to fly through space on their membranous wings. After nu-
merous wars with other races, the mi-go and the star-spawn 
prime among them, and the rebellion of their former slaves, 
the shoggoths, the amphibious elder things were eventually 
driven back to Antarctica in the last few million years, where 
their last city remains frozen under a glacier. Their civiliza-
tion was eventually wiped out by the cold of the ice age. The 
elder things are extinct on land, however they may still have 
colonies in the deepest waters. 

Time-travelling  witches  and  sorcerers  have  sometimes 
sought  out  elder  things  in  order  to  further  their  learning 
and  understanding  of  the  universe  and  Mythos  matters. 
Such  testimony  also  hints  at  non-degenerate  elder  things 
still living among the stars.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Spells:  Elder  things  have  a  70%  chance  of  knowing  1D4 
spells.

They represented some ridged barrel-shaped object with

ly tapering arms arranged around it like the arms 
of a starfish.

Fire  vampires  are  minions  of  the  Great  Old  One  named 
Cthugha and, like him, dwell on or near the star Fomalhaut. 
They come to Earth when summoned or when accompany-

Fighting Attacks: Fire vampires attack by touching their victims, 
and can set flammable objects alight  by  touch. They  damage 
humans by heat-shock. To determine the heat-shock, roll 2D6 
damage  for  the  vampire’s  attack.  If  the  investigator  passes  a 
CON roll, half of this damage is taken; if failed, the full damage 
is inflicted.

In the same attack, the vampire will try to steal magic points from 
its  target:  use  an  opposed  POW  roll;  if  the  vampire  wins,  it 
steals 1D10 magic points from the victim; if the target wins the 
roll, the fire vampire loses one of its own magic points. Thus, 

Fire Vampire

heat damage and once to determine magic point loss.

Armor: Standard material weapons cannot harm them, (blades, bul-

poured over it, a typical handheld fire extinguisher does 1D6 hit 
points of damage to it, while a bucket of water costs it 1D3 hit 
points.

Flying Polyp
A horrible elder race of half polypous, utterly alien entities…
They were only partly material and had the power of aerial 
motion, despite the absence of wings…Suggestions of a 
monstrous plasticity and of temporary lapses of visibility…
singular whistling noises and colossal foot-prints  
made up of five circular toe marks seemed  
also to be associated with them. 

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Shadow Out of Time

This  unnamed  species  came  to  Earth  from  space  as  con-
querors  about  seven  hundred  and  fifty  million  years  ago. 
They  built  basalt  cities  with  high  windowless  towers  and 
inhabited  three  other  planets  in  the  solar  system  as  well. 
On Earth, they warred with the Great Race of Yith and were 
finally defeated and forced underground. At the close of the 
Cretaceous  era  (about  50  million  years  ago)  they  rose  up 
from their subterranean haunts and extracted their revenge 
by exterminating the Great Race.

Polyps still remain in their deep caverns and seem con-
tent to remain there, annihilating the few beings who chance 
upon them. The entrances to their dwellings are mostly deep 
within ancient ruins where there are great wells sealed over 
with stone. Inside these wells dwell the polyps still, ferocious 
alien fighters with a bewildering variety of attacks.

Ancient tales tell that they have the power to control great 
winds, able to cause devastation, as well as target individuals. 

292 

Call of CthulhuSPECIAL POWERS 

Invisibility: By spending 1 magic point per round, a polyp 
can turn totally invisible. It still can be roughly located by 
the constant, nauseating piping sound that always accom-
panies it. Anyone trying to hit an invisible polyp must make 
a successful Listen roll to tell where it is, and if located, any 
rolls to hit it are made with one penalty die. 

Polyps naturally phase in and out of visibility, so a Luck 
roll  must  be  made  with  each  attack  made  upon  it.  If  the 
Luck roll is failed the Polyp phases just at that moment and 
the  attack  is  made  with  one  penalty  die. When  a  polyp  is 
invisible, it does not attack with its tentacles, but may still 
use one of the wind attacks or cast spells.

Spells: Polyps have a 70% chance of knowing 1D10 spells.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 2D6 (each round, roll 2D6 to determine how 
many tentacles form); may use only one wind-based attack per 
round.

Fighting Attacks:  Polyps continually  form and dissolve  tentacles 
from their bodies. Tentacle damage is always 1D10. Because of 
the partially nonmaterial nature of these entities, the tentacle’s 
damage is done directly to the target’s hit points, ignor-
ing any body armor. The wound takes the form of a 
windburn or desiccation of tissue.

Note:  Each  of  the  polypoid  wind  abilities  cost 

them 1 magic point per round to use.
Wind  Blast:  The  wind  blast  has  a  base 
range of 20 yards and a 10-yard-di-
ameter  cylinder  of  effect  ema-
nating  from  the  polyp,  doing 
damage  equal  to  the  polyp’s 
damage  bonus.  The  cylindrical 
blast  can  extend  further  than 
20 yards, but loses 1D6 damage 
for  each  multiple  of  the  base 
distance—thus a target at 39 yards 
would  take  4D6  (damage  bonus 
minus 1D6), and a target at 41 yards 
would take 3D6 damage. Victims of the 
wind blast literally have their flesh stripped 
from  their  bones  and  their  skin  dehydrated  and 
wind-burned, and are blown backwards for a number 
of yards equal to the hit points they have lost.

Fixing Attack: This  is  a  mysterious  method  for  capturing 
prey. In this mode, the wind attack has a range of 1,000 
yards  and  can  blow  without  diminishment  around 
corners or up through winding corridors. Although the 

wind emanates from the polyp, it has a peculiar sucking effect 
on the target, slowing down him or her and forcing the target to 
make an opposed STR roll versus the polyp’s POW. Beyond 200 
yards this becomes less effective and one bonus die is granted 
to the target. If the polyp wins, the victim cannot move away 
that round. If the target wins, he or she may move normally. 
The flying polyp can move at full speed while using this ability, 
so it may be both chasing interesting prey and slowing it.
This  technique  may  be  used  on  multiple  targets  within  30  yards 
of one another. Each other target gains one bonus die on the 
STR roll to oppose the polyp. The polyp may choose its targets.
Windstorm Attack: A polyp can generate a wind in conjunction 
with  its  fellows.  The  windstorm  has  a  speed  of  half  a  mile 
per  hour  per  point  of  POW  of  the  participating  polyp.  This 
windstorm is local, losing 5 mph of force for every 200 yards it 
travels. A group of polyps can generate hurricane-force winds 
within an area of a few square miles. Targets take 1D4 damage 
for  every  20  mph  above  100  mph  of  wind  speed;  those  that 
succeed in a Luck roll take half damage.

Fighting 85% (42/17), damage 1D10

Armor:  4  points,  plus  invisibility.  The  extra-terrene  polyp  takes 
only  minimum  damage  from  physical  weapons,  which  is 
reduced  again  by  4  points  due  to  the  monster’s  skin  armor. 
Enchanted weapons do full normal damage, as do forces such 
as heat or electricity.

Sanity Loss: 1D3/1D20 Sanity points to see a flying polyp.

Formless Spawn
When the men of K’n-Yan went down into N’Kai’s black abyss 
with their great atom-power searchlights, they found living 
things—living things that oozed along stone channels and 
worshipped onyx and basalt images of Tsathoggua. But they 
were not toads like Tsathoggua himself. Far worse—
they were amorphous lumps of viscous black 
slime that took temporary shapes for various 
purposes. The explorers of K’N-Yan did not 
pause for detailed observations, and those 
that escaped alive sealed the passage. 
—H.P. Lovecraft and Zealia Bishop, The 
Mound

These  black,  protean  beings  change 
shapes  in  an  instant,  from  toad-like 
lumps to elongated things with hun-
dreds of rudimentary legs. They ooze 
through  small  cracks  and  enlarge 
their  appendages  at  will.  They  are 
closely  associated  with  Tsathoggua, 
often found in his temples or in sun-

less caverns.

ATTACKS 
Attacks per round: 2 (limited to 1 Bite per round)
Fighting  attacks:  Due  to  their  extreme  fluidity  they  are  able  to 
attack in a wide variety of ways, forming whips, tentacles, and 
other  appendages  with  which  to  bludgeon  and  strike  their 
opponents.

Bite: The victim is instantly swallowed. Each round thereafter the 
victim takes 1 point of damage from constriction—the damage 
done  per  round  progressively  increasing  by  1  point  (e.g.,  on 
the second round 2 points of damage are taken, and so forth). 
While  swallowed,  the  victim  may  take  no  action  whatsoever, 
though friends may attempt to slay the monster to free him or 
her. A formless spawn can make one Bite attack per round and 
can continue to swallow prey until having swallowed its own 
SIZ  in  prey. While  digesting  a  victim,  a  spawn  may  continue 
to fight but may not shift location without disgorging what it 
has swallowed.

Grab  (mnvr):  Grabs  an  opponent  using  one  of  its  whip  like

Formless Spawn

Ghast

Repulsive beings which die in the light…and leap on long 
hind legs…a pair of yellowish red eyes…Ghasts have indeed 
an excellent sense of smell…something about the size of a 
small horse hopped out into the grey twilight, and Carter 
turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome 
beast, whose face is so curiously human despite the absence 
of a nose, a forehead, and other particulars…They spoke in 
coughing gutturals.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath

Ghasts  are  restricted  to  the  underworld  and  vast  caverns 
where  sunlight  never  comes.  Exposed  to  direct  sunlight, 
they sicken and eventually die. Ghasts are cannibalistic and 
eat one another as well as other beings they catch.

The  horrible,  semi-human  bipeds  ridden  by  the  high-
ly-scientific but morally-degenerate humans inhabiting the 
cavern of K’n-Yan may be relatives of, or even be examples 
of, ghasts. If this is the case, then ghasts are likely the result 
of serpent people genetic experimentation. Ghasts are evi-
dently tamable, though primitive and savage.

Ghoul

These figures were seldom completely human, but often 
approached humanity in varying degree. Most of the bodies, 
while roughly bipedal, had a forward slumping, and a 
vaguely canine cast. The texture of the majority was a kind of 
unpleasant rubberiness.

—H.P. Lovecraft, Pickman’s Model

Call of CthulhuGhouls are loathsome humanoids with rubbery skin, hoof-
like  feet,  canine  features,  and  claws.  They  speak  in  what 
are  described  as  gibberings  and  meepings.  They  are  often 
encrusted with grave mold collected as they feed.

They dwell in tunnel systems beneath many cities, often 
centered  on  graveyards  and  ancient  catacombs.  They  are 
known  to  have  commerce  with  witches  and  those  seeking 
unspeakable  pleasures,  although  an  unwitting  human  is 
more likely to be attacked when encountered. 

Dark  lore  suggests  that  it  is  possible  for  a  human  to 

transform into a ghoul over a prolonged period.

Ghouls may be the truth that lies behind the myth of 
the  changeling—the  belief  that  faeries  steal  young 
babies, leaving "wild things" in their place. The wild 
things appear human initially, becoming stranger and 
weirder  as  they  grow  older  until  one  day,  normally 
around maturity, they disappear. 

Gla'aki, Servant of
A hand came scrabbling up out to lever it up!…the hand of a 
corpse—bloodless and skeletal, and with  
impossibly long, cracked nails.

—R. Campbell, The Inhabitant of the Lake

Gla'aki’s slaves are undead things created by his spines. They 
share Gla'aki’s memories and become almost a part of the 
Great Old One, though they can perform many individual 
actions. 

At first they look human enough, if stiff and corpselike, 
but in time they wither and look like the undead monsters 
they  are.  After  six  decades  of  half-death,  the  servants  of 
Gla'aki  become  subject  to  the  Green  Decay  if  exposed  to 
intense light, such as daylight. The Green Decay begins to 
rot on the spot, destroying one so exposed in a few hours.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Spells: Servants of Gla'aki do not generally have any spells, 
though they retain any they knew while alive, plus any new 
spells taught by Gla'aki (at the Keeper’s discretion).

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsGnoph-Keh
Gnoph-Keh, the hairy myth-thing of the Greenland ice, that 
walked sometimes on two legs, sometimes on  
four, and sometimes on six.
— H.P. Lovecraft and Hazel Heald, The Horror in the Museum

In earlier stories, Gnoph-Keh appears to be a single being. 
Later it seems to be a race of beings, possibly even a degen-
erate tribe. Here we assume that it is a sparse race of beings, 
associated with Ithaqua. 

Usually  only  one  gnoph-keh  is  encountered  at  a  time 
and the race is generally restricted to glaciers, ice caps, and 
extremely cold and icy areas. Especially harsh winters may 
bring them down into the lowlands. If a human tribe have 
indeed named themselves after the fabled gnoph-keh, per-
haps  they  worship  the  gnoph-keh  as  a  deity  or  use  it  as  a 
totem beast.

SPECIAL POWERS

Blizzard:  The  gnoph-keh  has  the  power  to  summon  a 
small  blizzard  about  itself,  restricting  visibility  to  3  yards 
maximum. This costs the creature 1 magic point per hour 
and yields a blizzard with a radius of 100 yards. That radius 
may be increased by 100 more yards for every extra magic 
point  expended.  On  the  rare  occasions  that  two  or  more 
gnoph-kehs work together, they may combine their magic 
points to create gigantic blizzards. The blizzard will always 
be centered on the gnoph-keh. 

Every 15 minutes that an investigator spends within such 
a blizzard, the player must make a CON roll or have his or her 
investigator lose 1 hit point to freezing damage (if not properly 
protected against the ice and wind). Note that no recovery of 
hit points may take place while exposed to the blizzard.

Generate Cold: The  gnoph-keh  can  also  create  an  intense 
cold around its body by expending magic points. For each 

Gnoph-Keh

magic  point  the  gnoph-keh  spends,  the  temperature  goes 
down by 20°F for an hour in a 100-yard radius. If the crea-
ture desires, it can combine the cold and blizzard attacks to 
create a terrifying local storm.

Spells: Gnoph-keh have a 75% chance of knowing 1D10 spells.

Great Race of Yith

Enormous, iridescent cones, about ten feet high and ten feet 
wide at the base, and made up of some ridgy, scaly, semi-elastic 
matter. From their apexes projected four flexible, cylindrical 
members, each a foot thick, and of a ridgy substance like that of 
the cones themselves. These members were sometimes contracted 
almost to nothing, and sometimes extended to any distance 
up to about ten feet. Terminating two of them were enormous 
claws or nippers. At the end of a third were four red trumpet-like 
appendages. The fourth terminated in an irregular yellowish 
globe some two feet in diameter and having three great dark 
eyes ranged along its central circumference . . . Surmounting this 
head were four slender grey stalks bearing flowerlike appendages, 
whilst from its nether side dangled eight greenish antennae or 
tentacles. The great base of the central cone was ringed with a 
rubbery grey substance which moved the whole entity  
through expansion and contraction.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Shadow Out of Time

A species of time-traveling mental entities, fleeing their 
own  world’s  destruction.  They  came  to  Earth  and 
took over the minds and bodies of the cone-shaped 
beings  dwelling  here.  The  combination  of  the 
Earth-born bodies and the minds of the aliens

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 2 (the Lightning Gun may only be fired once 

each round).

Fighting  attacks:  In  combat,  a  member  of  this  race  may  use  its 
pincers to attack. It also possesses great size that it may use to 
crush or hit an investigator. However, this civilized race avoids 
hand-to-hand combat, preferring weapons that fire great gouts 
of electricity—weapons that were originally created to destroy 
the flying polyps.

Lightning Gun: There are many varieties of Lightning Guns (see 
page 272). A common one contains a pack of 32 charges and 
takes  1  round  to  reload.  As  many  charges  as  desired  may  be 
fired as a single shot, however each charge past 4 fired at once 
gives a 5% accumulating chance of burning-out the gun. Thus, 
if 7 charges were fired at once, 
the gun would be ruined on 
a  separate  1D100  result  of 
15 or less.

Yithian

Each  charge  does  1D10  points 
of  damage  to  the  target,  so 
that 3 charges would do 3D10 
points of damage. The gun has 
a  basic  range  of  100  yards. 
For  each  100  yards  fired 
past  that  base  apply  one 
penalty die to the roll to hit.

made  the  Great  Race.  They  taught  their  young  their  own 
technology  and  culture.  Those  young  grew  up  as  true  in-
heritors of the mentalists and the new bodies were natural 
to them. In the aeons that followed, the Great Race divided 
the Earth between themselves, the mi-go, and Cthulhu’s kin. 
Cthulhu  and  his  kind  ruled  from  the  Pacific  and  the  lost 
lands  of  R’lyeh  and  Mu.  The  mi-go  controlled  the  North, 
while  in  the  south  the  Great  Race  were  supreme.  Their 
greatest city was Pnakotus, in modern-day Australia.

This  race  flourished  from  about  four  hundred  million 
years ago until fifty million years ago, when they were ex-
terminated by the flying polyps, an ancient race which they 
had imprisoned when they first came to Earth. However, the 
minds of the Great Race had foreseen their doom and so fled 
their cone-shaped bodies, mentally travelling into the future 
and imposing their minds in the bodies of a beetle-like race 
destined to succeed mankind.

The  Great  Race  reproduce  by  means  of  spores,  but  do 
so  infrequently  because  of  their  long  individual  life  spans 
(4,000 to 5,000 years). Members feed solely on liquids.

The  Yithians  are  a  race  of  socialist  individuals.  They 
value intelligence above all else and use it as their criterion 
for immigration. Resources are shared among their kind out 
of a sense of intellectual logic and proportion. Strife is rare. 
The Great Race worship no gods.

SPECIAL POWERS
Time  Travel:  The  Great  Race  are  so-named  because  they 
conquered  time  so  thoroughly—the  only  race  known 
to have done so. A member of the race can send its mind 
forward  or  backward  through  time  and  across  space,  pick 
out a suitable subject and trade minds with it; whenever a 
member of the Great Race takes over the body of a being, 
that being’s mind is transferred into the body of the Great 
Race individual, there to stay until the being now inhabiting 
its old body sees fit to return and trade places once more. 
With this technique the race has traveled en masse through 
time and space and conquered other planets.

Keen students of history, an individual exchanges places 
with  a  select  individual  in  the  era  it  wishes  to  study.  The 
minds are switched for about five years. On Earth, friends 
notice  many  differences  about  the  substitute:  an  INT  roll 
would be appropriate to notice this.

Once forced into the alien Great Race body, the victim is 
caused to write down everything known about his or her own 
time. The Great Race are fairly kindly and permit their cap-
tives to travel about and see the country, as well as allowing 
them  to  meet  other  victims  like  themselves,  generally  from 
far-distant planets or eras. When the time comes to restore 
a  victim  to  his  or  her  own  body,  the  Great  Race  blanks  all 
memory of what has happened while the victim was trapped 
in their age. This erasure is imperfect: the victim may dream 
and have nightmares of being held by the Great Race.

A cult on present-day Earth aids and abets Great Race 
visitors.  In  exchange,  the  visitors  share  technological  or 
magical  knowledge.  Time-travel  is  the  primary  means  by 
which  a  member  of  this  race  could  be  met  in  its  original 
cone-body, though there have been scattered cases involving 
stasis cubes and sorcerous summonings across the aeons.

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien gods 
Hounds of Tindalos
“They are lean and athirst!” he shrieked . . .“All the evil in the 
universe was concentrated in their lean, hungry bodies. Or 
had they bodies? I saw them only for a moment,  
I cannot be certain.”

—Frank Belknap Long, The Hounds of Tindalos

The  hounds  of  Tindalos  dwell  in  the  distant  past  of  the 
earth, when normal life has not yet advanced past one-celled 
animals. They inhabit the angles of time, while other beings 
(such as mankind and all common life) descend from curves. 
This concept is hard to imagine and only seems to be used 
with  respect  to  them.  The  hounds  lust  after  something  in 
mankind and other normal life, following victims through 
time and space to get it. They are immortal.

Just  what  these  creatures  look  like  is  unknown,  since 
those who meet them seem not to survive. A hound of Tin-
dalos is unlikely to look like a hound dog and more like to 
be some form of alien terror consisting of razor-sharp teeth 
and claws, burning eyes, and pulsating blue-tinged skin.

Because  of  their  relationship  with  the  angles  of  time, 
they can materialize through any corner if it is sharp (120° 
or less). The rooms of most human houses have walls that 
meet  at  90°.  When  a  hound  manifests,  it  first  appears  as 
smoke pouring from the corner, from which the head and 
then the thing’s body emerges.

Once  a  human  (usually  an  unwitting  time  traveler) 
has become known to one of these creatures, it will pursue 
the individual relentlessly to get to him. To figure the time 
before  the  hound  of  Tindalos  reaches  its  prey,  determine 
the  number  of  years  between  the  prey’s  present  time  and 
the  time  when  spotted  by  the  creature.  Then  divide  the 
number of years by 100,000,000 to get the number of days 
travel-time for the hound.

Driven off by a target, a hound of Tindalos usually gives 
up.  Unfortunately,  such  a  creature  is  difficult  to  drive  off. 
Friends who come to a target’s aid may also become known 
by the creature, and so will be pursued and attacked.

SPECIAL POWERS

Spells: Each hound knows at least 1D8 spells.

Hound of Tindalos

Harvey Walters  has  found  a  mysterious  gem  which, 
when  meditated  upon,  allows  him  to  see  into  the 
distant past. He looks 3,000,000,000 years back, sees 
a  hound  of  Tindalos,  and  is  seen  as  well!  Though 
Harvey faints, breaking the connection, the hound of 
Tindalos is out for blood! The travel time for the crea-
ture is about 30 days. Harvey has a month to prepare 
for an unwelcome visitor.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 1
Fighting attacks: A hound may use its paws or its bite to attack. A 
hound of Tindalos is covered with a sort of bluish pus (Ichor). 
When  a  victim  is  struck  by  a  Fighting  attack,  a  gout  of  this 
mucoid  stuff  is  smeared  over  him  or  her.  This  pus-like  stuff 
is alive and active; doing 2D6 damage to the target, and new 
damage is done in the same amount for each round that the 
ichor  remains  on  the  victim’s  body.  The  ichor  can  be  wiped 
off with a rag or towel with a DEX roll. It could also be rinsed 
off with water or some other agent. Fire would kill the ichor, 
though 1D6 hit points would be lost to burns from the flame.
Tongue: Once per round, with a successful tongue attack, a deep 
penetrating  (though  bloodless  and  painless)  hole  is  formed. 
The  victim  takes  no  physical  damage,  despite  the  peculiar 
wound, but loses 3D6 POW permanently.

The twisting, curving, corkscrew towers of the city of 
Tindalos  are  now  all  but  forgotten.  Ancient  writings 
describe  the  city  as  existing  on  Earth,  although  it  is 
also  said  that  Great  Tindalosi  was  (and  perhaps  still 
is) sited far out in the galaxy near to an abyssal void 
(perhaps a black hole?). Whispered rumors tell of foul 
magicks and unnatural science that brought about the 
conception of the hounds of Tindalos and the destruc-
tion of those who created them.

Hunting Horror

Hunting Horror
And in the air about him were great viperine creatures, which 
had curiously distorted heads, and grotesquely great clawed 
appendages, supporting themselves with ease by the aid of 
black rubbery wings of singularly monstrous dimensions.

—August Derleth, The Lurker at the Threshold

Resembling  enormous  ropy  black  serpents  or  worms 
possessing  bat-like  or  umbrella-like  wings,  the  form  of  a 
hunting  horror  continually  shifts  and  changes,  twitching 
and writhing, so it is hard to look at them. They may have 
only a single large wing rather than two. They speak in great 
harsh voices. A hunting horror’s length averages forty feet.

These beings are dispelled by daylight. A strong enough 
burst of light (from a nuclear reaction, perhaps) could sear 
one  to  dust.  Hunting  horrors  move  swiftly  and  are  harri-
er-creatures for some of the gods, particularly Nyarlathotep. 
They can be summoned in their own right and sent to seek 
out blood and lives.

“Invisible ones from the stars.” These latter, he said were 
definitely aliens on our earth, and the chief among them 
was called Ghatanothoa, the dark one. They sometimes 
took forms, such as the monster on the tablet—who was a 
representation of Ghatanothoa—but existed as vortices of 
power in their natural state.

The  twin  of  Zhar,  Lloigor  or  Lloigornos,  should  not  be 
confused with this race.

They  are  vortices  of  power  in  natural  form  and  com-
pletely invisible to human eyes. On rare occasions they can 
create tangible, visible bodies for themselves. Such bodies are 
monstrous and bear some resemblance to enormous reptiles, 
though  inspection  reveals  their  utter  dissimilarity  to  any 
reptiles that ever walked the face of the Earth.

The  minds  of  lloigor  are  not  divided  into  layers  of 
consciousness. Lloigor do not forget, nor do they have 
imaginations or subconscious to mislead or dis-
tract them. Their outlook of absolute pessimism 
results  in  a  pervading  atmosphere  of  gloom 
that makes lloigor minds and actions incom-
prehensible  to  humans.  Mind-contact 
with  lloigor  always  leads  to  suicidal 
depression for the human partners.

Fighting  attacks:  Lloigor  can  attack  in  many  ways,  including 
strikes, claw, and bite attacks while in reptilian form. Otherwise, 
they may use one of their special powers or a vortex attack.
Vortex Attack:  The  lloigor’s  most  fearsome  weapon  is  a  type  of 
implosion sounding like the roll of distant thunder. Things in 
the  blast  area  are  torn  to  pieces  and  the  ground  is  ruptured. 
At least 100 magic points are needed for an area ten meters in 
diameter. Everything within the circle loses 1D100 hit points. 
Alert  investigators  may  notice  the  tell-tale  effects  of  swirling 
lines appearing in the air and a half-unheard throbbing noise 
penetrating their bodies.

contact costs 1/1D4 Sanity points.

Cases of "lost time" have been reported in locales close 
to the lairs of lloigor. Such instances seem to carry com-
mon features including a general lethargy in the adult 
populace  and  individuals  displaying  acute  narcolepsy, 
with  a  tendency  to  describe  long  periods  of  lost  time 
where  they  cannot  remember  what  has  happened  to 
them. At one moment the individual remembers walk-
ing along a country lane, only to then find that he or 
she is standing atop a cliff with no memory of traveling 
there. In recent times, such instances have at times been 
attributed to UFO "close encounter" phenomena. 

It is believed that the lloigor originally came to Earth from 
the Andromeda galaxy and that their first earthly colony was 
on a lost continent somewhere in the Indian Ocean, possibly 
the same sunken continent that now bears the city of R’lyeh 
and  its  star-spawn  with  it.  The  lloigor  used  human  slaves 
to  perform  their  will  and  used  cruel  disciplines  to  control 
recalcitrant slaves, such as amputating limbs or causing can-
cer-like tentacular growths to sprout on them. Earthly lloigor 
continued to decay and decline, and they retreated under the 
earth and seas, where they still husband their failing energies.
Wales, Rhode Island, and Iraq are places where lloigor are 
known to have acted in recent memory. They are hinted at 
in the folklore of Haiti, Polynesia, and Massachusetts. Some 
Lloigor  are  linked  with  the  Great  Old  One  Ghatanothoa, 
while others may have connections to or worship Ithaqua.

SPECIAL POWERS

Drain Magic Points from Humans: Typically, lloigor human 
servants come from families with histories of mental instabil-
ity. The lloigor need humans to survive, as these immaterial 
entities must draw energy from intelligent beings to perform 
necessary tasks. By expending one of its own magic points a 
lloigor may drain 1D6 magic points (per night) from a sleep-
ing human to use in performing some magical action. A lloi-
gor can drain energy from several sleeping humans at once, 
from up to several miles away despite intervening obstacles. 

The  next  morning,  the  victims  wake  complaining  of 
headaches and a bad night's sleep. With continued draining, 
such  individuals  become  physically  and  spiritually  weak, 
leading to sickness and possibly death. Whenever a victim 
is drained of any magic points by lloigor in this way, a CON 
roll  (at  Regular  difficulty  level)  must  be  made  before  any 
magic points can be recovered. If the CON roll succeeds, the 
victim regains 1 magic point and wakes. If the roll is failed 
no magic points are recovered and the victim continues to 
sleep, whereupon the lloigor may drain another 1D6 magic 
points from the victim over the next hour, after which an-
other CON roll is attempted, and so on.

Telekinetic Effects: The lloigor can push people and manipu-
late objects such as a compass needle or a door latch via tele-
kinesis. The (presumably immaterial) lloigor must be directly 
present and within a few yards of the effect. It takes 10 magic 
points to create a telekinetic force of STR 5 above ground, 6 
magic points to create telekinesis of STR 5 in a subsurface but 
open area, such as a river bed or canyon, and 3 magic points 
to cause telekinesis of STR 5 in a tunnel or cave. A group of 
lloigor  might  combine  telekinesis,  increase  the  STR  of  the 
effect and so perform potent deeds.

Reptilian Manifestation: To take the shape of a monstrous 
distorted reptile, a lloigor must expend magic points equal 
to one-fifth of the lloigor’s SIZ. Once the body is formed, it 
may  be  maintained  indefinitely  or  dissolved  at  will.  If  the 
lloigor is slain in reptile form, it dies permanently. Several 
lloigor may combine their magic points to permit a single 
one  to  create  a  physical  form  quickly.  A  lloigor  in  reptile 
form  has  all  the  powers  of  one  in  the  immaterial  mode, 
except that it cannot pass through walls and is not invisible.

Call of CthulhuMi-Go, the Fungi from Yuggoth

They were pinkish things about five feet long; with crusta-
ceous bodies bearing vast pairs of dorsal fins or membranous 
wings and several sets of articulate limbs, and with a sort of 
convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of very short 
antenna, where a head would ordinarily be. . .  
Sometimes they walked on all their legs and s 
ometimes on the hind-most pair only.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Whisperer in Darkness

The  fungi  from  Yuggoth  are  an  interstellar  race,  with  a 
large  colony  or  base  on  the  planet Yuggoth  (Pluto).  There 
are  mining  colonies  in  the  mountains  of  Earth,  where  the 
mi-go seek rare metallic ores. The mi-go are not animal in 
physiology, being more akin to a form of fungus. They com-
municate  with  each  other  by  changing  the  colors  of  their 
brain-like heads; however, they can speak human tongues in 
buzzing, insect-like voices. 

Unable to eat terrene food, the mi-go must import theirs 
from other worlds. They are able to fly through the interstel-
lar aether on their great wings, though Earth’s atmosphere 
makes their flying maneuverability clumsy at best. 

Some  speculate  that  the  mi-go  are  pan-dimensional 
beings, as their bodies seem to resonate at unusual frequen-
cies; this becomes most apparent when trying to capture the 
creatures on film, as ordinary photographic plates will not 
take an image of these beings. Possibly, modern high-defi-
nition digital video or first-rate chemistry could devise an 
emulsion that might work, however no one having achieved 
such success has ever come forward. 

When injured, the beings seem able to either regrow or 
attach new limbs as needed. After death, a mi-go dissolves 
into a pool of translucent goo within a few hours. This goo 
quickly dries out, leaving only an oily stain.

The  mi-go  worship  both  Nyarlathotep  and  Shub-Nig-
gurath,  and  possibly  others.  They  hire  or  compel  human 
agents to simplify and front their operations on Earth and, 
consequently, are sometimes connected to cults. Occasional 
sightings  in  remote  places  have  become  the  source  of  the 
Abominable  Snowman  stories  told  in  the  Himalayas,  as 
well as perhaps the truth behind supposed encounters with 
aliens or flying saucers. 

Mi-go  are  inquisitive  scientists,  capable  of  astounding 
surgical feats, including the placing of living human brains 
in life-sustaining metal tubes. They can then attach speaking, 
listening, and seeing devices to the tubes, so that the brains 
can interact with those around them. Such contained brains 
may then be carried around and taken into the vacuum and 
cold  of  space,  allowing  their  favored  human  servants  the 
opportunity to visit distant stars and other mi-go outposts. 

SPECIAL POWERS

Hypnosis:  By  introducing  ultra-high  and  ultra-low  fre-
quency  tones  into  its  buzzing,  the  mi-go  can  put  one  or 
many humans listening to it into a trance state. Those with-
in forty-feet of a buzzing mi-go must succeed in an opposed 
POW roll or become incapable of action. Mi-go can speak 

Mi-Go

telepathically to humans, which costs 1 magic  point per 5 
rounds. The human can resist the communication with an 
opposed POW roll.

Void  Light:  Creates  a  sink  from  which  photons  will  not 
emerge.  The  mi-go  must  spend  1  magic  point  for  every 
cubic  yard  of  blackness  desired.  No  light  can  escape  the 
affected  area,  making  a  useful  visual  protection  for  these 
fragile aliens. The darkness may be like a sheet or a spherical 
volume.

Spells: Mi-go have a 25% chance of knowing 1D3 spells.

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsNightgaunt
Shocking and uncouth black things with smooth, 
oily, whale-like surfaces, unpleasant horns that 
curved inward toward each other, bat wings 
whose beating made no sound, ugly prehensile 
paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly 
and disquietingly. And worst of all, they 
never spoke or laughed, and never smiled 
because they had no faces at all to smile 
with, but only a suggestive blankness 
where a face ought to be. All they ever 
did was clutch and fly and tickle; that 
was the way of nightgaunts.
—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dream-Quest 
of Unknown Kadath

Nightgaunts  are  creatures  of  the  Dreamlands  that  serve 
Nodens by, among other things, grasping and carrying off 
intruders,  who  are  unceremoniously  dumped  in  the  most 
dismal and horrible places imaginable, and left to die. Night-
gaunts are stationed at various spots in the lonely parts of 
the Dreamlands, coming out at night to seek their prey. 

In  primeval  times  they  dwelled  in  the  Waking  World 
as well, and some suggest that may still be the case. While 
not very intelligent, nightgaunts can understand some lan-
guages (such as the gibberings of ghouls) and are friendly to 
some occult races.

ATTACKS

Fighting attacks: They attack with their paws, tail, horns, or limbs. 
Seize  (mnvr):  Nightgaunts  favor  seizing  their  opponents  after 
which they can tickle them with their barbed tail. Nightgaunts 
usually attack en masse, attempting to sneak up quietly on vic-
tims, grasp their weapons, and overpower them. Two or more 
nightgaunts may combine their attacks to get hold of a strong 
victim (potentially granting the outnumbered bonus die).
Tickle:  Nightgaunts  may  only  tickle  foes  who  have  already  been 
seized. A successful tickling attack is extremely unnerving, for 
the barb of their tail is razor-sharp and perilous even while its 
light application does no damage—the target becomes bewil-
dered, humiliated, and disoriented, suffering a penalty die on 
all rolls for 1D4 rounds or until the tickling stops. Nightgaunt 
tails can snake through holes and openings, slice through thick 
clothes, and find even the interstices of metal armor.

Rat-Thing 

The bones of the tiny paws, it is 
rumoured, imply prehensile charac-
teristics more typical of a diminutive 
monkey than of a rat; while the small 
skull with its savage yellow fangs is 

of the utmost anomalousness, appearing from  
certain angles like a miniature, monstrously degraded  
parody of a human skull.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dreams in the Witch House

Resembling  ordinary  rats  and  easily  mistaken  for  them  at 
a distance. However close-up, the head of a rat-thing is an 
evil caricature of a human head, and their paws are like tiny 
human hands. All have extremely strong, sharp teeth. 

These unnatural creatures are possibly created by malign 
sorcery.  Sometimes  a  faithful  servant  may  be  transformed 
into a rat-thing, and thus continue to serve his or her mas-
ter. It is said such abominations are wise in the lore of the 
Mythos and may be gifted as familiars to witches and sor-
cerers beloved of the dark gods. Brown Jenkin, the familiar 
of Keziah Mason, the witch, was a rat-thing.

SPECIAL POWERS

Spells:  Rat-things  have  a  30%  chance  of  knowing  1D3 
spells; those who knew spells in life retain that knowledge 
as rat-things. If the rat-thing is a gift from an Outer God or 
some-such entity, it is likely to know many more spells.

Serpent People
They walked lithely and sinuously erect on pre-mammalian 
members, their pied and hairless bodies bending with great 
suppleness. There was a loud hissing of formulae  
as they went to and fro.
—Clark Ashton Smith, The Seven Geases

Serpent  people  resemble  upright  serpents  with  ophidian 
heads  and  scales,  a  tail,  and  two  arms  and  legs.  A  refined 
and cultured race, often met dressed in robes. Yig is revered 
above all other gods of the serpent people, for he is the fa-
ther of all snakes. In ancient times, some blasphemers chose 
instead  to  pray  to  Tsathoggua—they  were  destroyed  by  a 
vengeful god millions of years ago and it is doubtful whether 
any such outcasts remain to peddle their false litanies.

The  serpent  people’s  first  kingdom, Valusia,  flourished 
before even dinosaurs walked the Earth, some two hundred 
and  seventy-five  million  years  ago.  They  built  black  basalt 
cities and fought wars, all in the Permian era or before. They 
were then great sorcerers devoting much energy to calling 
forth  dreadful  demons  and  brewing  potent  poisons.  With 
the coming of the dinosaurs, two hundred and twenty-five 
million years ago, the first kingdom fell and serpent people 
retreated  to  strongholds  far  underground,  the  greatest  of 
which was Yoth. In these times the serpent people became 
great scientists as well, able to manipulate life itself.

In  human  prehistory  the  serpent  people  raised  their 
second kingdom at the center of the Thurian continent. It 
fell even more rapidly than the first Valusia, overthrown this 
time by humans, who later claimed the land as their own. 
Again and again the serpent people retreated before the hu-
man hordes until their last citadel of Yanyoga was destroyed 
in 10,000 B.C.

A few lurking remnants of the race survive, as do pock-
ets of dwarfed degenerates. These diminutions are likely to 
include an occasional atavistic, fully capable serpent person 
who  is  still  favored  by Yig.  Degenerate  serpent  people  are 
likely to have characteristics lessened by as much as a third. 
In addition there are certain hibernating serpent people—
the  sleepers—who  have  rested  for  thousands  of  years  or 
more. On occasion these serpent people wake, to humanity’s 
regret.  This  third  class  of  serpent  people  is  typically  more 
intelligent and powerful than  their  lurking  brothers, often 
retaining the knowledge and ability to cast great sorcery.

Tearing away a rat-thing costs an additional 1D3 hit points to 
the unfortunate victim.

Sand-Dweller
Then out of one of the caves came a Sand-Dweller—rough-
skinned, large-eyed, large-eared, with a horrible, distorted 
resemblance to the koala bear facially, though his body had 
an appearance of emaciation. He shambled  
toward me, manifestly eager.

—H.P. Lovecraft and August Derleth, The Gable Window

This  obscure  race  look  as  though  they  are  encrusted  with 
sand. They dwell in caverns deep in desert areas and come 
out  at  night  to  prowl  and  hunt  for  prey.  They  are  known 
to  live  in  the American  South West  and  may  live  in  other 
deserts  of  the  world  as  well.  They  are  known  to  serve  the 
Great Old Ones.

Toad-like creatures which seemed constantly to be changing

— August Derleth, The Lurker at the Threshold

Vaguely resembling frogs, as well as squids or octopi, these 
amorphous beings progress by rolling, slithering, or lurch-
ing. Their ever-changing shapes are a blasphemous contor-
tion, making description somewhat difficult. 

Servitors accompany their masters as required, though they 
are most commonly found in Azathoth’s court. These are the 
demon flautists that play the flute-like music for their masters

Insect from Shaggai

Shaggai, Insects from

Even though they flew so fast I could, with the augmented 
perception of terror, make out many more details than I 
wished. Those huge lidless eyes which stared in hate at me, 
the jointed tendrils which seemed to twist from the head 
in cosmic rhythms, the ten legs, covered with black shining 
tentacles and folded into the pallid underbelly, and the 
semi-circular ridged wings covered with triangular scales—
all this cannot convey the soul-ripping horror of the shape 
which darted at me. I saw the three mouths of the thing move 
moistly, and then it was upon me.
—Ramsey Campbell, The Insects from Shaggai

These para-dimensional insect-beings never feed (if they do 
it is by some strange method such as photosynthesis), and 
they spend their time in decadence, in aesthetic enjoyment 
of abnormality coupled with a lust for causing pain upon 
others  (usually  through  the  torture  of  their  many  slave 
races). 

Shans, as they are also known, are extremely long-lived, 
taking  centuries  to  reach  adulthood.  As  a  race,  they  are 
scientifically advanced, having access to many weapons and 
devices that operate by focused mind-power (magic points). 
The  shan  worship Azathoth  with  many  complex  rites  and 
systems of torment.

Shans  are  now  a  fugitive  race.  Shaggai  itself  was  de-
stroyed by a great catastrophe, however many shan escaped 
in temples made of an indestructible grey metal, teleporting 
them  to  other  worlds,  including  Earth.  However,  Earth’s 
atmosphere  contains  a  certain  a  component  that  prevents 
the shan from teleporting away. This unknown component 
also stops individual shan from flying any great distance.

Trapped, the insect-beings now dwelling on Earth have 
brought slave beings from the planet Xiclotl as guards. Over 
the  centuries  the  shan  have  manipulated  and  possessed 
small  numbers  of  humans  to  advance  their  alien  agenda. 
At  one  time  they  ruled  a  human  witch-cult  dedicated  to 
finding sacrifices for Azathoth, while in more modern times 
it is suggested that they have begun to infiltrate pockets of 
political  power.  The  largest  colony  of  shan  is  rumored  to 
exist near Goatswood, a village of England’s Severn Valley. 

SPECIAL POWERS

Mental Attack: Shans are parasitic and not wholly material. 
One of these  bird-sized creatures can fly right through hu-
man tissue into a target’s brain, wherein it crawls about and 
reads its host’s memories, affects thought processes and in-
jects specific memories and ideas of its own. During the day, 
the  insect  is  not  active  within  the  brain,  leaving  the  victim 
to do more or less as he or she pleases. However at night the 
shan  wakes  and  begins  to  implant  memories—effectively 

pre-programming the host to do its bidding. It can implant 
sanity-destroying  sights,  which  the  insect  has  witnessed,  or 
riddle memory-fragments to entice the victim into perform-
ing certain actions. Eventually the host is so hypnotized that 
he or she gladly (knowingly or unknowingly) helps the shan. 
Often such progressively increasing control causes the victim 
to go raving mad, and thus become an unsuitable host.

Spells: Shan have an 80% chance of knowing 2D10 spells, 
usually including Call Azathoth.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 1
Fighting attacks: An insect from Shaggai relies on either its nerve-
whip or on its ability to possess the target (meld) and has no 
innate Fighting skill otherwise.

Nerve Whip: The nerve whip is a small technical device that proj-
ects  a  chattering  line  of  pallid  light. When  the  light  strikes  a 
target, make an opposed POW roll. If the shan wins, the target 
is overcome by agony and can do nothing but writhe on the 
ground until the weapon is turned off. If the attack fails, the 
target  is  still  in  pain  and  all  rolls  are  made  with  one  penalty 
die for a number of hours equal to 24 minus one-fifth of the 
victim’s CON. The attack may be renewed each round and the 
penalties are cumulative.

Meld: This represents the shan’s chance to fly into a human’s head 

and stay there.

Nerve Whip 50% (25/10), damage special
Meld 60% (30/12), no damage, however the insect gains progres-

sive control after it enters the brain of target

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsShantak

It is believed that shantaks provide service for Nylar-
thotep  and  perhaps  also  for  the  Wendigo  (Ithaqua), 
although such rumors are rife with misleading informa-
tion. The Book of Eibon recounts how a shantak was 
summoned to act as a steed; however, once the jour-
ney had begun, the creature took no heed of its sum-
moner’s commands and instead attempted to travel to 
the court of Azathoth. Only quick thinking, resulting 
in the killing of the shantak, saved the traveler from a 
hideous fate.

Shantak

Not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth…for they 
were larger than elephants and had heads like a horse’s…The 
Shantak-bird has scales instead of feathers and those scales 
are very slippery.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath

Shantaks  brood  in  cavernous  holes  and  their  wings  are 
encrusted  with  rime  and  nitre.  They  are  always  described 
as noisome and loathly, and are often used as steeds by the 
servants of the Outer Gods. They have an extreme fear of 
nightgaunts and always retreat from them. 

Shantaks  can  fly  through  space  and  have  been  known 
to carry an unwary rider straight to the throne of Azathoth.

Shoggoth
The nightmare, plastic column of fetid, black iridescence oozed 
tightly onward…A shapeless congerie of protoplasmic bubbles, 
faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes 
forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light all over 
the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the 
frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it 
and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter. Still came that 
eldritch mocking cry—”Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”

—H.P. Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness

Shoggoths are among the most horrible and loathsome of 
Mythos monsters. Mighty sacks of protoplasm, roughly 15-
feet in diameter, these amphibious creatures are able to form 
limbs, eyes, and other appendages at will, imitate other life 
forms, and perform great feats of strength. They communi-
cate in whatever manner their master race wishes, forming 
special organs for the purpose.

Despite  Abdul  Alhazred's  claims  that  there  were  none 
on Earth itself, save in the crazed nightmares of dreamers, 
shoggoths do exist in deep and dark places. Often found as 
servants of deep ones and other races, they are surly at best, 
ever becoming more intelligent, more rebellious, and more 
imitative. Their creators, the ancient elder things, found to 
their cost the true nature of their servants in a rebellion that 
virtually destroyed their civilization.

Call of CthulhuShoggoth

Shoggoth Lord

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 2
Fighting  attacks:  In  combat,  a  shoggoth  covers  an  area  5  yards 
square and is able to produce tentacles, claws, or any manner 
of appendages at will with which to perform a crushing attack. 
Those unfortunate enough to be hit by a shoggoth attack may 
also be engulfed.

Engulf: Each person engulfed within the shoggoth is attacked sepa-
rately and each must make a successful opposed STR roll or be 
sucked apart. If the shoggoth attacks more than one target, it 
must divide its STR among all targets. 

Those  held  within  the  shoggoth’s  black  bulk  can  strike  back  only 
on rounds in which they successfully roll STR or less on 1D100. 
Each round a victim is held within a shoggoth, he or she loses 
hit  points  equal  to  the  shoggoth’s  damage  bonus;  the  damage 
describable as rupturing, crushing, and being sucked into pieces. 
A  shoggoth  can  engulf  any  number  of  enemies;  however  they 
may not exceed a total SIZ greater than its own SIZ.

Fighting  70%  (35/14),  damage  equals  damage  bonus  or  it  can 

choose to engulf the target (see above)

Dodge: 8% (4/1)
Armor: None, but (1) fire and electrical attacks do only half dam-
age; (2) physical weapons such as firearms and knives do only 1 
point of damage per hit; (3) a shoggoth regenerates 2 hit points 
per round.

Sanity Loss: 1D6/1D20 Sanity points to see a shoggoth.

As the science of genetics grows from infancy to matu-
rity, the day may come when experiments reveal a hith-
erto unknown code in the cells of all living things on 
Earth. The code, when activated, causes cells to modify, 
allowing a hybridized and rapid evolution never before 
seen  in  nature—with  flesh  instantaneously  adapting 
to  changing  environments.  Will  mankind  welcome  or 
revolt in horror at the shoggoth within us all?

Shoggoth  Lords  are  smaller,  more  intelligent  descendants 
of their larger monstrous cousins. Through some quirk of 
evolution, or perhaps through the unwitting intervention of 
some  other  species  or  being,  a  handful  of  shoggoths  have 
evolved into intelligent creatures able at will to mimic hu-
mans in appearance and speech.

These  beings,  without  exception,  appear  in  human 
form  as  grossly  obese,  hairless  figures.  They  are  cunning 
and  charming,  and  somewhat  awkward  in  their  interac-
tions  with  humans.  Although  a  shoggoth  lord  may  freely 
transmute  between  its  human  and  monstrous  forms,  it 
takes great concentration and control to remain in human 
form for any length of time. If somehow caught off-guard, 
angered, or distracted, a shoggoth lord quickly melts down 
into  its  terrible  true  gelatinous  self.  These  creatures  guard 
their secrets and identities well, living and feeding alone in 
private  and  quickly  dispatching  nosey  investigators  who 
would unmask them and expose their true horror.

Shoggoth lords find it amusing (and nourishing) to pen-
etrate the human world; only in human beings do they find 
that delightful horror of comprehension that makes a thing 
really worth eating. Shoggoth lords care only about satisfying 
themselves. Though more sophisticated than most predators, 
they are given to the same grandiose claims of territory and to 
murderous squabbles among themselves. They are not social, 
they do not die natural deaths, nor do they breed.

Because  of  the  great  control  required  to  sustain  their 
human guises, certain characteristics in their human form 
are lower than when in their natural state.

SHOGGOTH LORD, Corpulent monstrosities

Shoggoth Lord
You cannot imagine the Shoggoth Lord’s mastery of shapes! His 
race has bred smaller since modern man last met with it. Oh, but 
the Shoggoth Lords are limber now! Supremest polymorph—
though what they are beneath all else, is Horror itself.

ATTACKS

Fighting attacks: A shoggoth lord will attempt to engulf its living 
prey into its bubbling gelatinous body. When it takes prey, it 
seizes and holds its victim as it begins to suck it into its body 
mass, where it can be digested. While being digested, the victim 
suffers 1D6 hit points damage each round from the caustic ac-
ids and digestive fluids breaking down the unfortunate’s body.
Those so held may attempt to break free each round by an opposed 
STR roll. Unlike their larger cousins, shoggoth lords may only 
feed on one victim at a time. While feeding, the shoggoth lord 
may not use its crush attack, although it can still lash out with 
its powerful pseudopod fists.

Fighting  90%  (45/18),  damage  1D6+2  +  damage  bonus  appro-

Star Spawn

Star-Spawn of Cthulhu

They all lay in stone houses in their great city of R’lyeh, 
preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious 
resurrection when the stars and the earth might  
once more be ready…

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu

These  gigantic  octopoid  beings  resemble  Cthulhu  himself, 
yet are smaller in stature. Not all the inhabitants of R’lyeh 
were  trapped  in  its  watery  angles  when  it  sank.  Some  still 
live on in the deep trenches beneath the ocean, where they 
are tended by the deep ones. Related entities also dwell in 
the stars, such as the beings said to infest the Lake of Hali on 
a planet near the star Aldebaran, in Taurus.

Star Vampire

The dim outlines of a presence came into view; the blood-
filled outlines of that unseen shambler from the stars. It was 
red and dripping; an immensity of pulsing, moving jelly; a 
scarlet blob with myriad tentacular trunks that waved and 
wavered. There were suckers on the tips of the appendages, 
and these were opening and closing with ghoulish lust…The 
thing was bloated and obscene; a headless, faceless, eyeless 
bulk with the ravenous maw and titanic talons of a star-born 
monster. The human blood on which it had fed revealed the 
hitherto invisible out-lines of the feaster.

—Robert Bloch, The Shambler from the Stars

308 

Call of CthulhuThese  loathsome  things  are  normally  invisible,  their  pres-
ence  signaled  only  by  a  sort  of  ghoulish  tittering  sound. 
After feeding, they become visible through the blood they 
drink.

Summoned from the depths of space, some can be con-

trolled to serve powerful wizards or other beings.

SPECIAL POWERS

Tcho-Tcho
Our attackers…were a horde of little men, the tallest of them 
no more than four feet, with singularly small eyes set deep 
in dome-like, hairless heads. These…attackers fell upon the 
party and had killed men and animals with their bright 
swords almost before our men could extract their weapons.
—August Derleth and Mark Schorer, The Lair of the Star-Spawn

The blasted Plateau of Tsang in Tibet is claimed to be one 
of the incursions of dread Leng into our space-time. On it 
and in a few other far-removed regions dwell the tribes of 
the tcho-tchos. In the beginnings of time, Chaugnar Faugn 
made a race of beings, the Miri Nigri, to serve him. The Miri 
were a race of dwarfs fashioned from the flesh of primitive 
amphibians. The tcho-tchos are said to come from humans 
who intermingled with the horrible Miri, forming a hybrid 
race of evil intent. Descendants are outwardly human-like, 
and of various sizes and costume, however the taint of the 
Miri curses all tcho-tchos with Half-normal sanity at birth. 
The  remaining  sanity  of  the  tcho-tchos  is  rapidly  eroded 
in a few years by participation in unspeakable ceremonies 
and horrific deeds, while a desire for inflicting cruelty and 
torture upon others becomes second nature.

Differing tcho-tcho tribes worship a variety of Great Old 

Ones, not just Chaugnar Faugn.

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsSection Two: Deities of the 
Mythos
 The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones 
shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but ‘between’ them, They 
walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dunwich Horror

Although many of the alien races of the Cthulhu Mythos are 
terrifying, they are nothing before the might of the Mythos 
gods—immense creatures barely within our scope of under-
standing,  all  the  more  horrifying  for  the  fact  that  they  do 
not care about the fate of humanity.

It  should  also  be  noted  that  many  deities  have  avatars. 
These are specific forms, sometimes with specific attributes, 
in which a portion of a god may appear. Cults often worship 
avatars of gods rather than the gods themselves. Nyarlathotep 
is particularly well known for his thousand avatars (or masks). 
The term deity is used here to mean not only gods but 
those with godlike powers, such as Great Cthulhu himself. 
While Cthulhu is worshipped like a god, many believe him 
to be part of an alien race, though whether his brethren are 
like him or are lesser beings is not made clear. Those such as 
Great Cthulhu may be termed Great Old Ones to distinguish 
them from actual gods as we generally understand the term. 
Some  have  tried  to  define  a  pantheon  of  Mythos  gods  or 
to classify them into a hierarchy, such as Elder Gods, Other 
Gods, Outer Gods, Great Old Ones, and so on. In his writ-
ings, Lovecraft was inconsistent in his use of these entities, 
just as real world myths have inconsistencies and contradic-
tions. As Keeper, you should feel empowered to make your 
own  decisions  about  what  fits  your  story,  and  which  gods 
you  wish  to  use  and  how.  These  matters  are  meant  to  be 
beyond man’s understanding, so to define them too closely 
may prove counterproductive.

Each deity has characteristic values listed, though these 
are often so large when compared with those of an investiga-
tor that they may cease to have any useful relevance. They 
are included only to give a sense of scale and completeness. 
As with monsters, these values may be raised or lowered ac-
cording to the scenario and the Keeper’s requirements.

Remember  that  a  roll  is  not  permitted  if  an  opposing 
characteristic exceeds that of an investigator by 100 or more.
This will often be the case with deities. 

Note, though, that these deities are not omnipotent and 
that  many  can  be  physically  assaulted  and  driven  back  (if 
not  killed),  as  happens  to  Great  Cthulhu  in  the  story  The 
Call of Cthulhu.

Dodge skill: When would a god need to dodge an inves-

tigator? The Dodge skill has been omitted from gods. 

Outnumbered  bonus:  This  is  never  granted  when  in 

combat with a deity.

When Facing a God
A god is going to regard an investigator as a human might 
regard an insect. Do you know the name of a particular ant 
that lives in your garden? Does an ant have the intellect or 
power to affect you? You might flick an insect away if it lands 
on you, but would you hunt it down? 

When humans are in the presence of a god it is unlikely 
that the god will even notice them. Perhaps it would tread 
on them as we might tread on an ant.

Abhoth
He descried…in the pool a grayish, horrid mass that nearly 
choked it from rim to rim. Here, it seemed, was the ultimate 
source of all miscreation and abomination. For the gray mass 
quobbed and quivered, and swelled perpetually; and from it, 
in manifold fission, were spawned the anatomies that crept 
away on every side through the grotto.

—Clark Ashton Smith, The Seven Geases

Manifestly not native to this planet, Abhoth’s protean form 
and cynical mind imply relation to Tsathoggua. The black 
caverns wherein it dwells and which it never leaves may well 
be  part  of  N’Kai,  an  underground  world  beneath  North 
America. Some reports place these caverns directly beneath 
the New England village of Dunwich.

Cult
Abhoth  has  no  known  human  worshipers.  Underground 
horrors or Abhoth’s own spawn may worship it.

Other Characteristics
Obscene  monsters  constantly  form  in  the  grey  mass  and 
crawl away from their parent. Abhoth’s tentacles and limbs 
grasp  many  offspring  and  devour  them  again,  returning 
them  to  the  primal  mass,  but  more  manage  to  escape.  If 
someone  nears  Abhoth,  the  various  monstrous  spawn, 
which continually detach from its body, become more nu-
merous, and these may harry or attack investigators. 

Spawn  of  Abhoth  are  manifold  and  varied  in  appear-
ance; particulars are best left to the Keeper. Its spawn are no 
larger than SIZ 5 to 90 (3D6 x 5), at least at first—after a year 
or so of feeding and growing, a spawn may be of any size.

spider-god hates leaving its eternal work of spinning. 

The children of Atlach-Nacha in the Dreamlands—called 

the Leng Spiders—are known to worship Atlach-Nacha.

Other Characteristics
Whoever  stumbles 
into  Atlach-Nacha’s  web  becomes 
trapped.  The  web  has  STR  150  against  which  any  victim 
must roll to escape. In an hour or a day, Atlach-Nacha ap-
pears to dispose of the captive.

The  spider  god  can  first  fling  more  strands  over  the 
victim and then bite, or it can bite at once. When it bites, it 
injects a paralyzing poison, leaving the victim incapable of 
action or defense.

Atlach-Nacha then sucks the victim’s body juices at the 
rate  of  3D10  STR  per  combat  round.  If  uncared-for,  the 
husk soon dies. If rescued, the victim’s STR returns at a rate 
of  2D10  points  per  game  month  of  bed-rest.  During  this 
time the victim’s hit points can never exceed one-fifth of his 
or her STR.

the intruders and then drop off and crawl away. The visitor

Atlach-Nacha

A darksome form, big as a crouching man but with long 
spider-like members…He saw that there was a kind of face 
on the squat ebon body, low down amid the several-jointed 
legs. The face peered up with a weird expression of doubt 
and inquiry; and terror crawled through the veins of the bold 
huntsman as he met the small, crafty eyes t 
hat were circled about with hair.

—Clark Ashton Smith, The Seven Geases

Atlach-Nacha  superficially  resembles  a  huge  and  hideous 
black  hairy  spider  with  a  strange,  remotely  human  face, 
and little red eyes rimmed with hair. It lives underground, 
eternally  spinning  a  fantastic  web,  bridging  an  immeasur-
ably deep chasm for unknown purposes. Old books cite the 
belief that when the web is completed, the end of the world 
will come. In the remote past Atlach-Nacha’s dwelling was 
far beneath the continent of Hyperborea—modern Green-
land. Now it may dwell beneath South America.

Cult
Atlach-Nacha is superstitiously believed to rule all spiders, 
perhaps  because  of  its  body  form.  It  has  no  cult  among 
humans,  however  it  sometimes  grants  sorcerers  spells  and 
POW. Sorcerers sometimes summon Atlach-Nacha via var-

Some  say  that  Azathoth  begat  the  universe  and  that 
he is also its end—the very primal chaos from which 
all  matter  and  life  began.  Thus  is  the  power  of  that 
which  lies  at  the  center  of  reality  that  many  seekers 
of forbidden knowledge have been driven mad in the 
pursuit of his secret name—a name said to hold sway 
and power over ‘those from outside’.

Azathoth

Azathoth
That last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which 
blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity—the 
boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips 
dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, 
unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled, 
maddening beating of vile drums and the thin  
monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath

Azathoth is the ruler of the Gods, and has existed since the 
beginning of the universe. It dwells beyond normal space-
time  at  the  center  of  the  universe,  where  its  amorphous 
body  writhes  unceasingly  to  the  monotonous  piping  of  a 
flute. Lesser gods dance mindlessly round Azathoth to the 
same music. Azathoth is described as both blind and idiotic, 
a  “monstrous  nuclear  chaos.”  The  urges  of  Azathoth  are 
immediately fulfilled by Nyarlathotep.

Cult
Azathoth  is  little-worshiped,  for  the  god  offers  not  even 
gratitude in return. Usually humans call upon Azathoth by 
accident, and thereby unwittingly bring disaster and horror. 
Only the criminally insane would knowingly worship such 
a being. Nonetheless, such worshipers may have special in-
sights into the nature of the universe, its origin, powers, and 
meaning,  insights  perhaps  understandable  only  by  other 
madmen.

Other Characteristics
Azathoth  always  manifests  with  a  servitor  flautist  to  play 
its music, and 1D10–1 Lesser Other Gods. Summoners risk 
Azathoth  striking  out  in  irritation,  the  percentile  chance 
equal  to  100%  minus  ten  percentiles  for  each  Other  God 
who  arrived,  and  minus  another  five  percentiles  for  each 
magic  point  that  the  sorcerer  expends  to 
placate  the  god.  The  magic  points  sacri-
ficed must be renewed each round. 

If  angered,  Azathoth  grows:  on 

the  first  round  that  it  attacks,  it  also 
burgeons  out  from  its  summoned 
confines,  and  its  pseudopods  have 
a  reach  of  50  yards.  On  the  second 
combat  round  it  has  a  reach  of  100 
yards,  the  third  round  giving  it 
200  yards,  and  so  on,  doubling 
each round indefinitely.

Call of CthulhuBast
Beauty—coolness—aloofness—philosophic repose—self-suf-
ficiency—untamed mastery—where else can we find these 
things with even half the perfection and completeness that 
mark their incarnation in the peerless and softly gliding cat?
—H.P. Lovecraft, Cats and Dogs

Bast, the Cat Goddess, is represented as a cat or as a woman 
with a cat’s head. In ancient Egypt she was often shown with 
a  sistrum  in  her  right  hand,  an  aegis  surmounted  with  a 
lion’s head in her left hand, and a small bag slung over her 
left arm. She is also called Bastet or Ubasti. Bast may have 
dominion only over Earth and its dreamlands, for the cats of 
Saturn in the Dreamlands are inimical to Earth’s cats.

Cult
The  goddess  of  ancient  Bubastis,  in  Egypt,  Bast’s  cult 
eventually came to major Roman cities, including Pompeii. 
When she was actively worshiped, she was both a 
deity of the home and a lioness war goddess. Her 
worshipers  always  regarded  her  affectionately. 
Her  cult  seems  not  to  have  survived  among 
humans,  except  in  the  Dreamlands,  but  she 
may  not  care.  All  cats  worship  her  in  their 
savage hearts.

Other Characteristics
Like the other gods, Bast rarely takes action. 
If a person is remarkably cruel to cats, she 
may  act  through  her  feline  minions.  If 
they  cannot  solve  the  difficulty  she 
may come personally. She always ap-
pears  with  an  entourage  of  large, 
sleek  felines—mostly  house  cats, 
but  including  at  least  one  lioness, 

tigress, or other big cat.

Bast

Bast  commands  all  felines,  any-
where in the world. She can summon any num-

ber of cats, but they must travel normally to her. 

She may heal damage to herself or to a cat by expending 

one magic point per point of damage.

Despite  a  purge  of  the  Bast  cult  within  the  city  of 
Bubastis, it is believed that a few individuals escaped 
with  their  lives,  rituals,  and  devotions  to  England. 
Working in secret and recruiting those with a natural 
affinity with cats, the cult grew and spread. Informa-
tion is sketchy; it is believed the cult learned its lesson 
and remained underground, fearful of another purge. 
Whether  the  cult  still  exists  remains  conjecture,  yet 
it  is  written  in  early  accounts  of  folklore  researchers 
of the 1800s that certain rural villages in the west of 
England held many stories concerning cats being the 
predominant familiar of witches and warlocks.

Chaugnar Faugn
The ears were webbed and tentacled, the trunk terminated in 
a huge flaring disk at least a foot in diameter…Its forelimbs 
were bent stiffly at the elbow, and its hands—it had human 
hands—rested palms upward on its lap. Its shoulders were 
broad and square and its breasts and enormous stomach 
sloped outward, cushioning the trunk.
—Frank Belknap Long, The Horror from the Hills

Chaugnar  Faugn  squats  in  a  cave  in  mountainous  Asia, 
guarded  day  and  night  by  subhuman  thralls  only  vaguely 
manlike, who hold rites so foul that none dare describe them. 
Usually Chaugnar Faugn remains immobile on his pedestal, 
a grotesque statue. Legends say that one day the “White Aco-
lyte” will come to bear Chaugnar Faugn to a new land.

Cult
Chaugnar Faugn is primarily worshiped by the subhuman 
tcho-tcho  people  of  the  Tsang  Plateau.  In  addition  he  has 
scattered  cults  among  the  humans  of  central  Asia.  Some 
of  these  have  begun  to  spread,  such  as  The  Blood,  which 
migrated to Montreal, Canada in the 18th century.

Other Characteristics
At  night,  Chaugnar  Faugn  may  stir  and  hungrily  feed  on 
a sacrifice, or upon anyone at hand. Day or night, he may 
lurch from his pedestal to annihilate unbelievers who enter 
his precincts. The disk-like snout at the end of his trunk is 
an organ that drains blood from a victim. Laid on an open 
wound, that wound never heals.

If not hungry, he may merely maul a victim for 1D6 hit 

points damage.

He may choose a human as a companion, and thereafter 
that  mesmerized  person  loses  1D10  Sanity  points  daily 
until  mad.  At  night  Chaugnar  Faugn  lays  his  snout-disk 
on his companion, incidentally inducing the captive’s nose 
and  ears  gradually  to  grow  into  caricatures  of  Chaugnar

Cthugha
But even though we had shielded our eyes, it was impossible 
not to see the great amorphous shapes streaming skyward 
from this accursed place, nor the equally great being hovering 
like a cloud of living fire above the trees.

—August Derleth, The Dweller in Darkness

Cthugha resembles an enormous burning mass, continually 
varying  in  shape.  It  dwells  at  or  near  the  star  Fomalhaut, 
whence it may be called. It is one of the most obscure and 
remote of all the Great Old Ones.

Cult
No  cult  appears  to  be  connected  with  Cthugha,  though 
scattered fire cults to it have existed in the past, such as the 
church of Melkarth in ancient Rome. It is served by entities 
known as fire vampires. In some books, the fire vampires are 
stated to be ruled by a being known as Fthagghua; perhaps 
this is just another way to spell Cthugha.

Other Characteristics
Cthugha has the telepathic abilities common to the deities, 
but  does  not  seem  to  communicate  with  humans  in  any 
fashion and must be summoned to be dealt with.

ing in the round after Cthugha comes. Each round the players 
must attempt to roll CON. Upon failure, the investigator loses 
1 hit point per round until death. The only way to survive is 
to  flee  the  area—a  roughly  circular  area  with  a  diameter  of 
2D10 x 20 yards. Cthugha does not depart until that area has 
been thoroughly blasted and burned, unless first dismissed by 
means of a spell.

314 

Call of Cthulhubut  someday  the  city  will  rise  and  he  will  wake, 
freed to raven and slay across the world. 
In  the  city  are  also  entombed  other 
members of Cthulhu’s race. Cthulhu is 
evidently  the  high  priest  and  ruler  of 
them all, and is by far the most potent.

Cult
Cthulhu’s cult is the most widespread 
and  popular  cult  of  the  earthly  Great 
Old  Ones.  This  cult  believes  that 
Cthulhu  plunged  from  the  stars  with 
his kin and built a great prehistoric city 
at R’lyeh, ruling the world. When the stars 
changed, their continent sank beneath the 
sea, and the city and its inhabitants fell into 
a death-sleep where they await their reawakening 
by  members  of  Cthulhu’s  cult.  When  R’lyeh  rises  above 
the  waves,  members  of  the  cult  will  be  required  to  come 
to  it  and  open  the  vast  black  door  behind  which  Cthulhu 
dreams, whereupon he will awaken and rise to revel across 
the world in wild abandon with the faithful.

Entire tribes are recorded as worshiping Cthulhu. Remote 
Inuits  are  mentioned.  So  are  degenerate  Louisiana  swamp-
folk. He seems to be most worshiped among sea-folk, or be-
ings that live near the sea. He is served by the beings known as 
the deep ones as well as by the octopoid things known as the 
star-spawn  of  Cthulhu.  Cthulhu’s  cult  is  prehistoric  and  of 
many variants, and Cthulhu himself has many names, most 
of which can be traced back to their original form. Thus two 
of his names are Tulu and Thu Thu.

Other Characteristics

Great Cthulhu

Flame Burst: Cthugha may belch forth fire instead of 
using pseudopods. A flame bust has a range 
of  150  yards  and  blankets  the  target 
site  with  fire,  incinerating  an  area  20 
yards  across.  Investigators  within  the 
area  must  attempt  an  Extreme  CON 
roll  (rolling  equal  to  or  below  one-fifth 
of  their  CON):  a  failed  roll  indicates 
incineration. A success indicates 1D10 
hit point loss. Body armor is of no help 
against  this  attack,  but  an  intervening 
wall or embankment would be.

Sanity Loss: 1D3/1D20 Sanity points to see Cthugha.

Cthugha

Although no record remains, the Great Fire of London 
in 1666 is believed in some circles to have started due 
to  an  unwise  ritual  devotion  to  Cthugha  that  took 
place in the cellars of a baker in Pudding Lane. Those 
involved summoned a power far greater than they had 
anticipated, and a legion of flame vampires descended 
in advance of the summoning’s climax. Quickly over-
come, the ritual’s participants fled before the working 
could be undone or contained, and thus within hours 
the entire city was aflame.

Great Cthulhu

A monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an 

octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, 
a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws 
on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings 
behind. This thing…was of a somewhat bloated 
corpulence…It lumbered slobberingly into sight 
and gropingly squeezed its gelatinous green 
immensity through the black doorway… 

A mountain walked or stumbled.

— H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu

Great  Cthulhu’s  body  form  is  not  fixed.  He  can  warp  and 
modify  it  at  will,  extending  new  limbs,  retracting  old  ones, 
greatly increasing his wings’ area and reducing his body’s size 
to enable flight, or elongating a single limb or tentacle to enable 
it to writhe through yards of corridor. However, his overall 
shape  is  tied  to  the  form  described.  Thus  he  might 
expand  or  contract  his  wings,  but  would  never 
completely  absorb  them. All  of  his  forms  are 
recognizable as caricatures of Cthulhu.

Cthulhu dwells in the corpse city of black 
R’lyeh,  sunken  deep  beneath  the  surface  of 
the Pacific. He is in a living death while there, 

315 

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsThe Call of Cthulhu
In the sunken abysmal city of R’lyeh, Cthulhu dreams, 
and such dreams may affect the dreams of men. Cer-
tain sensitive humans have, over the centuries, heard 
this dream call. Often artistic sensibilities are affected, 
causing  the  recipient  to  awake  from  slumber  and  be 
driven to produce nightmarish canvases or sculptures; 
finding no rest until their corrupted works of art have 
been  completed.  Others,  finding  no  vent  for  their 
emotions and dream insights, follow a darker path to 
absolute madness and, sometimes, suicide.

Some  cultists  believe  the  recipients  of  Cthulhu’s 
call  are  honored  and  should  be  held  in  high  regard, 
for they may well speak the echoes of Great Cthulhu’s 
thoughts.  Whether  there  is  intelligence  behind  such 
dream-sending or just the emanations of psychic res-
idue  infecting  the  sensitive  mind  is  unknown.  Either 
way, the results tend to the same: the human’s mind 
is  opened  to  awesome  vistas  of  inhuman  experience 
while  at  the  same  time  comprehending  the  unspeak-
able and implacable intent of dreaming Cthulhu.

The  first  time  a  person  receives  the  dreams  of 
Cthulhu they must make a Sanity roll (1/1D4 loss) and 
each night thereafter. The Keeper should determine the 
length of time over which such dream-sending occurs 
(usually  1D20  days).  As  to  outward  effect  upon  the 
character concerned, it is left to the player and Keeper 
to best decide dependent upon that character’s temper-
ament and artistic skills.

Though in millennial sleep, Cthulhu is known to send hor-
rifying dreams to mortal men, which may have tipped some 
people into madness.

Despite  being  considered  the  largest  and  most  wide-
spread  Mythos  cult,  the  Cthulhu  Cult  is  believed  to 
be  heavily  fragmented;  if  the  research  and  theories 
of Professor Angell are to be taken seriously. While a 
common faith is shared, the methods, practices, and 
dogma  of  differing  sects  appear  to  be  noticeably  at 
odds  with  one  another.  While  some  work  in  silence 
and  shadows,  a  minority  of  others  espouse  a  more 
direct  approach,  working  to  establish  public  bodies, 
such as the Esoteric Order of Dagon, whose proselytiz-
ing condemns mainstream religion. While such sects 
remain  a  fringe  oddity,  it  remains  to  be  seen  if  such 
internal  schism  will  end  in  confrontation,  and  if  so, 
which side will win the day.

Cyaegha

They saw that it was a gigantic eye staring down at them. 
Around the eye, the sky split; deep clefts opened through 
which darkness began to ooze, a darkness blacker than the 
night, which crawled down as a set of slimy tentacles, taking 
on more form, more definite shape…something was standing, 
outlined against the black sky, something which had tentacles 
of darkness and a green-glowing eye.

—Eddy C. Bertin, Darkness, My Name Is

Cyaegha is an enormous black mass with one huge spherical 
green eye. It is possible that Cyaegha’s form is simply that of 
the huge eye surrounded by long tentacles.

Cult
Cyaegha is worshiped by the residents of a small village over 
its resting place in a remote part of western Germany. The 
cult holds human sacrifice; however, Cyaegha cares little for 
worship,  only  for  the  day  of  its  release.  Other,  rural  cults 
may exist elsewhere in Northern Europe.

Some speak of a terrible curse that afflicts those who 
live in isolated areas where the possibility of Cyaegha 
worship exists. It is said that the One in Darkness can 
possess  the  unwary  and  convert  them  to  his  cause. 
This unspeakable hypnotic suggestion appears to start 
in a wayward individual who then slowly converts oth-
ers until a coven or secret group is formed with enough 
members to open a direct channel to their new master. 
Some  tales  speak  of  one  coven  that  was  able  to 
leech  power  and  magical  learning  directly  from  Cy-
aegha.  Their  diabolic  rites  were  not  meant  to  free  or 
empower the god, but rather to syphon-off the god’s 
energies for their own benefit. The tales equally speak 
of a terrible, yet unnamed, doom that came to those 
who practiced this inverted form of worship.

Daoloth
Not shapeless, but so complex that the eye could recognise no 
describable shape. There were hemispheres and shining metal, 
coupled by long plastic rods. The rods were of a flat grey 
colour, so that he could not make out which were nearer; they 
merged into a flat mass from which protruded individual 
cylinders. As he looked at it, he had a curious feeling that eyes 
gleamed from between these rods; but wherever he glanced at 
the construction, he saw only the spaces between them.

—Ramsey Campbell, The Render of the Veils

A strange, geometric being, Daoloth does not appear to be 
particularly malign. It lives somewhere beyond our universe, 
but may be summoned into it.

Cult
Daoloth is currently worshiped on Yuggoth and other alien 
worlds,  but  seems  to  have  little  earthly  cult.  His  astrolo-
ger-priests can see the past and future, and perceive how ob-
jects extend into the last dimension. They gain the power to 
travel into other dimensions and to see other types of reality. 

Seeing Daoloth is disastrous, for the human eye 
is unable to follow the god’s moving outline, 
thus  causing  madness  in  the  beholder. 
Daoloth’s few human cultists summon 
the god only in absolute blackness.

Other Characteristics
The  god’s  presence  causes  disaster 
among  humankind.  If  he  is  not 
carefully held inside some magical 
barrier,  his  form  expands  and 
engulfs  anyone  nearby.  Those  en-
gulfed  by  Daoloth  are  immediately 
sent  to  distant  and  dismal  worlds  or 
alternate  dimensions,  from  which  they 

rarely return.
Daoloth  moves  unconventionally,  either 
by  expanding  his  shape  or  by  slipping  through 
dimensions. He expands at 8 meters radius per round and 
can continue expanding to any size.

Eihort
Then came pale movement in the well, and something clam-
bered up from the dark, a bloated blanched oval supported on 
myriad fleshless legs. Eyes formed in the  
gelatinous oval and stared at him.

—Ramsey Campbell, Before the Storm

Eihort is a monstrous being that lives in a labyrinthine net-
work of tunnels deep beneath England’s Severn Valley.

Cult
Eihort’s  only  known  cults  are  in  the  Severn Valley,  partic-
ularly  in  the  cities  of  Brichester  and  Camside.  Typically  a 
group  of  demented  humans  is  led  by  a  group  of  Eihort’s 
Brood, which have formed themselves into the simulacrum 
of a human.

Other Characteristics
Eihort’s  Brood:  small,  globular,  white  grub-like  or  spi-
der-like creatures, easily slain. Their systematic destruction 
risks Eihort’s wrath. After their grisly birth, the Brood hide 
until the Great Old Ones walk the Earth again. Then they 
will  metamorphose  into  smaller  versions  of  Eihort  and 
thereafter attend him. Brood are not intelligent or aggres-
sive, however they can gnaw motionless targets to the bone. 
In  1D10  minutes  a  group  can  do  1  hit  point  damage  to  a 
defenseless target.

Eihort’s Bargain: Cornering a human victim, Eihort ques-
tions the captive and if the captive refuses Eihort, it smashes 
him or her to death.

Whoever  answers  and  accepts  Eihort’s  Bargain  accepts 
the implantation of immature Brood into his or her body. 
Progressively  horrible  and  sanity-wracking  dreams  begin, 
costing 1D4 Sanity points and adding 1D3 Cthulhu Mythos, 
affecting  the  victim  in  the  coming  months.  The  maturing 

Eihort

Brood fight the Bargainer for control of his or her body. Af-
ter 1D100 months, the struggle climaxes as terrifying visions 
wrack  the  Bargainer’s  brain,  and  at  last  the  mature  Brood 
split open the Bargainer’s body and emerge from within and 
scuttle off. The Bargainer always dies.

Ghatanothoa

Nothing I could say could even adumbrate the loathsome, 
unholy, non-human, extra-galactic horror and hatefulness 
and unutterable evil of that forbidden spawn of  
black chaos and illimitable night.

— H.P. Lovecraft and Hazel Heald, Out of the Eons

Ghatanothoa  is  known  to  be  exceedingly  horrible,  with 
myriad  tentacles,  maws,  and  sensory  organs,  with  a  defi-
nite  dreadful  outline.  In  ancient  Mu,  Ghatanothoa  dwelt 
in  a  burrow  beneath  a  city  originally  built  by  Fungi  from 
Yuggoth, though generally inhabited by primeval humans. 
The burrow was surmounted by a truncated volcanic cone. 
When Mu sank, the god’s home was overlaid by the waves 
and  he  was  no  longer  free.  Sometimes  tectonic  upheavals 
force  Ghatanothoa’s  dwelling  place  to  the  surface,  as  if  in 
horrific  preparation  for  that  awful  day  when  it  will  rise, 
along  with  R’lyeh,  to  sink  no  more.  Investigators  might 
beware  any  island  between  New  Zealand  and  Chile  that 
matches the description of Ghatanothoa’s abode.

Cult

Ghatanothoa  is  sometimes  tied  to  lloigor.  At  present,  no 
human  cultists  are  known  for  him.  In  ancient  times,  the 
priests of Mu unwillingly offered periodic human sacrifices 
to  Ghatanothoa,  lest  he  rise  from  his  extinct  volcano  and 

318 

Call of CthulhuGhatanothoa

work  greater  carnage.  Certain  fungi  from  Yuggoth  also 
served Ghatanothoa in these ancient times.

Curse  of  Ghatanothoa:  Anyone  in  visual  proximity  to  a  perfect

image  of  Ghatanothoa  is  present,  the  human  witnesses  must 
attempt CON rolls. Upon failure, the investigator loses 3D10 
DEX  as  muscles  stiffen  and  creeping  paralysis  begins.  If  an 
investigator’s DEX is brought to zero, complete immobilization 
occurs, a petrifaction process normally irreversible.

In a few minutes, the victim’s flesh and sinews rapidly harden to 
the consistency of leather and bone. The brain and other inter-
nal organs remain fresh and alive in this hard, immobile case, 
aware yet unbearably imprisoned. Only the destruction of the 
brain can end the victim’s suffering. The blind, numb victim 
loses  1D6  Sanity  points  per  day  until  reaching  permanent 
madness or the forgiving release of death.

Note:  When  he  is  at  less  than  0  hit  points,  the  Great  Old  One’s 
curse is inoperative. Once regenerating to at least +1 hit point, 
petrifaction proceeds normally.

Gla'aki
From an oval body protruded countless thin, pointed spines 
of multi-coloured metal; at the more rounded end of the 
oval a circular, thick-lipped mouth formed the centre of a 
spongy face, from which rose three yellow eyes on thin stalks. 
Around the underside of the body were many white pyramids, 
presumably used for locomotion. The diameter of the body 
must have been ten feet at its least wide…long stalks were 

twisting above it…the shape towered, pulsing and shaking 
with deafening vibration…a spine stiffened toward a victim. 
—Ramsey Campbell, The Inhabitant of the Lake

Gla'aki currently dwells at the bottom of a lake in the Severn 
River  Valley  in  England,  from  whence  it  summons  new 
cultists by a “dream-pull”—the sending of hypnotic dreams 
to potential initiates. Gla'aki is weak now, and without the 
strength drawn from the initiation process, it cannot send 
the dream-pull any distance. When someone comes to live 
nearby it can send the dreams, or it can dispatch servants of 
Gla'aki to capture or guide new initiates.

Cult
Gla'aki  heads  a  particularly  loathsome  cult  in  which  most 
members  are  undead.  On  occasion  living  humans  have 
worshiped  Gla'aki;  however,  currently  the  area  around  his 
lake is deserted.

Other Characteristics
Dream-Pull:  Gla'aki  mainly  uses  the  dream-pull  to  draw 
victims to the lake for initiation. The target’s chance to be 
overwhelmed by the dream is equal to Gla'aki’s magic points 
minus the victim’s magic points on 1D100. For each half-
mile of distance between the victim and Gla'aki’s lair, add 1 
magic point to the victim’s total for the effect of this calcula-
tion. Gla'aki can try once per night, for as many nights as 
desired.

For initiation, the novice stands on the lake shore while 
Gla'aki rises from the deep. Gla'aki drives one of its spines 
into the victim’s chest and then, on the next round, injects 
a fluid into the victim. Normally the spine kills the human 
victim.  The  spine  detaches  from  Gla'aki  and  from  it  grow 
protrusions  through  the  victim’s  body.  When  growth  is 
complete,  in  a  night  or  two,  the  spine  drops  off,  leaving  a 
livid spot that does not bleed and from which emanates a 
network of red lines. The victim is then an undead slave, a 
servant of Gla'aki.
Conditions:  if  the  damage  from  the  spine  fails  to  kill  the 
target  before  the  fluid  is  injected,  the  victim  becomes  an 
undead  horror,  but  is  not  subject  to  the  will  of  Gla'aki.  If 
possible Gla'aki has its servants capture such an individual 
and hold him or her while it drives in another spine to force 
proper  servitude.  If  the  victim  manages  to  break  off  the 
spine during the round in which he or she is stabbed and 
before the fluid is injected, he or she dies anyway but does 
not become an undead slave of Gla'aki. In the rare instance 
that the spine does not cause enough damage to kill the vic-
tim, and is broken off before the fluid is injected, the victim 
can remain a normal human being. Gla'aki’s undead slaves 
may hold novices tightly to prevent them from breaking off 
spines prematurely.

Hastur the Unspeakable
Utterly alien landscape…Foreground a deep lake. Hali? In five 
minutes the water began to ripple where something rose. Facing 
inward. A titanic aquatic being, tentacled. Octopoid, but far, 
far larger—ten—twenty times larger than the giant Octopus 
apallyon of the west coast. What was its neck alone easily fifteen 
rods in diameter. Could not risk chance of seeing its face.

—August Derleth, The Gable Window

Hastur

Hastur  the  Unspeakable  dwells  near  the  star Aldebaran  in 
the  constellation  Taurus.  He  is  connected  with  the  mystic 
Lake  of  Hali,  the Yellow  Sign,  and  Carcosa,  as  well  as  the 
things that dwell therein. He may be connected in some way 
with the power of flight through space. 

His  appearance  is  disputed.  In  a  reported  instance  of 
possession by Hastur, a corpse took on a bloated scaly look, 
and the limbs became boneless and fluid. The things in the 
Lake of Hali look octopoid from a rear view and are related 
to  Hastur.  They  also  have  unbearably  horrible  faces.  Still, 
Hastur’s appearance is largely up to the individual Keeper. 

Hastur  is  served  well  by  the  byakhee,  an  interstellar 

flying race.

Cult
The  cult  of  Hastur  is  moderately  common  on  Earth,  and 
the abominable tcho-tcho peoples are reputedly among his 
worshipers, as are the Brothers of the Yellow Sign. Hastur’s 
cult  is  particularly  loathsome,  and  is  more  widely  known 
of than it is belonged to. Worshipers refer to Hastur as "He 
Who Is Not to Be Named." This may be a misapprehension, 
stemming from his title, The Unspeakable.

Other Characteristics
Hastur is summonable only at night. When Hastur is pres-
ent, each round three individuals within 20 yards of the hor-
ror  must  successfully  Dodge  or  be  grasped  by  Hastur  and 
destroyed on the following round. Hastur does not normally 
attack friends or worshipers. He must always leave that por-
tion of the Earth where Aldebaran is below the horizon.

Call of CthulhuIthaqua

Ithaqua  is  reported  from  the  Arctic  and 
sub-Arctic,  where  Native  Americans 
encountered  him.  He  is  known  to  stalk 
the  wastes, 
tracking  down  hapless 
travelers  and  carrying  them  off.  Such 
unfortunates  are  sometimes 
found 
alive, and they linger living for a while, 
unable to explain what has happened 
to them. Most are found dead weeks 
or months later, buried partway as if 
dropped from a height, frozen solid 
in  positions  of  great  agony,  and 
missing random body parts.

Cult
Ithaqua has a minimal cult, though 
many fear him in the far north. The 
inhabitants  of  Siberia  and  Alaska 
may leave sacrifices to keep the Wen-
digo  from  haunting  their  camps, 
but  organized  worship  seems  to 
be rare. Ithaqua is more widely 
worshiped  on  the  faraway 

world of Borea.

King in Yellow, Avatar of Hastur

He stands in state upon the balcony. He has no face, and 
is twice as tall as a man, He wears pointed shoes under his 
tattered, fantastically coloured robes, and a streamer of silk 
appears to fall from the pointed tip of his hood… At times he 
appears to be winged; at other, haloed.

—James Blish, More Light

The King in Yellow might be human-seeming, clad in tat-
tered  yellow  or  particolored  rags,  and  wearing  the  Pallid 
Mask. The rags are extensions of the entity’s flesh, while the 
mask covers horrible pseudopods that can attach to a target 
and drain the very life from them (POW). Above all, the be-
ing possesses a loathsome plasticity of shape, able to stretch 
and change at will. This is the most frequently encountered 
avatar of Hastur the Unnameable.

Cult
Worshippers are often solitary madmen—artists and poets, 
driven mad by reading the haunting play The King In Yel-

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsThe King in Yellow

The Yellow Sign
Purported to be the great seal of He Who Is Not To Be 
Named  in  his  form  as  the  King  in  Yellow,  the  Yellow 
Sign holds great interest and power to those learned in 
the ways of the occult. No one single pattern can be 
agreed upon as to the Sign’s actual shape and design, 
with  many  claiming  the  Sign  somehow  changes  in 
aspect  whenever  its  master  or  His  servants  are  near. 
For years the innocent and ignorant may pass the sign 
daily without regard or knowledge of its significance; 
perhaps  only  in  nightmares  does  the  Sign  register. 
However,  once  the  Sign  becomes  "active"  the  same 
person will see it where first they did not, and many 
times thereafter in places unsuspected. Any who has 
seen the Yellow Sign is considered blessed and chosen.
Perhaps  working  subliminally,  the  Yellow  Sign  is 
a focus for evil and madness, and essentially a token 
of high worship for Hastur’s cults. Viewing the Yellow 
Sign causes 0/1D6 Sanity point loss. 

The  Sign  seems  to  swirl,  shimmer,  and  squirm, 
as if reaching for the onlooker. This effect takes but a 
moment; however, to the person affected it feels as if 
time has stood still. Those who lose Sanity points from 
seeing the Yellow Sign are cursed; the next time they 
sleep they should make another Sanity roll and if failed, 
they suffer terrible nightmares concerning the King in 
Yellow,  Carcosa,  and  Hastur  costing  a  further  point 
of Sanity. Each time thereafter the person sleeps they 
should  make  a  Sanity  roll  (0/1)  and  this  is  repeated 
each night until either they succeed in the Sanity roll or 
madness overtakes them.

Sanity Loss: With the Pallid Mask upon its face there is no Sanity 
loss; however in any other form, or with the mask removed, it 
costs 1D3/1D10 Sanity points to see the King in Yellow.

Nodens
And upon dolphins’ backs was balanced a vast crenelate shell 
wherein rode the grey and awful form of primal Nodens, 
Lord of the Great Abyss…Then hoary Nodens reached forth a 
wizened hand and helped Olney and his  
host into the vast shell. 

— H.P. Lovecraft, The Strange High House in the Mist

He usually takes the form of a normal human, grey-bearded 
and hoary. Nodens often rides in a chariot formed from a 
huge  seashell  drawn  by  unearthly  monsters  or  fantastic 
beings from earthly legend.

Cult
At times, Nodens is almost friendly to humankind. He has 
visited Earth on occasion, and is known to have aided some 
who  were  pursued  or  harassed  by  the  Great  Old  Ones  or 
Nyarlathotep. Nodens has no cult on Earth. He is served by 
nightgaunts.

a success, the foe remains and Nodens voluntarily departs to 
avoid a struggle. If Nodens is forced to leave because of some 
such being’s resisting his dismissal, he has been known to take 
a favored human with him partway, left in some random loca-
tion. He is recorded as having taken a human on trips to the 
outer reaches of the galaxy (and back again).

Nyarlathotep
A tall, slim figure with the young face of an antique pharaoh, 
gay with prismatic robes and crowned with a pshent that 
glowed with inherent light…the fascination of a dark god 
or fallen archangel, and around whose eyes there lurked the 
languid sparkle of capricious humor.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath

Nyarlathotep is the messenger, heart, and soul 
of the Gods. He is the only one to have a 
true personality, and he claims to have 
a  thousand  different  forms.  To  him, 
causing  madness  and  insanity  is 
more  important  and  enjoyable 
than mere death or destruction.

Only a few of Nyarlathotep’s 
999  forms  have  been  described. 
The  Black  Pharaoh 
is  an 
Egyptian-looking  human.  The 
Bloody  Tongue  is  an  enormous 
monster  with  clawed  append-
ages  and  a  single  long  blood-red 
tentacle  in  place  of  a  face.  This 
tentacle  stretches  forward  when  the 
Thing howls at the moon. The Haunter 
of  the  Dark  is  black  and  winged,  with  a 
tri-lobed red eye, and cannot withstand light. 
The  Bloated Woman  is  a  mammoth  woman  whose 
body  convulses  with  numerous  tentacles.  The  Beast  takes 
the form of Egypt’s Sphinx, with its face is filled with stars. 
There is some suggestion that the Black Man of European 
witch ceremonies is also a form of Nyarlathotep.

Cult
Nyarlathotep  is  typically  worshiped  though  one  of  his 
forms,  or  "masks".  There  are  numerous  such  cults,  spread 
across the entire globe. 

The  Brotherhood  of  the  Black  Pharaoh  is  centered  in 
Cairo  and  has  a  powerful  branch  in  London.  The  Cult  of 
the Bloody Tongue is known in Kenya and New York. The 
Starry  Wisdom  Cult  of  Providence  worships  the  Haunter 
of the Dark, as does the Cult of the Sand Bat in Australia. 
Other known cults include Shanghai’s Order of the Bloated 
Woman and the global Brotherhood of the Beast.

In  addition,  those  worshiping  the  gods  often  do  so  in 
hope  of  gathering  Nyarlathotep’s  favor.  Rewards  to  loyal 
slaves usually come through the Crawling Chaos, as many 

of  the  other  Gods  are  too  mindless  to  care.  Nyarlathotep 
may  grant  worshipers  knowledge  of  a  spell,  impart  some 
destructive fact or divisive religious belief or grant a servitor 
monster  as  an  assistant.  Nyarlathotep’s  gifts  always  seem 
to  provoke  turmoil  among  humanity  and  are  particularly 
likely to bring suffering and terror to a gift’s recipient.

Nyarlathotep  has  special  servants,  including  the  shan-
taks and hunting horrors. He may gift any type of creature 
to a worshiper if he deems it good. Such a bequest involves 
at least the permanent donation of POW or other character-
istic to Nyarlathotep and other gods.

Other Characteristics
Nyarlathotep enacts the will of the Azathoth and other gods 
and is accurately referred to as their soul. He always attempts 
to  bring  madness  to  humanity  and  several  prophecies,  in-
cluding the stories The Crawling Chaos, Nyarlathotep, and the 
poem  The  Fungi  from Yuggoth,  seem  to  state  that  someday 
Nyarlathotep himself will destroy humanity and possibly the 
entire  planet.  Nyarlathotep  is  always  a  mocking  figure, 
evidently contemptuous of his masters.

All  invocations  to  Azathoth  and  many 
other gods include Nyarlathotep’s name, 
possibly  recognizing  him  as  their 
messenger. He is known and feared 
by all Mythos species, and he occa-
sionally requires things of them.

In human form Nyarlathotep 
may  try  to  corrupt  or  trick  his 
foes  by  appearing  as  a  friend, 
and  is  generally  reluctant  to 
reveal  his  supernatural  powers 
unless  pressed.  Nyarlathotep 
usually  reacts  to  challenges  by 
summoning beings to carry off or 

otherwise dispose of foes.

Nyarlathotep  can 

summon  a 
member  of  any  race  in  this  book  (plus 
more  that  are  not),  at  the  cost  of  1  magic 
point  per  5  POW  points  the  creature  possesses. 
When in monstrous form, he tends to grasp his victims and 
then carry them off with him.

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsATTACKS 
Attacks per round: 1
When in human form, Nyarlathotep can be slain by normal physi-
cal means. If so slain, after collapsing the body begins to quake 
and swell, bursting to release a huge clawed monster (or some 
other monstrous form described previously). This unwelcome 
colossus  then  rises  from  the  split  corpse  and  disappears  into 
the sky without further molesting the killer. 

When in monstrous form, Nyarlathotep is difficult to slay, however 

slaying does dispel him.

Nyarlathotep’s  clawed  demon  form  changes  continually;  each 
round he will have at least two claws capable of attacking.
Fighting  attacks:  As  a  human,  has  the  usual  range  of  unarmed 
attacks  open  to  humanoids. As  a  monster  he  is  able  to  use  a 
multitude of appendages, depending on his form. 

Fighting (as a human) 100% (50/20), 1D3 or damage as per weapon 
Fighting (as a monster) 85% (42/17), 10D6 + damage bonus 
Armor:  None,  but  brought  to  0  hit  points,  he  collapses  on  the 
ground, changes form (always to a more monstrous one, which 
causes  his  viewers  to  lose  Sanity  points)  and  then  flies  into 
interstellar space.

Spells:  Nyarlathotep  knows  all  Mythos  spells;  he  can  summon 
monsters at the rate of 1 magic point per 5 POW points the 
monster  has;  he  may  summon  a  shantak,  hunting  horror,  or 
servitor of the Outer Gods, at the cost of a single magic point.
Sanity Loss: No loss to see his human form; in many of his other 

999 forms, 1D10/1D100 to see Nyarlathotep.

Nyogtha
An insidious odor began to penetrate the room. It was vaguely 
reptilian, musky, and nauseating. The disk lifted inexorably, 
and a little finger of blackness crept out from beneath its edge 
came a great wave of iridescent blackness, neither liquid nor 
solid, a frightful gelatinous mass.

—Henry Kuttner, The Salem Horror

Nyogtha is a minor deity reported to inhabit underground 
caverns  on  Earth.  It  may  be  related  to  Cthulhu.  Nyogtha 
resembles a blob of living darkness that may throw out black 
tentacles or pseudopods at will.

Cult
Nyogtha has a few worshipers, mostly witches and their ilk. 
It  teaches  them  spells  on  occasion  in  return  for  sacrifices 
and  POW.  In  the  Dreamlands,  Nyogtha  is  worshiped  by  a 
band of ghouls.

Some  ghouls  in  the  Waking  World  may  practice  this 

worship as well.

Rhan-Tegoth
An almost globular torso, with six long, sinuous limbs terminat-
ing in crab-like claws. From the upper end a subsidiary globe 
bulged forward bubble-like; its triangle of three staring, fishy eyes, 
its foot-long and evidently flexible proboscis, and a distended 
lateral system analogous to gills suggested that it was a head.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Horror in the Museum

This  minor  god  ruled  what  is  Alaska  today,  feeding  on 
stringy  hominids  who  ran  squealing  before  his  might. 
Perhaps as late as the last glacial cycle, Rhan-Tegoth entered 
into a deep hibernation from which he would not or could 
not wake. Rediscovered by modern men, most mistake the 
unmoving god for a ghastly statue.

Cult
In ancient times Rhan-Tegoth was worshiped by a primitive 
human people, perhaps of the Inuit. Since he has gone into 
hibernation, his cult has faded. The bestial gnoph-keh of the 
northern  wastes  may  also  have  some  relation  with  Rhan-
Tegoth.

Other Characteristics
A fetid amphibian-like being, he requires blood sacrifices of 
at least SIZ 75 daily. To feed, he grasps a screaming victim 
and draws him or her into the mass of tentacles. There the 
tentacles begin to drain the prey of blood, organic fluids, and 
5 STR points per round. For every 10 such points, increase

represent the aid she grants worshipers.

Summoned,  Shub-Niggurath  attacks  non-worshipers 

present.

She is often summoned specifically to accept sacrifices. 
Shub-Niggurath can be dismissed by those who know her

Seize  (mnvr):  Shub-Niggurath  has  dozens  of  tentacles,  but  can 
only seize one victim in a round. With a successful catch, the 
investigator is seized and whipped to the goddess’ body to be 
drained  of  body  fluids  by  one  of  her  many  mouths,  the  bite 
permanently draining 3D10 STR from the victim per round.
While being drained, the victim is held absolutely helplessly, and 
may not cast spells, expend magic points, or perform any act 
whatsoever except to writhe in pain and scream.

In  battle  against  more  powerful  beings,  Shub-Niggurath  still 
attacks  with  one  tentacle  per  opponent,  but  after  a  tentacle 
strikes  it  holds  on,  and  a  second  tentacle  attacks,  and  so  on. 
Each  additional  successful  attack  permits  a  new  mouth  to 
begin to drain her gigantic victim.

Trample: Once per round, Shub-Niggurath may trample beings of 
SIZ 300 or less. The trample attack is effective against all such 
beings in her path, which averages 10-20 yards across.

the corpse remains. Seeing such a corpse costs 1/1D6 Sanity

Shub-Niggurath

“Iä! Iä! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods  
with a Thousand Young!”

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Whisperer in Darkness

Shub-Niggurath is often referred to in rituals and spells. It 
has been guessed that she is a perverse fertility deity.

In one of her few descriptions, Shub-Niggurath is said 
to be an enormous cloudy mass. This mass doubtless boils 
and  festers.  It  is  likely  that  parts  of  the  mist  coalesce  at 
times, forming horrendous body parts, ropy black tentacles, 
slime-dripping  mouths,  or  short  writhing  legs,  ending  in 
black hooves which may account for the titular reference to 
“goat”. When she arrives, she may bud-off dark young.

Recent  information  suggests  that  her  milk  may  have 

remarkable properties, but Keepers must establish this.

The roots of Pagan and more modern religious rites are 
held by some to be pale reflections of earlier devotions 
to The Black Goat with a Thousand Young. The yearly 
cycle of death and rebirth, the harvest time sacrifices, 
the purging fire at Beltane, all hold traces of her wor-
ship. Whether the majority who follow the old prac-
tices of Eostre, Lammas, or Samhain are aware of the 
true origins is doubtful; however, there are certain wise 
folk still dwelling at the edges of society who certainly 
do  understand  the  meaning  of  the  rites.  One  should 
be wary of approaching such cunning folk as one can 
never be sure whose servant they truly are.

Shudde M’ell
A great gray thing a mile long chanting and exuding strange 
acids…charging through the depths of the earth at a fantastic 
speed, in a dreadful fury…melting basaltic rocks  
like butter under a blowtorch.

—Brian Lumley, The Burrowers Beneath

He is preeminent among the chthonians and apparently is 
the largest and most evil of his kind. According to legends he 
once was imprisoned beneath G’harne, however is now free 
to wander the Earth with his kin.

Cult
Chthonians, Shudde M’ell among them, are not much wor-
shiped by humans nowadays, though druids are rumored to 
have done so in the past and remnant Stone Age tribes may 
continue the practice. Perhaps the races that built G’harne 
did so to honor Shudde M’ell.

Other Characteristics
By  himself,  Shudde  M’ell  can  cause  a  local  earthquake  of 
shocking  intensity.  In  conjunction  with  other  chthonians, 
he  can  create  strong  earthquakes  of  regional  size,  strong 
enough to topple buildings or destroy bridges.

If  Shudde  M’ell  attacks  directly,  a  vast  hole  opens  up, 
accompanied  by  a  terrible  chanting  noise  and  slobbering, 
sucking sounds. Everything over the hole, which is at least 
1D10+10 yards across, is sucked in and destroyed. Chtho-
nians then pour out of the hole and attack survivors.

Tsathoggua

He discerned in a dark recess the formless bulking of a 
couchant mass. And the mass stirred a little at his approach, 
and put forth with infinite slothfulness a huge and toad-
shaped head. And the head opened its eyes very slowly, as if 
half awakened from slumber, so that they were visible as two 
slits of oozing phosphor in the black browless face.

—Clark Ashton Smith, The Seven Geases

He dwells in the black gulf of N’Kai, where he first arrived on 
Earth from Saturn. He is one of the less malevolent beings 
of the Cthulhu Mythos, though still terrible. Tsathoggua is

Tulzscha
A belching column of sick greenish flame…spouting volcani-

stone with a nasty, venomous verdigris. For in all that 
seething combustion no warmth lay, but only the clamminess 
of death and corruption.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Festival.

At the court of Azathoth, it is a blazing green ball of flame, 
dancing  with  brethren  gods  before  the  Daemon  Sultan. 
Called to our world, it assumes a gaseous form, penetrates 
the planet to the core and then erupts from below as a pillar 
of flame. It cannot move from where it emerges.

Cult
A few pockets of cultists worship this obscure entity, gener-
ally in subterranean temples, and especially during equinox-
es,  solstices,  and  important  conjunctions.  Tulzscha  thrives 
on death, corruption, and decay.

Tsathoggua was worshiped by serpent people and the furry 
subhuman voormis in ancient times, and by sorcerers and 
wizards in later times. He has given magic gates and spells 
to the faithful in the past. He is served by a race of entities

will be in great agony, with acid burns, vitriol running through

Ubbo-Sathla
There, in the gray beginning of Earth, the formless mass that 
was Ubbo-Sathla reposed amid the slime and the vapors. 
Headless, without organs or members, it sloughed off from 
its oozy sides, in a slow, ceaseless wave, the amoebic forms 
that were the archetypes of earthly life. About it there lay the 
mighty tablets of star-quarried stone that were writ with the 
inconceivable wisdom of the premundane gods.

—Clark Ashton Smith, Ubbo-Sathla

This god dwells in a cold, dank cavern, and never leaves its 
lair  unless  called  or  disturbed.  The  grotto  can  be  entered 
through deep fissures in the Antarctic ice or through secret 
entrances  from  the  Cold Waste  of  the  Dreamlands.  Other 
routes may exist.

Cult
Ubbo-Sathla  has  no  human  cult,  although  the  mi-go  and 
other alien races may worship it. The Book of Eibon and the 
Necronomicon mention this god.

Other Characteristics
The Unbegotten Source may have spawned the prototypes 
of all earthly life. It is hinted that it was from Ubbo-Sathla’s 
tissues that the elder things created their dread shoggoths. 
Within  the  grotto  of  Ubbo-Sathla,  several  tablets  of  star-
wrought  stone  rest,  said  to  contain  great  knowledge  and 
secrets  of  the  gods.  These  tablets,  the  Elder  Keys,  remain 
an  enigma.  Seeking  these  tablets,  even  the  most  powerful 
sorcerers have failed to return.

An observer sees hundreds of pseudopods forming, flail-
ing about, grasping prey and being absorbed back into the 
body mass at all times. Remaining more than a few minutes 
in the god’s presence insures that one or more investigators 
will be attacked. 
Spawn  of  Ubbo-Sathla:  It  continually  produces  1D10 
offspring per round, some of which it eats and others that 
escape.  Those  surviving  fulfill  every  whim  and  urge  of 
their  primal,  mindless  sire.  Generally  encountered  only  in 
Ubbo-Sathla’s primal grotto, no two spawn are exactly 
alike. All prefer surprise attacks from ambush: 
some  attack  with  sticky  filaments,  some  with 
pseudopods,  some  with  gelatinous  tentacles, 
and so on.

Y’golonac

He saw why the shadow on the frosted pane yesterday had 
been headless, and he screamed. As the desk was thrust aside 
by the towering naked figure, on whose surface still hung rags 
of the tweed suit, Strutt’s last thought was an unbelieving 
conviction that this was happening because he had read the 
Revelations…but before he could scream out his protest his 
breath was cut off, as the hands descended on his face and the 
wet red mouths opened in their palms.

—Ramsey Campbell, Cold Print

Y’golonac  is  delineated  in  the  Revelations  of  Gla'aki,  an 
arcane  book.  It  is  a  bloated,  glowing  figure  who  dwells 
underground  in  a  vast  ruin  behind  a  wall  of  bricks.  This 
prison may be near the Severn Valley city of Brichester, for it 
is known to frequent that place. Y’golonac is known to come 
when its name is read or spoken while evil is present. It is a 
minor god, but malignant.

Cult
Y’golonac has little cult following, but strives mightily after 
more  worship,  entrapping  those  who  are  subtly  evil  to  be 
his priests. Y’Golonac’s notion of evil seems to be a shallow 
one, however.

Other Characteristics
Y’golonac may appear to be a normal, somewhat neurotic 
and flabby human. When he manages to contact a person 
that is debased in evil, the victim is possessed and absorbed 
by the deity and thereafter his shape can change at will from 
the  form  of  the  possessed  individual  to  Y’golonac’s  true 

Y'golonac

To fight off a possession, the target must roll POW or less 
on 1D100 each round to avoid being overcome. Once over-
come, the investigator loses 10 INT and 10 POW each round 
until Y’golonac is forced away or until his soul and mind are 
destroyed  and  replaced  with  Y’golonac’s—and  Y’golonac 
departs only if he loses all his hit points. Y’golonac normally 
attacks  people  who  have  become  aware  of  him,  usually 
through reading at least a page of the Revelations of Gla'aki. 
Y’golonac is clever at getting persons to read passages from 
that horrid book without knowing they have done so.

Yibb-Tstll

There, about the pulsating black body of the Ancient One, 
hugely winged reptilian creatures without faces cluttered 
and clutched at a multitude of blackly writhing, pendulous 
breasts! The eyes moved quickly, independently—sliding with 
vile viscosity over the whole rotten surface of  
Yibb-Tstll’s pulpy, glistening head!

—Brian Lumley, The Horror at Oakdeene

This horrible deity sees all time and space as it slowly rotates 
in the center of its clearing in the Jungle of Kled, in Earth’s 
Dreamlands. Beneath its billowing cloak are a multitude of 
nightgaunts, suckling and clutching at Yibb-Tstll’s breasts.

Cult
In ancient times Yibb-Tstll was worshiped as the god Yibb, 
however now he has no known cult. 

Yibb-Tstll  is  often  approached  by  individuals—most 
often  sorcerers—who  either  crave  the  use  of  Yibb-Tstll’s 
servitors, the nightgaunts, or ask for his beneficent touch.

Yig

The half-human father of serpents…the snake-god of the 
central plains tribes—presumably the primal source of the 
more southerly Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan—was an odd, 
half-anthropomorphic devil.

—H.P. Lovecraft and Zealia Bishop, The Curse of Yig

Yig is never clearly described, but may look like a scaly strong 
man with a serpent-like head or a normal head. He may be 
accompanied by mobs of snakes. He seems to be mainly a 
North American deity. The notorious “Curse of Yig” consists 
of madness and malformed children.

Cult
Yig is recorded as being worshiped by Plains tribes and voo-
doo doctors, and may be somehow connected to Quetzalcoatl. 
He is also worshiped by the serpent people and their kin. 
Worshipers  gain  some  immunity  from  poisonous  snakes, 
the  ability  to  talk  to  snakes,  and  some  arcane  rituals  and 
spells. If someone exposes cult secrets or does harm to the 
cult, Yig sends a sacred snake to kill the offender.

Other Characteristics
A manifestation of Yig would be signaled largely or entirely 
by  a  carpet  of  serpents—rattlers  in  North  America,  puff 
adders or cobras elsewhere.

A  sacred  snake  of Yig  is  always  a  large  individual  of  a 
species  native  to  the  area  where  manifested,  with  a  white 
crescent on the top of its head. In North America, usually 
such  a  snake  would  be  an  enormous  tom  rattler,  at  least 
5-6 feet long. The snake appears so swiftly that the victim 
is  always  startled  and  automatically  hit  unless  he  or  she 
can react swiftly (roll Dodge skill). On subsequent rounds, 
successful Dodge use is required to avoid being bitten by the 
snake,  which  will  pursue  and  continue  to  attack  unless  it 
is killed. No antivenin can save someone bitten by a sacred 
snake of Yig—bitten, he or she always dies after a few min-
utes of agony.

Call of CthulhuYog-Sothoth
Great globes of light massing towards the opening…the 
breaking apart of the nearest globes, and the protoplasmic 
flesh that flowed blackly outward to join together and 
form that eldritch, hideous horror from outer space…
whose mask was a congeries of iridescent globes…who 
froths as primal slime in nuclear chaos forever beyond 
the nethermost outposts of space and time!
—August Derleth, The Lurker at the Threshold

Yog-Sothoth dwells in the interstices between 
the planes that compose the universe. There 
it  manifests  as  a  conglomeration  of  iri-
descent globes, which are always shifting, 
flowing  into  one  another,  and  breaking. 
This  conglomeration  is  large,  but  vari-
able, so that at one time it may appear 
to  be  100  yards  across  and  at  another 
time  half  a  mile  or  more.  Connections 
between  Yog-Sothoth’s  appearance  and 
sightings of so-called flying saucers are obvious.

Cult

Yog-Sothoth  is  preeminently  the  deity  of  sorcerers 
and  wizards.  He  grants  them  the  power  to  travel 
between  the  planes,  or  the  power  to  see  into  other  planes 
via a piece of magic glass or the like. Yog-Sothoth may also 
give its slaves the ability to command various monsters from 
distant worlds.

In  return  for  these  gifts,  worshipers  open  the  way  for 
Yog-Sothoth to travel from his usual domains to Earth, to 
ravage and plunder.

As  Tawil  at’Umr,  all  those  wishing  to  travel  to  distant 
times and places may safely deal with him. This form seems 
to be the least malignant way in which to meet him but even 
then there is always a danger that Tawil at’Umr will remove 
its  veil  and  cause  utter  madness  and  destruction  to  those 
dealing with it.

Other Characteristics

Yog-Sothoth holds the power to travel within the planes to 
reach any other time or space. Yog-Sothoth itself is cotermi-
nous with all time and space. Because of this, Yog-Sothoth 
has  been  called  the  Key  and  the  Gate.  In  Yog-Sothoth’s 
aspect as Opener of the Way it is recorded as Umr at’Taw-
il,  the  correct  Arabic  form  would  be  Tawil  at’Umr,  which 
means  the  Prolonged  of  Life. Yog-Sothoth  wishes  to  enter 
this plane to feast on the life it contains, but only can do so 
at certain times.

Yog-Sothoth can fly through our atmosphere at speeds 

of hundreds or thousands of miles per hour.

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsZoth-Ommog

Zoth-Ommog

A body shaped like a broad-based, truncated cone. A flat, 
blunt, wedge-shaped, vaguely reptilian head surmounts this 
conical torso, and the head is almost entirely hidden behind 
swirling tresses. This hair, or beard and mane, consists of 
thickly carved and coiling ropes, like serpents or worms …
Through this repulsive Medusa-mane of ropy tendrils, two 
fierce, serpent-like eyes glare in a horrible intermingling of 
cold, inhuman mockery and what I can only  
describe as gloating menace.

—Lin Carter, Zoth-Ommog

It has a cone-shaped body with a lizard-like head. From the 
head grows a mass of thick serpent-like tentacles. From the 
base of the neck project four thick pseudopods resembling 
starfish arms, one on each side of the body. Zoth-Ommog 
is evidently buried underneath the Pacific in the corpse-city 
of R’lyeh.

Cult
Zoth-Ommog  has  no  active  cult  among  humans.  Some 
deep  ones  may  worship  this  malign  entity.  Zoth-Ommog 
can manifest itself through one of the many statues of itself 
scattered apparently randomly around the world.

Section Three:  
Traditional Horrors
One might easily imagine an alien nucleus of substance or 
energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible or 
immaterial subtractions from the life-force or bodily tissues 
and fluids of other more palpably living things into which it 
penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes  
completely merges.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Shunned House

Games  of  Call  of  Cthulhu  can  be  used  to  tell  any  kind  of 
horror  story—don’t  feel  restricted  to  using  authentically 
Lovecraftian adversaries. Traditional horror has often relied 
on the duality of good versus evil, a concept which loses its 
meaning in Lovecraft’s nihilistic universe. Many of the su-
pernatural beings of legend are traditionally defeated with 
the  use  of  religious  paraphernalia:  the  vampire  is  harmed 
by holy water and repelled by a crucifix; ghosts and demons 
are  subject  to  exorcism  by  Christian  priests.  Why  should 
such things work in a Lovecraftian setting? Not everything 
needs to be explained, but glaring inconsistencies should be 
addressed; if vampires are affected by a crucifix, then why 
aren’t ghouls? 

Trying  to  marry  the  traditional  horror  tropes  with  a 
Lovecraftian  universe  might  not  be  as  easy  as  it  sounds. 
It may be helpful to distinguish between games that use a 
Lovecraftian setting from generic horror games.

Consistency  is  only  required  where  two  stories  are 
linked. You may decide to have crucifixes burn the flesh of 
the undead in a 1970s vampire scenario only to have such 
things mocked and without value in a modern-day encoun-
ter with the Mythos. If the stories are not linked (i.e. use a 
different set of characters) then no consistency is required.
The use of traditional monsters within games also pro-
vides  Keepers  with  the  option  of  inserting  "red  herrings" 
into  the  story  or  ensuring  that  games  don’t  become  stale 
as the investigators face yet another Mythos monster, week 
after  week.  Blending  traditional  and  Mythos  monsters 
allows Keepers to create unique and challenging mysteries 
where the players may think they know what they face, only 
to  discover  some  new  hybrid  horror  that  is  all  the  more 
challenging and frightening.

Ghost
Each  ghost  should  be  crafted  by  the  Keeper  to  fit  the  cir-
cumstances  of  the  scenario.  Ghosts  generally  possess  only 
INT and POW, appearing as dim, misty forms. They haunt 

332 

Call of CthulhuGhost

certain locations or specific objects (such as a book, 
ship, or automobile).

Ghosts may or may not be vulnerable to magic 

or to exorcism. Ghosts especially seem to haunt 
locations in order to communicate the awfulness 
that  prompted  their  formation.  Sometimes  a 
ghost gives clues or instructions, which, if carried 
out, let the anxious shade dissolve and find peace. 
Though  all  ghosts  are  terrifying,  some  are  more 
loathsome  than  others;  a  1D8  Sanity  point  loss 
should be the maximum loss for seeing a ghost.

Special Powers
For a ghost’s attack, use an opposed POW roll. As this 
happens, the ghost may be glimpsed as clawing at, en-
veloping, or otherwise physically attacking the target.

If  the  character  fails  the  opposed  POW  roll,  the 
character  loses  2D10  POW.  If  the  character  can  over-
come the ghost, he or she causes the ghost to lose 2D10 
POW. Any points of POW lost are forfeit. Ghosts of greater 
strength may drain 3D10 POW or more from a victim in a 
single combat round, but such potent entities still lose only 
2D10 POW if overcome by the victim in a particular round. 
It is up to the Keeper to determine how a ghost can be 

laid to rest. Some possibilities include:

i  Locating the source of attachment for the ghost and 

destroying it.

i  Locating the physical remains of the ghost and salt-

ing and burning them.

i  Exorcising  the  ghost  (this  might  include  opposed 

POW rolls).

i  Enabling the ghost to fulfill its mission (preventing 
the death of a loved one, resolving unfinished busi-
ness, etc.)

Some  ghosts  can  manipulate  the  environment  around 
them,  causing  pots  to  fly  off  shelves,  doors  to  open  and 
telephones  to  ring—the  infamous  poltergeist.  More  pow-
erful  poltergeists  may  cause  physical  harm  to  the  unwary 
by attacking with thrown items. In such instances, 
investigators  should  use  the  Dodge  skill  to  avoid 
being hit and perhaps look for alternative means to 
calm or expel the angry spirit.

Individually crafted ghosts are good sources of 
spooky scenarios. Entire campaigns can be devoted 
to  the  study  of  and  exorcism  of  ghosts.  Books  to 
read  as  sources  for  ideas  about  ghosts  include 
The  Haunting  of  Hill  House  (both  the  novel  and 
the  1963  film,  The  Haunting)  by  Shirley  Jackson, 
The Shining by Stephen King, any of William Hope 
Hodgson’s ghost stories (particularly the Carnacki 
the Ghost Finder tales), and the ghost stories of M. 
R. James. Henry James contributes a whole volume 
of ghost stories in his Collected Works and Rudyard 
Kipling  set  some  excellent  tales  of  ghosts  in 
both England and India.

Mummy
These undead beings are similar to intelligent zom-
bies. Some cults keep mummies in their temples as 
guardians. Like zombies, mummies must be hacked 
apart to make them cease action. Contrary to popular 
belief, many mummies lack bandage wrappings and 
can  move  relatively  swiftly.  Some  mummies  cannot 
naturally regenerate magic points.

A mummy has double its human STR, 1.5 times 

its original CON and two-thirds of original DEX.

Because of the bitumen and bandages frequently 
used  to  preserve  them,  fire  is  particularly  effective 
against Egyptian mummies: damage is normal, howev-
er the flames are more difficult to extinguish because of 
the bitumen in the wrappings.

Skeleton, human
Animated skeletons are encountered in a few medieval

Special Powers

Resistant  to  harm:  Dried  bones  are  fairly  brittle, 
snapping  and  splintering  easily  from  a  heavy  blow, 
however no area of a skeleton is more vulnerable than 
any other. Any blow striking a skeleton has a chance 
of destroying it equal to or less than the damage done 
x 5 (as rolled on 1D100). For example, if an axe hit 
a  skeleton  and  did  8  points  damage,  there  would  be 
a 40% chance of destroying the skeleton by shattering 
it. Unless the skeleton shatters, it remains totally un-
damaged.

Apply  one  penalty  die  on  attacks  made 
with an impaling weapon (including bullets), 
since much of the target is simply air.

Vampire
Every player will be interested in matching wits with these 
bloodsuckers;  however  stories  about  vampires  and  their 
powers  are  so  conflicting  and  contradictory  that  the  in-
dividual  Keeper  must  determine  which  vampire  facts  are 
true in play and which are merely legendary. Here are some 
options:

i  A vampire casts no reflection. 
i  A  vampire  may  have  to  return  to  soil  in  which  it 
originally  was  buried  in  order  to  pass  the  daylight 
hours.

i  The third bite from a vampire causes a character to 

die and then to become one of the undead.
i  A vampire has no special powers in daylight and 
may be unable to move abroad, or be unable to 
move from its coffin.

Special Powers
Once  physical  attacks  have  exceeded  its  hit  points,  the 
vampire  turns  into  smoke  or  mist  at  the  end  of  the 
round  after  which  its  hit  points  reached  zero,  there-
after regenerating hit points at the rate of 1 point per 
round. If, when at zero hit points, a stake is driven 
through its heart the vampire is killed and reduced 
to ashes.

Fighting attacks: Vampires have the usual range of unarmed at-

tacks open to humanoids.

Bite:  Depending  on  the  style  of  your  vampire,  the  vampire  may 
have to hold the victim to continue draining its victim’s blood, 
or  the  act  of  biting  may  subdue  the  victim  to  the  vampire’s 
will. Either way the vampire drains 2D10 STR (blood) from the 
victim each round thereafter.

Gaze: If the target fails an opposed POW roll the target is hypno-
tized and can be made to follow simple instructions. If these 
instructions  are  self-destructive,  at  the  start  of  a  round  the 
target’s player may attempt an INT roll to snap out of it.

Sanity Loss: 0/1D4 Sanity points to be attacked; 1/1D3 to wit-
ness  a  transformation. Vampires  of  human  appearance  cost 
no Sanity points to see.

i  In  Christian  cultures,  the  cross  gives  pro-
tection  from  a  vampire,  at  least  for  a  while, 
and holy water touching the thing sears and 
scalds its flesh.

i  The vampire is only affected by the religion it 

practiced or understood while alive.

i  A vampire never drinks or eats. 
i  A vampire may not pass over running water.
i  A vampire can change into smoke, mist, 
a  wolf  or  a  bat  at  will.  If  smoke  or 
mist, it drifts at the rate of one yard 
per round.

Werewolf
Traditionally,  a  normal  human  is  cursed  and  occa-
sionally thereafter turns into a monster, half-human 
and  half-beast—classically  at  the  full  moon.  This 
unfortunate may be unaware of the curse or may de-
test his or her fate. A second sort may fully transform 
into a wolf, glorying in its transformations, and has 
more control over the metamorphoses than the first. 
Ravenous and savage attacks, much like the classical 

mad dog or rabid human, are typical of both. 

Both  types  of  werewolf  apparently  propa-
gate by transmitting a transformational agent 
through  the  saliva  while  biting.  In  some 
cultures  a  person  may  become  a  werewolf 

Vampire

334 

Call of Cthulhudue to witchcraft; the curse in this case being a spell. 
While some folklore suggests that a person can enact 
the  transformation  upon  themselves  by  ingesting 
certain plants and the blood of the innocent.

As humans, werewolves are outwardly nor-

mal and have normal human characteristics. 
The man-beast and giant wolf forms below 
share  common  attacks,  armor,  etc.  The 
Keeper  may  or  may  not  charge  a  sanity 
loss for the wolf form: if there is a Sanity 
loss, give the creature glowing eyes and 
other supernatural attributes to account 
for  the  perception  in  the  mind  of  the 
character.

Special Powers

Regeneration:  In  bestial  form  the 
werewolf  is  notoriously  resistant 
to  injury,  regenerating  1  hit  point 
every round. Scars and welts of such 
damage  may  remain  after  the  ravener  reassumes 
human form. Such healing is weakening, often forcing the 
shape-changer to spend days in bed. 

Werewolf

Immunity:  Werewolves  are  immune  to  most  weapons, 
however they can be damaged or killed by fire or by silver 
weapons. Its fur set afire, the werewolf loses hit points faster 
than it can regenerate. Silver, the lunar metal, is poisonous to 
the werewolf. If the werewolf receives a major wound (half 
its hit point total or above in one wound) from a weapon 
made of silver the werewolf will die. If it takes a less than 
major wound from a silver weapon the werewolf may not 
regenerate hit points so lost.

Zombie

335 

Zombie

The spell creating the zombie supplies the points 
of POW motivating it. Each spell-caster directs 
what he or she creates: zombies, in the main, 

have no will of their own.

As  the  Keeper  wishes,  a  few  spells  and 
substances  may  deactivate  these  things. 
According  to  voodoo  tradition,  zombies 
could be destroyed by feeding them salt; 
their  makers  would  first  sew  shut  their 
mouths to guard against this. 

In addition to the voodoo tradition, 
Keepers  should  note  the  Resurrection 
spell  within  the  Cthulhu  Mythos  tra-
dition—a  means  of  resurrecting  the 
dead (which seem mostly in control 
of  their  faculties),  and  the  new 
rationales  that  weird  science,  or  vile 

pollution might also create zombie-like things.

Section Four: Beasts
A comprehensive guide to all the varieties of animals 
in the world is clearly beyond the scope of this book 
and  would  be  quite  unnecessary  for  play.  The  an-
imals  listed  below  are  those  that  feature  as  foes  in 
stories of the horror genre (think of Hitchcock’s The 
Birds) or those that might be utilized by the investi-
gators (such as horses as mounts).

Bat, Large
The giant fruit bat of Central America congregates in doz-
ens or hundreds. The smaller bats common to the United 
States  gather  in  enormous  cavern-based  flocks  of 
up to 50,000 individuals. Bats worldwide are under 
severe environmental attack from humans.

Bird
Common birds such as the magpie, crow, and jackdaw offer 
no threat to humans normally, however in the horror genre 
these  creatures  sometimes  turn  into  foes.  Use  the  values 
given for bats for an individual smaller bird.

Larger  birds  may  pose  possible  threats  if  so  inclined. 
The statistics below provide for a giant eagle or any other 
large bird. Only the largest birds will attack humans, though 
vultures will attack helpless prey of any sort. All birds have 
the special ability to cut an attacker’s chance to hit in half 
(one penalty die to hit) while they are flying.

Larger birds live in the higher hills and mountains, which 
offer safe nesting sites and reliable updrafts for soaring. They 
perch among pinnacles or on rocky ledges, or even in trees 
that have grown close enough to support the considerable 

weight of up to a half-dozen large birds and their nest. The 
range  of  such  birds  is  effectively  the  western  hemisphere, 
but no reason exists that a Keeper cannot say, “A giant bird 
is diving at you” anywhere this side of Antarctica, where the 
giant birds only walk.

Horse
Horses offer many advantages to those who know their ways. 
For  roleplaying,  divide  them  into  riding  horses,  draught 
horses, donkeys, and mules.

Use of the riding horse is covered by the Ride skill. Single 
riders and small groups can easily cover forty miles in a day, 
given  plenty  of  water  and  fodder,  such  as  oats  and  other 
grains. Riding horses may spar with other horses, but they 
do  not  fight  unless  cornered.  Even  cavalry-trained  horses 
are  trained  merely  to  stay  their  ground  and  control  their 
nervousness. Nearly all horses will panic at the presence of 
some supernatural thing.

Draught horses are the largest of horses, usually broken 
to  ride  but  not  much  ridden.  To  hitch  them  to  wagons,  a 
Drive  Horses  or  similar  roll  might  be  asked.  Saddles  and 
girths large enough for them may not exist; bareback riding 
could be done with one penalty die to the Ride skill.

Donkeys  and  mules  mostly  carry  burdens,  not  riders, 
or draw wagons or carts. Stereotypically, they ignore com-
mands when it pleases them, even brutal ones.

Among  all  horses,  the  tendency  concerning  bloody 
events, gunfire, monsters, angry crowds and so on, will be a 
sensible one, to flee.

Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your

to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over

screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' 
and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. 

—Peter Benchley, Jaws

Dangerous  and  feared  through  all  the  world’s  oceans  by 
humanity and sea-creatures alike, these predators have been 
called the perfect killing machine. These statistics are for a

hunted for their skin.

they gain one bonus die on the attack. Such an attack would 
involve swarming over the target, biting and scratching as they 
do so.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 2 (can only grab and hold one victim)
Fighting attacks: Biting, thrashing and slashing with its fins.
Bite and Hold (mnvr): A shark may bite and hold onto its victim, 
inflicting automatic damage on following rounds until it can 
be dislodged by an opposed STR roll.

Shark

Snake
Broadly falling into two categories: constrictors and venom-
ous.  The  former  use  their  attack  to  grapple  and  constrict 
their  prey  (use  the  maneuver  rules),  the  latter  using  their 
attack to bite. 

ATTACKS 
Attacks per round: 1 (can use Bite to fight-back numerous times 

per round)

Fighting  attacks:  Bite.  The  toxicity  of  snake  venom  can  vary. 
Victims  must  make  an  Extreme  CON  roll  to  resist  full  effect 
of the poison. A successful roll indicates a lesser effect. Unless 
antivenin or suitable medical treatment can be found within a 
few hours, the victim of a bite may die (see Poisons, page 128).

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsWasp and Bee Swarms
A cloud of stinger-equipped, flying insects attacks for 2D6 
combat rounds before halting pursuit. Unless the victims are 
completely covered (as with netting or by being enclosed in 
an automobile or by diving underwater), there is no protec-
tion against them. An investigator who is stung extensively 
and whose player fails a CON roll may experience profound 
immune system shock, fall seriously ill, and (rarely) die.

The Africanized bees presently colonizing the Americas 
are  more  intent  in  their  pursuit  than  are  honey  bees  or 
wasps,  attacking  for  up  to  3D6  minutes.  Being  seriously 
stung  by  these  so-called  killer  bees  occasionally  results  in 
death, since the attacks are comparatively unrelenting and 
often  more  numerous.  Each  minute  of  such  attack  might 
cost as much as 1D6 hit points.

Wolf
They may hunt in packs when dogging herds of elk or cari-
bou; they as often hunt singly or in family pairings.

Wolves are normally shy and verified attacks on healthy 

humans are said to be rare or non-existent.

An Optional Structure for 
the Cthulhu Mythos
Lovecraft wrote many wonderful stories, but each of them 
stood  alone  rather  than  being  part  of  a  cohesive  whole. 
There were of course some common named elements within 
his  stories,  certain  places,  characters,  books,  gods,  and  so 
forth, but when one looks closely these are rarely repeated 
or developed. The stronger commonality is less tangible; a 
certain feel and atmosphere that Lovecraft sought to capture 
in  his  "weird  tales".  The  repeated  story  elements  are  more 
easily latched onto, and form the body of what has become 
known as the Cthulhu Mythos. 

Real  world  myths  have  inconsistencies  and  contradic-
tions,  and  this  is  also  true  of  the  Cthulhu  Mythos.  It  is 
these very inconsistencies and contradictions that make the 
Cthulhu  Mythos  such  fertile  ground  for  others  to  cultivate 
their own story-seeds. As Keeper, you should feel empowered 
to make your own decisions, using the various entities, dei-
ties, tomes, and so on as building blocks to create your own 
unique stories. The Cthulhu Mythos is meant to be beyond 
man’s understanding, so for this book to attempt to define it 
too closely may prove counterproductive for the reader.

Some have tried to define a pantheon of Mythos gods or 
to classify them into a hierarchy of Elder Gods, Other Gods, 
Outer  Gods,  Great  Old  Ones,  and  so  on.  These  differing 
classifications of the Mythos entities are not set in stone and 
provided  merely  as  a  guide  for  those  who  might  prefer  a 
more definite structure. 

Outer Gods, Elder Gods, Other Gods
Depending on which author one reads, the universe is ruled 
by beings variously known as the Elder Gods, Outer Gods, 
or  Other  Gods.  Only  a  few  of  these  deities  are  known  by 
name.  The  majority  are  both  blind  and  idiotic.  They  are 
all  extremely  powerful  alien  beings  and  some  may  be  of 
extra-cosmic origin.

The Outer Gods rule the universe and have little to do 
with humanity, except for Nyarlathotep. Humans meddling 
with  these  entities  suffer  for  it,  usually  ending  up  mad  or 
dead. Names for a few Outer Gods are known. They appear 
almost  to  be  true  gods,  as  opposed  to  the  alien  horror  of 
the Great Old Ones, and some may personify cosmic prin-
ciples.  Only  a  few  of  these  deities  seem  to  take  interest  in 
human affairs or to acknowledge the existence of the human 
race. When  they  do,  they  often  are  shown  trying  to  break 
through cosmic walls or dimensions in order to wreak new 
destruction.  All  the  races  and  lesser  deities  of  the  Mythos 
acknowledge the Outer Gods and many worship them.

The Outer Gods are controlled, or at least represented, 
to some extent by their messenger and soul, Nyarlathotep. 
When  the  Outer  Gods  are  discomforted,  Nyarlathotep

Call of Cthulhu341 

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsinvestigates.  Azathoth,  the  daemon  sultan  and  ruler  of 
the  cosmos,  writhes  mindlessly  to  the  piping  of  a  demon 
flute  at  the  center  of  the  universe.  Yog-Sothoth,  either  a 
second-in-command  or  co-ruler,  is  coterminous  with  all 
time and space, but locked somehow outside the mundane 
universe. Yog-Sothoth  can  be  summoned  to  this  side  only 
through the use of mighty spells, whereas Azathoth theoret-
ically might be met by traveling far enough through space. 
A  group  of  Outer  Gods  and  their  servitors  dance  slowly 
around Azathoth, but none are named.

The  Outer  Gods  include:  Abhoth,  Azathoth,  Daoloth, 
The  Lesser  Other  Gods,  Nyarlathotep,  Shub-Niggurath, 
Tulzscha, Ubbo Sathla, Yibb-Tstll, and Yog-Sothoth. 

The Elder Gods are not a Lovecraftian convention; later 
writers (such as August Derleth) coined the term and many 
consider  them  a  poorly-judged  addition  to  the 
Mythos  as  they  suggest  the  concepts  of 
good and evil—terms that have little 
or no meaning when considering 
the  actions,  purpose,  and 
ideologies  of  cosmic  alien 
gods. Derleth posited that 
the  Elder  Gods  some-
how  oppose  the  Outer 
Gods  and  the  Great 
Old  Ones,  and  are 
in  fact  the  cause  of 
the  catastrophe  that 
brought  about  the 
imprisonment of the 
Great Old Ones. 

The  Elder  Gods 
include: Bast, Hypnos, 
and Nodens.
Outer 

and  Elder 

sometimes  have 

Gods 
been  lumped  together  and 
confusingly  called  the  Other 
Gods,  though  primarily  gods 
of the outer planets and not of our 
Earth.  They  would  seem  seldom  called 
here, but when they do appear they are second 
to nothing in horror. (And, just to thoroughly confuse you, 
a  set  of  minor  Outer  Gods  are  known  collectively  as  the 
Lesser  Other  Gods!)  Species  associated  with  these  deities 
(shantaks,  hunting  horrors,  servitors  of  the  Outer  Gods, 
dark  young  of  Shub-Niggurath)  are  correspondingly  rare 
on Earth.

The Great Old Ones
They  are  not  as  supernatural  as  the  Outer  Gods,  but  are 
nonetheless god-like and terrible to human senses. Humans 
are much more likely to worship Great Old Ones, who are 
comparatively  near  at  hand  and  who  occasionally  partici-
pate  in  human  affairs  or  contact  individual  humans,  than 
they are to worship Outer Gods. Entire clans or cults may 
secretly  worship  a  Great  Old  One.  Lone  madmen,  on  the 

other hand, seem to prefer the Outer Gods. Beings serving 
the Great Old Ones frequently inhabit the remote fastness 
of the Earth. Investigators most often encounter their wor-
shipers and alien servants.

The Great Old Ones themselves appear to be immensely 
powerful  alien  beings  with  supernatural-seeming  abilities, 
but not to be true gods in the sense that the Outer Gods are 
reported. Each Great Old One is independent of the rest and 
many seem to be temporarily imprisoned in some way.

It  is  said  that “when  the  stars  are  right”  the  Great  Old 
Ones can plunge from world to world. When the stars are not 
right, they cannot live. “Cannot live” need not mean death, as 
the famous couplet from the Necronomicon suggests.

That is not dead which can eternal lie,

And with strange aeons even death may die.

Cthulhu  is  a  Great  Old  One. 
With  the  rest  of  his  race,  he

to  be  the  most  import-

on  Earth.  Others  of

as  being  both

Unspeakable  dwells  near 
Aldebaran  and  Cthugha 
near Fomalhaut. Other Great 
Old Ones doubtless infest other 
worlds and it may be common for 
a world to be ruled by dominant Great 
Old Ones. All those known on Earth are in-
voked or worshiped by humans but, by the evidence 
of the stories, Cthulhu is worshiped more than the rest put 
together.  Minor  Great  Old  Ones,  such  as  Quachil  Uttaus, 
usually have no worshipers, however wizards may  summon 
them. 

Interventions  by  Great  Old  Ones  in  human  affairs  are 
isolated.  Some  commentators  suspect  that  these  greater 
beings rarely think about human beings or take them into 
account. Humanity is negligible and unimportant.

The  Great  Old  Ones  include: Atlach-Nacha,  Chaugnar 
Faugn,  Cthugha,  Cthulhu,  Cyaegha,  Eihort,  Ghatanothoa, 
Gla'aki,  Hastur,  Ithaqua,  Nyogtha,  Quachil  Uttaus,  Rhan-

Call of CthulhuServitor Races
Particular species are often associated with particular Great 
Old Ones or Outer Gods—byakhee with Hastur, for instance, 
or nightgaunts with Nodens. These are servitor species, and 
frequently  an  Outer  God  or  Great  Old  One  manifests  ac-
companied  by  several  such  servitors.  Representatives  may 
act as assassins, messengers, spies, and delivery boys, fright-
ening  off  investigators  and  bulking  out  confrontations.  In 
comparison, Outer Gods and Great Old Ones should be met 
with exceedingly infrequently. 

The list of servitor races includes: Byakhee, Dark Young 
of Shub-Niggurath, Deep Ones, Fire Vampires, Servants of 
Gla'aki, Star-Spawn of Cthulhu, Formless Spawn, Hunting 
Horrors, Nightgaunts, Rat-Things, Sand-Dwellers, Servitors 
of  the  Outer  Gods,  Shantaks,  Spawn  of  Ubbo-Sathla,  and 
Tcho-Tchos.

Independent Races
Other alien species are also important, and sometimes have 
been  able  to  hold  their  own  against  Great  Old  Ones.  The 
independent races vary in power, and some are extinct. They 
are intimately connected with our planet, as described in At 
the Mountains of Madness and The Shadow Out of Time. In 
these  stories  Lovecraft  gives  the  true  history  of  the  Earth. 
Some species, such as dholes or flying polyps, make no asso-
ciation with particular gods or else, as with elder things and 
the Great Race, take no special interest in magic. Whether 
one is greater or lesser seems to depend on the relative dan-
ger posed by the average individual.

At the dawn of the Cambrian age, beings known only as 
the elder things flew to the Earth. They inhabited much of 
the land, warred with other species, and finally were pushed 

back  to  Antarctica.  The  elder  things,  perhaps  mistakenly, 
bred  organisms  eventually  to  evolve  into  the  dinosaurs, 
mammals, and humanity. They also bred the horrible shog-
goths,  whose  ultimate  revolt  led  to  the  near-extinction  of 
the elder things.

Aeons  ago,  indigenous  cone-shaped  beings  had  their 
minds taken over by the Great Race of Yith, mental beings 
from  the  stars.  The  Great  Race  survived  in  their  adopted 
bodies until about 50 million years ago, when they were de-
feated by terrible flying polyps not native to this Earth, which 
the Great Race had imprisoned in vast caverns beneath the 
surface.  However,  the  Great  Race  had  already  transmitted 
their minds forward in time to escape their doom.

The star-spawn of Cthulhu came down upon the Earth 
and conquered a vast reach of land in the primordial Pacific 
Ocean, but were trapped when it sank beneath the surface. 
The  beings  referred  to  as  the  fungi  from Yuggoth  (or  mi-
go) established their first bases on the Earth in the Jurassic 
period, about a hundred million years ago. They gradually 
reduced their bases to the tops of certain mountains, where 
they maintain mining colonies and such.

At present, humans share the planet with deep ones and 
ghouls (which seem related to humanity in some fashion), 
and with a handful of mi-go. Other species occasionally visit 
Earth, or are sleeping, or are dormant. 

The list of independent Races includes: Chthonians, Co-
lours Out of Space, Dholes, Dimensional Shamblers, Elder 
Things,  Flying  Polyps,  Ghasts,  Ghouls,  Gnoph-Keh,  Great 
Race  of Yith,  New  Great  Race,  Gugs,  Hounds  of  Tindalos, 
Lloigor, Mi-go, Moon-Beasts, Serpent People, Insects from 
Shaggai, Shoggoths, Star Vampires, and Beings from Xicotl.

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsAmidst the  
Ancient Trees

he daughter of a local industrialist has been kidnapped. The ransom payoff went horribly wrong, ending in a 
gunfight on the edge of the Green Mountain National Forest. The kidnappers have escaped the scene with both 
the girl and the ransom money, and fled back into the forest. 

The investigators must rescue the girl, hunt the criminals down, and bring them to justice. However, there’s 

more to be discovered in the forest than anyone ever guessed…

Introduction

Amidst the Ancient Trees takes place in the summer of 1925 in 
Southwest Vermont, though Keepers may relocate the adven-
ture’s setting and change the period to suit their gaming group. 
The  investigators  are  in  Bennington,  Vermont  and 
sign-up  to  join  the  search  party  for  the  criminals  and  the 
kidnapped girl. The scenario assumes that players will cre-
ate investigators specifically for this adventure and includes 
suggestions  for  getting  the  investigators  involved.  If  the 
adventure is to be run as part of an ongoing campaign, the 
investigators are free to bring their own reasons for signing 
up for the search party. 

This scenario emphasizes action over investigation. How-
ever, there are opportunities for investigations to take place 
at the beginning of the adventure. The Keeper may wish to 
make the players aware of this beforehand if creating charac-
ters solely for this scenario, to prevent selecting skill sets that 
will see little use. The most useful skills will be Tracking, Spot 
Hidden, Listen, Stealth, Fighting, and Firearms.

While the period would suggest that male investigators 
would join the search posse, there is no reason why female 
characters cannot do so. 

The Keeper is advised to read the descriptions of both 
Gla'aki and the servants of Gla'aki in Chapter 14: Monsters, 
Beasts and Alien Gods. 

Background
Millennia  ago,  the  Great  Old  One  known  as  Gla'aki  came 
to the Earth in a crystal prison upon a meteor. Caught by 
Earth’s gravitational field, the meteor was pulled off course 
and broke apart as it sped further towards Earth. Shards of 

the meteor and the crystal prison landed across the globe. 
One of the lesser splinters came to rest in North America. 
Though scattered, the crystal prison still has power over the 
Great Old One. Gla'aki is confined to this planet as long as 
the prison’s power remains intact. 

Over the ensuing millennia, Gla'aki has been seeking out 
these  shards  and  projecting  itself  to  other  bodies  of  water 
near where the shards of crystal have fallen. From these des-
olate places it sends out its Dream Call to lure inhabitants of 
the surrounding lands to it and, exerting itself, it manifests 
there for a brief time to convert them into undead servants. 
These  servants  are  used  to  cement  the  hold  of  Gla'aki  in 
these territories and ultimately find the shards of the crystal 
prison nearby. Once found and brought to the lake, Gla'aki 
can destroy the power within the shards. With every piece of 
the crystal it destroys, the weaker the prison becomes. One 
day Gla'aki will be able to finally escape the prison and travel 
unrestrained once more. 

In 1865, Joseph Turner and his gang of friends were con-
scripted into the Union Army. Terrified of meeting their end 
on the battlefield, the gang decided to desert and flee north 
to the Canadian border and wait out the war.

Turner and his gang fled into what would later become 
the  Green  Mountain  National  Forest,  where  they  could 
hide from the authorities on their trek north. Here, north 
of the small village of Somerset, Vermont, they encountered 
something far more terrible than the war they were escaping 
from. In the middle of the virgin wilderness, Turner and his 
men  set  up  camp  on  the  shores  of  a  lake  less  than  a  mile 
from where one of the shards of the crystal prison had come 
to  rest.  That  night,  they  heard  the  Dream  Call  of  Gla'aki. 
With the promise of eternal life they walked into the black 
waters with open arms. Here, Gla'aki took Turner and his 
men and raised them up as its undying servants. 

Over  the  last  60  years,  Turner  and  the  other  servants 

346 

Call of Cthulhuhave been slowly digging through the woods looking for the 
buried crystal. Now they have found it, buried deep in the 
ground. Very  soon  they  will  have  accomplished  their  task 
and Gla'aki will take one step closer to freedom. 

Recent Events
Summer, 1925: diggers and surveyors working on the foun-
dations for the new Somerset reservoir (named after the old 
village that is now a small logging community) found traces 
of odd mineral deposits—the remains of the meteor that fell 
to Earth millennia ago, comprised of an unknown mineral.
The deposits have defied analysis and have caused Lucas 
Strong, the new head of the Vermont Water Board and former 
owner of a successful local logging firm, a major headache. 
While the initial research says that these materials are prob-
ably  not  toxic,  Strong  is  not  prepared  to  take  the  risk—he 
would not survive the scandal if word got out that he knew 
the  site  contained  potentially  harmful  chemicals  that  could 
contaminate the water supply. With the vast majority of the 
Water Board’s budget tied up in the land, moving the reser-
voir to another location is simply not an option.

Facing potential ruin, Strong has decided to take steps 
to  ensure  he  has  done  everything  possible  to  remove  the 
threat of potential toxicity by sending a team of surveyors 
and geologists into the forest to track down other deposits 
remaining  in  the  area  of  the  drainage  basin  and  remove 
them. Having been seen to have done everything humanly 
possible, Strong believes he can face down any potential for 
scandal. However, there’s just one small snag…

Word of mouth began to circulate that Strong had sent a 
surveying team out into the forest to look for precious met-
als. While  technically  accurate,  when  those  words  reached 
the  ears  of  a  small  time  crook  named  Sidney  Harris,  he 
translated "precious metals" into "gold," and Strong became 
a target for extortion. 

Harris and his gang kidnapped Strong’s sixteen-year-old 
daughter, Jane, taking her deep into the forest to hold her 
captive in an old hunting lodge. All was going to plan until 
Harris and his men began to experience the dreams of Gla'aki 
calling to them to join with it in the lake. The dreams set the 
men  on  edge,  making  them  anxious  and  paranoid.  When 
the time came for the hand-over of the ransom money, the 
gang panicked and a gunfight with the authorities ensued. 
After gunning down several cops, Harris (who managed to 
grab the bag containing the ransom money) and one other 
wounded survivor (Eugene Clayton) fled back into the for-
est. Harris’ plan is to head back to the cabin where Jane is 
being  held.  From  there  maybe  he  can  make  a  run  for  the 
Canadian border with Dobbs and Clayton.

Meanwhile, Strong’s team were conducting their survey. 
Unfortunately  for  them,  they  strayed  a  little  too  close  to 
Gla'aki’s  lake  and  fell  fully  under  its  control,  joining  the 
Turner gang as undead servants. With more undead man-
power, as well as the team’s modern equipment, the goal of 
unearthing the crystal and delivering it to their god in the 
lake is within sight.

Timeline of Events
This is a timeline of the major events, granting the Keeper 
a frame of reference if players forge their own path through 
the scenario.

Day 0: Friday, June 19th 1925

Kidnappers: After the firefight on the edge of the forest, Sid-
ney Harris runs back into the forest with Eugene Clayton. 
The two of them don't get far that night and take refuge in 
one of the many deserted cabins throughout the forest.

Servants  of  Gla'aki:  Towards  the  end  of  the  night,  in  the 
forest near the lake, the servants of Gla'aki raid the Artists’ 
camp, having been told by their god that there are intruders 
in the nearby area.

Artists  and  Hunters:  The  artists,  along  with  two  hunters 
(Brian and Arthur Hall), are captured, taken to the dig site 
by the servants of Gla'aki and locked in Hut 4 to await their 
conversion.  One  of  the  artists  escapes,  and  though  fatally 
wounded,  and  begins  to  make  his  way  back  towards  Ben-
nington to seek help.

Day 1: Saturday, June 20th 1925

Investigators: Play starts with the investigators arriving at 
the town meeting.

Kidnappers:  Sidney  Harris  makes  it  over  halfway  back  to 
the  hideout  where  Dobbs  holds  the  girl.  Eugene  Clayton 
is injured, covering only half the distance Harris is able to, 
and that night shoots at one of the wandering servants of 
Gla'aki.

Servants  of  Gla'aki:  During  the  night,  the  servants  of 
Gla'aki raid the hideout where Jane Strong is held, Christo-
pher Dobbs, who is holding her, is killed in the confronta-
tion. They take her to their camp and put her with the other 
prisoners.

Artists:  Most  are  now  captive  or  dead;  however,  one  has 
managed to flee and finally collapses from blood loss, dying 
not far from wherever the investigators have camped for the 
night.

Day 2: Sunday, June 21st 1925

Kidnappers: Sidney Harris reaches the hideout in the late 
afternoon to find the girl gone. He beds down there, with 
the plan of setting off the next morning for the Canadian 
border. That night the servants of Gla'aki assault the hide-
out; however Harris uses his gun to keep them at bay.

Servants  of  Gla'aki:  Conduct  the  largest  blast  (which  the 
investigators  will  witness  from  afar),  which  finally  frees 
the crystal shard. They will begin lifting it tomorrow. The 
servants go back to the hideout to collect Harris.

The artists: The servants of Gla'aki take the five artists down 
to the edge of the lake to be converted (Jane Strong and two 
other captives are held at the dig site).

Day 3: Monday, June 22nd 1925

The artists: Down by the lakeside, slowly being converted 
into servants of Gla'aki.

Kidnappers:  Now  insane,  Harris  has  barricaded  himself 
into his cabin. He remains there until the investigators find 
him.

Servants of Gla'aki: The newer servants are working at the 
dig-site.

Investigators:  This  is  where  the  investigators  are  most 
likely to alter the course of events. If undead workers are not 
stopped,  the  crystal  is  pulled  out  of  the  pit  just  after  sun-
down and taken to the lake. The newly converted prisoners 
are untied and return to the dig-site to collect the remaining 
prisoners for conversion.

The Thing in the lake: If the crystal is delivered to the lake, 
the Great Old One has achieved its goal in the forest.

Call of CthulhuInvestigator Motivations
When  running  Amidst  the  Ancient  Trees  as  a  standalone 
adventure  it  is  recommended  that  the  investigators  have 
motivations to join the posse formed to track down Harris. 
These  motivations  work  best  when  tied  into  the  scenario 
background, but could be more generic. 

Presented below are some optional investigator motiva-
tions,  which  can  either  be  handed-out  randomly  during 
investigator creation, or discussed with the players, allowing 
them to shape the motivations more closely with their char-
acter  concepts.  The  players  may  be  encouraged  to  follow 
their motivations, with a promise of a Sanity point reward 
at the end of the scenario if all goes well.

These  motivations  are  purely  optional.  Players  should 
not  feel  obliged  to  use  them  if  they  don’t  believe  they  fit 
their character concepts.

Suggested Investigator Motivations:
One
You’ve gotten yourself into a dire financial situation. Debts 
to the bank, the mortgage company, and so on. In your des-
peration you turned to a loan shark. You have until the end 
of the week to get the cash or the loan shark will start break-
ing bones. All you need is $1000 and you’re in the clear…

Keeper  note:  Mr.  Strong,  funding  the  posse  with  his 
own money, is offering $25 per day for everyone involved. 
It won’t take many days to find Harris, so the player can try 
to barter for more pay or to get another investigator’s share. 
There’s  also  the  option  of  the  ransom  that  Harris  ran  off 
with.  Strong  wants  it  back,  but  the  desperate  investigator 
could always try to snatch it.

Two

John, your brother, used to work for Lucas Strong and his 
water company. He used to tell you about how much of a 
miser Strong was. The man wouldn’t give you a dime if your 
life depended on it. Your brother got fired just because he 
wanted to save a few bucks. He did nothing wrong and it’s 
just damned unfair. Now that something’s happened to his 
daughter,  he’s  throwing  cash  around  that  could  have  kept 
your brother in his job. It’s time to do what’s right… 

Keeper note: This is potentially one of the darker moti-
vations and is open for the player to interpret. Some possible 
interpretations: try to extort more cash from Strong; try to 
get the brother his job back; the player might even kidnap 
Jane and use her as leverage over Strong, etc. This could lead 
to some interesting intra-party conflicts if the player pushes 
in the wrong direction at the wrong time.

Three

You used to work for Lucas Strong until you messed up. Sure 
it was your mistake, but people make mistakes. One misun-
derstanding with a client and you were fired. Since then you 
have survived on makeshift work, although money is tight. 

Now Strong really needs someone to get his daughter back. 
You’re  the  right  person  for  the  job.  All  you  need  to  do  is 
show him what you can do and he’ll take you back and your 
worries will be over. 

Keeper  note:  In  this  instance,  the  investigator  could 
try to take charge of the posse, becoming the team leader. 
Rather than a monetary reward, the investigator might seek 
to be reinstated in his or her job. This might even involve 
attempts to influence any testimony Jane gives if she is res-
cued. 

Four

You and Sidney Harris and his gang go way back. You grew 
up  together  but  you  weren’t  friends.  Harris  used  to  make 
your  life  a  misery.  Once  a  bully,  always  a  bully…  You’ve 
made  good  for  yourself  since  then  and  Harris  is  down  in 
the gutter. Now it’s you who gets to come out on top. This 
is your chance to get revenge on him, acting in the name of 
the law…

Keeper: note This could be interpreted either as captur-
ing Harris and getting him back to town to face justice, or as 
motivation for personal revenge. 

Investigator motivations could be dealt randomly to 
the players. You may wish to create additional moti-
vations if you have more than four players. Randomly 
issuing motivations like these is a technique that you 
may  choose  to  use  in  future  scenarios.  A  reward  of 
1D6 points of Sanity is also offered as an incentive to 
the players. A little addition like this goes a long way 
towards  kick-starting  the  game  and  inspiring  some 
unforeseeable outcomes. 

Day 1: Briefing
Read the boxed text out loud to the players: 

The streets of Bennington are buzzing with news and 
gossip  about  the  gunfight  last  night  on  the  edge  of 
the forest. There is talk of police cars, sirens, shotgun 
blasts and escaped kidnappers. The locals are saying 
that three gangsters were killed and two police officers 
were shot—some say wounded, others say dead. Post-
ers are going up across town saying that the sheriff is 
organizing a manhunt to find Lucas Strong’s missing 
daughter and catch the escaped gangsters.  Everyone 
in  town  is  invited  to  the  meeting  at  the  Police  Sta-
tion. Rumor has it that Mr. Strong has announced a 
$5,000 reward for the safe return of his daughter and 
is willing to pay anyone who can aid in her rescue.

349 

chapter 15: scenariosThe scenario begins at 10 am with the investigators attend-
ing the briefing at the Police Station. Sheriff Jenkins explains 
the background to what’s happened:

G  Sidney  Harris  and  his  gang  have  kidnapped  Jane 

Strong, daughter of Lucas Strong. 

G  Harris  demanded  a  ransom  of  $10,000  for  Jane’s 
return, and a hand-over was arranged for last night 
at the edge of town.

G  All  seemed  to  be  going  smoothly  until  Harris  and 
his men got twitchy and lead started flying. Chaos 
ensued with both sides shooting it out.

G  After  shooting  two  police  officers,  Harris  and  one 
other member of his gang got away with the ransom 
money. 

G  The  escapees  have  fled  back  into  the  forest,  where 

they are believed to be holding Jane.

G  Lucas  Strong  is  in  attendance  and  adds  that  he  is 
personally offering the $25 per day to anyone who 
joins the hunt. He adds that he would consider it a 
“real kindness” if Harris’ dead body was also brought 
back. He reiterates the message on the posters seen 
around town, that he’s willing to pay anyone who is 
willing  to  help, “Man  or  woman,  black  or  white,  I 
don’t care. Just bring my little girl home and you’ll 
be paid!”

If the investigators wish to question the sheriff or Strong 
further they may do so, although both know little more than 
what’s already been said. If the investigators press Strong for 
more money or make a scene, the sheriff will take objection 
and warn the investigators to mind their manners.

The  volunteers  are  then  grouped  together,  with  the 
investigators placed in the same team. They are given until 
noon (two hours) in which to get their supplies and equip-
ment together. 

Investigators  wishing  to  buy  additional  weapons  or 
equipment may do so from Arthur J. Spence’s Hardware and 
Gun Store on Main Street (refer to equipment and weapon 
lists on pages 396–406).  

Should the investigators go looking for unusual equip-
ment  then  Luck  rolls  may  be  called  for.  Remember  that 
this is essentially a frontier town and so some items will be 
impossible to buy in the time the investigators have.

Anyone  wanting  to  work  out  the  route  that  Harris  is 
using  might  look  to  the  local  library  or  newspaper  office. 
Both carry an archive of the Bennington Banner. There are 
numerous  articles  going  back  to  the  Civil  War  (no  Library 
Use roll required) about the forest being used as a hideout for 
fugitives trying to evade conscription into the Union Army. 
Many are believed to have fled to the Canadian border. More 
recent articles describe Strong’s plan for the reservoir and the 
fact that he has recently sent out a geological team to survey 
for precious minerals in what will become the reservoir’s bed.
Investigators  may  also  try  to  pick  up  information  by 
word  of  mouth  (such  as  at  the  hardware  and  gun  store). 

It’s common knowledge that hunting parties often venture 
out into the forest and hunters return with plenty of good 
stories. One thing that stands out is that none of the hunt-
ers like to stay out in the forest for long and none of them 
venture too far into the heart of the wood as there is “less 
game to be found there.” Additionally, the investigators may 
hear of a group of artists from the city who have recently 
headed into forest. No one seems to know who the artists are 
or what they are doing. 

Investigators wishing to pick up any more information by 
word of mouth may also hear stories from the more supersti-
tious townsfolk concerning odd events in the woods over the 
years. Such tales might weave fantasies of Indian burial grounds 
(a red herring), an ancient buried evil (potentially alluding to 
the presence of Gla'aki, but also foreshadowing the buried crys-
tal), and ghosts of Civil War deserters that roam throughout 
the night (specifically including the name of Joseph Turner).

The Keeper is encouraged to use rumors to drop subtle 
hints about what dangers might await the investiga-
tors. The players will be wondering what they are fac-
ing and hints will fuel their imaginations. Take note 
of any speculation the players make; sometimes they 
will  think  of  things  that  are  more  frightening  than 
those in the scenario! Always be ready to incorporate 
some  of  these  ideas  later.  Alternatively  you  might 
respond to something a player says in the voice of a 
non-player character, “What’s that sonny? You talkin’ 
‘bout ghosts? I done seen one, one time when I was 
out a fishin’ by the lake…”

Keepers  are  encouraged  to  let  the  investigators  hear 
various rumors relating to Strong’s wayward daughter, his 
financial and business dealings, and the strange goings-on 
in the forest.

By noon, the various groups of volunteers who comprise 
the posse have gathered in the town square. The sheriff di-
rects each group to a general area of the forest in which to 
focus their search. The idea is that the individual groups will 
form a noose that gradually tightens towards the center of 
the forest. The investigator’s group is told to take a north-
easterly route and follow that line to beyond the boundary 
of what will become the reservoir. 

The investigators are among the first groups to be shown 
to  their  starting  point:  the  scene  of  the  shoot-out  of  the 
previous night. The site is a newly formed clearing about a 
hundred yards across on the edge of the forest, forming part 
of a wider area marked for logging. A dirt track from the main 
road  heads  over  a  small  field  to  the  edge  of  the  clearing.  It 
is littered with short stumps and a couple of piles of fallen 
tree-trunks, surrounded by tall, looming trees that stand close 
together. Scattered over the site is evidence of the events of the 
previous night: discarded shotgun shells and bullet casings; 
bullet holes in the trees and stumps; and a couple of heavy 

350 

Call of Cthulhuroundings, call for Listen rolls. Those succeeding hear the 
sound of wood breaking up ahead. 

Anyone  who  made  the  Listen  roll  may  also  attempt  a 
Spot Hidden roll to spot a pair of people with rifles ahead 
of them on the trail. Those who failed the Listen roll may 
attempt a Hard Spot Hidden roll (needing equal to or under 
half their skill to succeed). The pair, a man and a boy, are 
both carrying rifles and packs.

If  the  hunters  aren’t  seen  or  heard,  their  presence  will 
become known when the investigators hear gunshots ahead. 
If any of the investigators are wearing brightly colored cloth-
ing then there are no gunshots, as they are not mistaken for 
potential game, and the man and boy walk forward, making 
their presence known in a much more friendly manner.

If  the  investigators  spot  the  hunting  party  before  the 
shots are taken, contact can be made by waving or crying a 
“hello,” otherwise ask the investigators to make a group Luck 
roll (see Luck, page 90). A failed group Luck roll means that 
a random investigator has been mistaken for a wild animal 
at a distance and shot at by the hunters for 1D3 damage—
the bullet scoring a glancing hit. Such damage manifests as a 
flesh wound rather than a serious injury. Notice that there is 
no need to roll to hit—this was a random incident and the 
damage is a result of the failed Luck roll.

The  resulting  scream  and  possible  gunfire  back  will 
bring  cries  of “DON’T  SHOOT!”  from  the  hunting  party, 
who are as scared as hell and very apologetic. 

The  hunting  party  comprises  Alistair  Lawson  and  his 
14-year-old son, George, who came from Boston on a camp-
ing trip with their neighbors, Brian Hall and his 12-year-old 
son,  Arthur,  to  teach  their  boys  to  how  to  hunt.  They  are 
completely unaware of the manhunt and haven’t heard any-
thing odd in the area—besides the occasional rumbling of a 
truck up on the trail heading north towards the reservoir dig 
site. They’ve only been out three days and haven’t ventured 
far into the forest.

Brian  and  Arthur  Hall  went  deeper  into  the  forest  a 
couple of days back and haven’t been seen since. The Law-
sons have been keeping to the edge of the forest to look for 
deer, plus (Alistair says quietly) George was getting scared at 
night, so they pulled back to the wood’s edge. 

If the investigators talk to George about being scared, he 
will say that both he and his dad were having bad dreams. 
He doesn’t remember what they were about. Both son and 
father are reluctant to say more; however if pressed, Alistair 
says that he kept dreaming he was drowning.

They agree that they won’t get in the posse’s way and urge 
for them to look out for Brian and Arthur. “You can’t miss 
Brian.  He’s  got  a  big  ol’  Texan  hat  he  brought  with  him  to 
keep  out  of  the  sun.” Alistair  also  mentions  that  they  came 
across a group of artists camping out in the woods quite some 
way into the forest. “They said they were from back home as 
well, from the University of Boston. They’re working on some 
assignment.  Painting  the  wildlife  and  landscapes,  they  said. 
We  bumped  into  them  a  few  days  ago  and  they  said  if  we 
passed back that way to drop in for some coffee. Keep an eye 
out for them. I hope they don’t get caught up in all this.”

The Briefing

bloodstains where the police officers were gunned down. The 
area  is  otherwise  still  and  ominously  quiet.  From  here,  the 
investigators are directed to head northeast. 

Evidence of two men running into the forest is quickly 
discovered by anyone searching the area. These are the tracks 
left by Sidney Harris and Eugene Clayton.  

As the characters set off from the edge of the woods, 
you may begin to call for Tracking rolls to find the di-
rection the kidnappers took. If the players constantly 
fail the tracking rolls the investigators progress will be 
slow and hazardous. Feel free to incorporate some of 
the  negative  outcomes  listed  in  the  section  Pushing 
Skill Rolls  in  the Forest (see  page  353).  Ultimately 
the investigators must find the tracks, otherwise there 
will  be  no  scenario.  Successful  tracking  rolls  should 
provide  a  slight  advantage  to  the  players,  allowing 
them to anticipate encounters rather than being sur-
prised or disadvantaged by them.

Day 1: Meeting the Hunting Party
For the first few hours of trekking through the forest all the 
investigators will see is the occasional glimpse of deer run-
ning between the thickets. 

At this point, ask each player to describe how their inves-
tigator is dressed, if they have not done so already. If none 
of them have specifically made the choice to wear brightly 
colored clothing that makes them stand out from their sur-

351 

chapter 15: scenariosWhoever  is  awake  around  midnight  may 
attempt  a  Listen  roll.  Success  means  that  the  in-
vestigator can make out the faint sound of a truck 
engine  in  the  far  distance  somewhere  ahead,  but 
they can see no lights. On another occasion they 
will hear a flurry of rifle fire, but too far away to 
pinpoint. The gunfire is Eugene Clayton shooting 
at one of the passing undead servants (see Day 2: 
The First Kidnapper, see following page). 

If  the  investigators  decide  to  move  onwards 
after hearing the sound of rifle fire in the middle 
of the night, call for Hard CON rolls. Those that 
fail the CON roll simply can’t go on as exhaustion 
takes over. The investigators are unlikely to locate 
Eugene that night. If they do wander far, the Keeper 
may choose to have another encounter that night, 
either  Day  2:  The  artist’s  body  (see  following 
page) or Day 2: The Truck (see following page).

Day 2: Moving Through the 
Forest
The  next  day,  the  posse  are  entering  the  heart 
of  the  forest.  Strangely,  there  are  fewer  signs  or 
sounds of animals this far in. 

Day 2: The Artist’s Body
As the posse continue on through the forest, call 
for  Tracking  and  Spot  Hidden  rolls.  Those  suc-
ceeding with Spot Hidden discover blood-spatters 
across  their  path  upon  the  ground.  Those  who 
pass  Tracking  rolls  notice  that  the  foliage  has 
been  disturbed,  with  broken  twigs  and  branches 
that  imply  someone  was  running  while  injured 
through here recently. 

If they choose to follow the trail, it detours away from their 
intended path, but not enough that they can’t double back later. 
A  half-mile  down  the  trail  a  discarded  hunting  knife  is 
found. It is old, rusty, and covered in sticky, semi-dried blood. 
A little way farther from this lies the body of one of the artists 
who escaped the raid on their camp (see Day 3: The Artists’ 
Camp, page 355). Seeing the torn-up corpse costs 0/1D3 SAN 
for those not accustomed to the sight of death. 

The male body doesn’t have any identification; however, 
the  overall  he  is  wearing  is  flecked  with  paint.  There  is  a 
(knife)  wound  to  his  side  that  he’s  attempted  to  bandage 
poorly. Medicine or First Aid rolls will determine he bled 
out steadily for the last day or so before finally collapsing. 

The  investigators  should  decide  whether  to  follow  the 
trail made by the dead man back to its origin or to put that 
aside for now and continue hunting Harris. 

Those deciding to follow the dead man’s tracks will need to 
make a Tracking roll and spend the rest of the day searching to 
find the artists’ camp (see Day 3: The artists’ camp, page 355). It 
is at the Keeper’s discretion whether the investigators encounter 
the remaining events of Day 2 (see Day 2: The Truck and Day 2: 
The First Kidnapper) before or after they come upon the camp. 

Day 1: The First Night
Finding a clearing in which to set up camp is relatively easy 
this far into the forest. The investigators can bed down for 
the  night  without  issue,  though  the  Keeper  should  imply 
that danger is ever-present.

Given  the  impending  recovery  of  the  crystal,  Gla'aki’s 
attention is focused on its existing servants and thus is not 
actively  calling  the  investigators  to  become  new  servants. 
However, all within the forest are subject to the psychic dis-
turbance caused by Gla'aki’s presence, manifested through 
bad dreams.

During  the  night,  call  for  POW  rolls.  Those  that  pass 
have uninterrupted sleep and suffer no ill effects. Those fail-
ing the POW roll are susceptible to Gla'aki’s Dream Call and 
should be given a randomly selected Dream Call Handout 
(see page 363). Where noted on the handout, call for a San-
ity  roll  for  each  investigator  affected  (applying  the  Sanity 
point loss as noted). Keep note of which player has received 
which handout. Reflect upon the investigator’s backstories 
and consider weaving some aspect of an investigator’s back-
story into their dream.

352 

Call of CthulhuPushing Skill Rolls in 
the Forest
If the investigators are not willing to give up after hav-
ing  failed  a  skill  roll,  they  may  persevere.  Remember 
that it is up to the players to explain what actions their 
investigator is taking, and for you as Keeper do decide 
if a pushed roll is warranted.

The  consequence  of  failing  a  pushed  roll  should 
always  be  derived  from  the  situation.  Here  are  a  few 
suggestions for consequences of failing pushed rolls in 
the forest:

The  investigators  inadvertently  stumble  upon  a 
lone  black  bear  (see  Bear,  Chapter  14:  Monsters, 
Beasts,  and  Alien  Gods,  page  336)  and  rile  it  with 
their appearance. After inflicting some damage on the 
investigators, the bear flees. 

Another posse hears the investigators pass by their 
camp and take potshots at them, believing them to be 
the kidnappers. This could run very much like Meeting 
the Hunting Party (see page 351).

The investigators set up camp or take a rest break 
in the clearing. It is actually the road used by the truck 
(see Day 2: The Truck, see below). Perhaps the group 
doze off and are awoken as the truck is almost upon 
them. Ask for DEX rolls to clear their equipment from 
the path of the truck.

A wandering servant of Gla'aki spies the investiga-

tors and an assault is planned.

Something  important  is  lost  by  an  investigator. 

Perhaps a rifle, propped against tree and forgotten.

The forest is full of hazards. An investigator might 
fall, be bitten by a snake or insect, suffer bad blisters, 
and so on. 

Day 2: The Truck
The posse stumbles across a trail of tire tracks that have cut 
through the forest floor. Given it’s snaking roughly north-
east, a successful Navigation roll can plot that the track is 
heading into the area north of Somerset. Anyone with local 
knowledge knows there are nothing but trees and the occa-
sional small lake there. 

Shortly  afterwards,  the  posse  hears  the  distant  sound 
of an engine (the same as that possibly heard by those on 
watch the night before). James Stanton is the truck’s driver. 
He’s  one  of  the  engineers  from  Strong’s  survey  team  and 
has recently become a servant of Gla'aki. He is still human 
in appearance, though he has a terrible wound in his chest 
(where one of Gla'aki’s spines was inserted), which he has 

The Artist's Body

concealed under his coat. He’s a little distant and hostile to 
anyone  blocking  his  way,  looking  at  them  sternly  and  de-
manding they get off the trail. Don’t play him as a mindless 
zombie, but he should feel cold and lacking in emotion.

Stanton  will  object  to  the  posse  trying  to  search  the 
truck  but  won’t  actively  try  to  stop  them.  There  are  no 
fugitives within, but there are several crates of dynamite. He 
explains that he’s on the geological survey being headed up 
by Carl White, under the direction of Mr. Strong. 

Stanton claims to know nothing about the kidnapping, 
however  is  interested  to  hear  that  there  might  be  people 
around their camp, so he will keep an eye out for them. He 
won’t take the investigators to the dig site/base  camp,  but 
will say that it would be fine to visit them, “Just follow the 
road and it will get you there eventually.” Unless prevented, 
he then drives off. 

Day 2: The First Kidnapper
A little before dusk, call for Hard Spot Hidden rolls. Those 
succeeding  catch  the  glint  of  light  off  Eugene  Clayton’s 
rifle-scope  from  his  vantage  point  on  a  ridge  up  ahead. A 
group Luck roll determines if Eugene has spotted the inves-
tigators approaching. 

If he has spotted them, Eugene will fire a shot over their 
heads in an effort to scare them off. He only has three shots 
left after this, having used most of his ammunition the pre-
vious night shooting in the darkness at the passing undead 
servant. See Eugene’s profile in the Non-Player Characters 
section, page 361. If he hasn’t spotted them, the investigators 
may attempt to make Stealth rolls to attempt to get the drop 
on him. 

353 

chapter 15: scenariosThe investigators can take cover easily once the warning 
shot  has  been  fired,  but  getting  to  the  kidnapper  without 
being shot would require a successful Stealth roll. A failed 
roll will leave an investigator exposed and possibly a target. 
Any investigator trying to flee the area will not be a target 
for Eugene. 

Any investigators who are caught out in the open trying 
to make a full-frontal assault on Eugene leave him no choice: 
he will try to shoot them dead. However, given he is badly 
injured after being shot by the police two nights ago, all his 
combat rolls are made with a penalty die (see page 91).

If the investigators manage to advance far enough, or if 
he runs out of ammunition, Eugene will try to flee rather 
than stand and fight. A chase may ensue, although Eugene’s 
rolls should be at a penalty due to his injuries (see Chapter 
7:  Chases).  If  he  escapes,  the  Keeper  should  decide  when 
he  will  reappear.  Potentially,  the  investigators  could  en-
counter him again at any point, either following his tracks 
and catching him exhausted after a successful Track roll, or 
perhaps  during  a  later  event  as  he  makes  his  way  towards 
the hideout.

If caught or cornered at gunpoint, Eugene will surren-
der,  demanding  that  the  posse  take  him  back  to  the  town 
to  get  medical  attention.  Eugene  is  suffering  from  a  fever, 
wounded from the shootout (blasted by a police shotgun), 
and  claims  he’s  delirious—he  states  he  took  a  pot  shot  at 
someone  he  saw  last  night  and  he  swears  he  hit,  but  the 
figure just walked off! 

  Eugene  will  say  anything  to  pin  the  kidnapping  (and 
any other crimes he thinks he’ll be blamed for) on Harris, 
claiming  he  was  bullied  into  it.  If  questioned  about  Jane 
Strong, he will say that she was looked after and was healthy 
when he last saw her before the shoot-out. He will provide 
directions to the hideout cabin in which she is held.

The  investigators  have  the  option  to  follow  Eugene’s 

directions or pick up Harris’ tracks again.

Day 2: The Second Night
The investigators have travelled far into the heart of the for-
est now and are now much closer to where Gla'aki dwells, its 
inhuman thoughts drifting on the winds of dream. 

All  investigators  will  experience  Gla'aki’s  Dream  Call 
on  this  night  (regardless  of  whether  they  have  previously 
experienced it). Each investigator randomly selects a Dream 
Call Handout (see page 363), excluding “A Restless Night” 
from this selection. The Keeper should call for Sanity rolls 
for the relevant dreams (applying the SAN loss as noted on 
each handout). 

Ask  those  on  guard  duty  to  make  an  Extreme  Spot 
Hidden roll (requiring the player to roll equal to or below 
one-fifth of their skill). If the roll is failed, the investigator 
concerned gets the impression of being watched. Those who 
succeed notice something moving in the darkness. 

The  watcher  in  the  dark  is  one  of  Gla'aki’s  undead 
servants  (Louis—one  of  Turner’s  gang,  see  Non-Player 
Characters  on  page  361),  patrolling  the  woods  after  the 
other  servants  have  been  alerted  to  the  fact  that  there  are 

Chasing the Kidnapper 
Through the Forest
The series of locations that make up this chase will all 
be forest-based; for example:

G  Steep muddy slope, requiring a Climb roll.
G  Brook, requiring a Jump roll.
G  An  area  thick  with  young  trees,  requiring  a 

DEX roll to weave rapidly through.

If Eugene gains a lead of three locations you may 
wish to ask for Spot Hidden rolls to keep him in view, 
or Track rolls to follow his trail.

a lot of people out in the woods at the moment who could 
disrupt their mission. If left alone, Louis will slink back to-
ward the dig site to report to Turner. If followed, the undead 
monstrosity  will  conduct  a  swift  attack  to  cause  as  much 
confusion as possible, aiming to disappear into the forest. 

If  cornered,  Louis  doesn’t  want  to  risk  a  fight  to  the 
death,  so  will  wait  until  he  receives  a  blow  of  reasonable 
force to make it look feasible for him to play dead; as he is 
a walking corpse, it succeeds automatically. When left alone 
or with only minimal attention being paid to him, Louis will 
escape into the darkness. 

At midnight, everyone will be awoken by an explosion 
somewhere in the distance to the north. This is the survey 
team  blowing  the  rocks  free  from  the  crystal  monolith. 
Even though the echo of the blast dies away quickly, a faint 
blue light can be seen lingering, reflected off the base of the 
clouds for a few moments. 

Not  long  after,  there’s  a  rustling  ahead  (Listen  roll  to 
detect the noise in advance) and another posse team appears 
out of the darkness. They have had enough of the forest and 
the bad dreams—although, unless pressed, they will claim 
that they are just tired and sick, having eaten some bad meat 
(Psychology  roll  to  detect  that  they  are  lying).  They  are 
heading back to town.

Day 3: Moving Through the Forest
The investigators are near the lake and thus begin to feel and 
see  the  effects  of  Gla'aki’s  Dream  Call.  The  forest  canopy 
grows thick, leaving the investigators walking in a dim half-
light where the trees appear twisted in pain, and the color of 
the undergrowth is unnaturally pale-sickly yellow. Call for 
Listen rolls, with those succeeding realizing that there is no 
sound of wildlife at all (Sanity roll, 0/1 SAN loss).

Call of CthulhuThe paintings found at the Artists' camp.

Day 3: The Artists’ Camp
The artists’ camp is not far from the trail used by the trucks 
heading to the dig site. The campfire has long since died, the 
tents are broken and there are signs of a struggle or fight. 
Turner and his gang came in the dead of night, taking the 
artists  to  the  lake  as  an  offering  to  their  god  (converting 
them into new servants, see Day 3: The Lake, page 358). 

One  of  the  six  artists  staying  there  managed  to  escape 
the attack, but not before being badly wounded. This is the 
unfortunate  whom  the  investigators  have  already  found 
dead (see Day 2: The Artist’s Body, page 352).

There  are  four  sleeping  tents,  two  of  which  look  they 
have  been  home  to  a  man  and  woman,  with  only  single 
occupants in the other two. There are two other, larger tents. 
One of these is a large communal tent, apparently used for 
cooking, although the stove is long since cold. The last tent 
is also comparatively large and seems to be have been used 
as  a  painting  studio.  Easels  lie  broken,  paint,  and  brushes 
appear crushed and canvases litter the floor. 

A search of the sleeping tents reveals a notebook, various 
art pads, and some partly completed oil canvases. In addition, 
a Spot Hidden roll reveals a discarded rifle and Texan hat in a 
nearby bush, next to drag marks heading northwards (in the 
direction of the dig site). This should remind the investiga-

tors of Alistair Lawson’s parting words to them from Day 1: 
Meeting the Hunting Party (see page 351) about Brian Hall. 
Looking  through  the  notebook  reveals  that  the  artists 
are from Boston and that they came here to paint for their 
art  course.  The  latest  entries  describe  frightening  dreams 
(uncannily similar to those the investigators are experienc-
ing), and how they met Brian and Arthur Hall, who claim to 
have been experiencing the same dreams. 

The  art  pads  and  canvases  show  a  range  of  paintings, 

mostly of landscapes and woodland scenes:

G An owl on a branch, peering out into the dark. 
G  A  deer  looking  through  the  trees  in  an  otherwise 

deserted wood.

G The moon shining down through the trees above. 
G A path snaking its way through the trees, the ground 

covered in dead, yellow leaves. [DREAM]

G A dilapidated old cabin, the door open and the dark 

outline of a figure within. [DREAM]

G A figure seen from behind, looking out onto the black 
waters as something horrible rises up out of the lake. 
[DREAM]

chapter 15: scenariosAs the investigators enter the clearing, 
they detect the smell of death. The stench 
comes  from  a  blood-soaked  tree,  where 
impaled  through  the  chest  on  a  branch 
halfway  up  is  Christopher  Dobbs—the 
member of the gang left to guard the girl. 
Call for Sanity rolls, with 0/1D4 SAN loss 
due to the gruesome nature of the death. 
The cabin is shot through with many 
bullet  holes.    If  investigated  further,  it 
appears the bullets were fired from within.
Distracted  by  the  discovery  of  the 
body,  the  investigators  are  most  likely 
unaware  that  Harris  is  alive  within  the 
cabin.  When  he  hears  the  investigators, 
he  will  open  fire  from  inside  the  cabin 
with his shotgun (take note that shotgun 
damage is decreased with range, and that 
shotgun attacks do not impale). He yells, 
“Give her back or get the hell away!” He 
is  crazy  from  the  Dream  Call  of  Gla'aki 
and has been fending off undead servants 
throughout the night. Unless the investi-
gators can incapacitate or calm him (Ex-
treme  Persuade,  Charm,  or  Intimidate 
roll),  he  will  continue  shooting,  fearing 
the investigators are more of the horrors 
come to get him. 

If the investigators manage to pacify 
Harris,  he  will  explain  that  the  girl  is 
gone. He found Dobbs dead the previous 
evening, and he was attacked in the night 
(by the servants). Once he has said this, 
he will collapse into hysteria.

If  an  investigator  has  already  experienced  something 
similar to one of the paintings in a dream, the player con-
cerned should make a Sanity roll, losing the same amount as 
originally prompted by the dream. Apply the usual rule here 
to limit cumulative loss from one source. Thus if the SAN 
loss for the particular dream is 1D6, the maximum that can 
be lost for having the dream and then seeing the painting is 
a total of 6 Sanity points.

The  investigators  may  be  following  Eugene’s  direction 
or Harris’ tracks. Alternatively they might track the artists’ 
attackers towards the lake.

Day 3: The Hideout
In  a  clearing  stands  an  old  cabin.  The  door  is  closed  and 
there’s no sign of movement. 

Day 3: Turner’s Cabin
Heading  back  to  the  tracks  through  the 
forest,  the  posse  finds  it  divides  in  two. 
One  road  looks  recently  used,  the  other 
less  so.  Freshly  fallen  leaves  lie  on  the 
forest floor, an event that shouldn’t hap-
pen until the Fall. Anyone who has experienced the Dream 
Call handout "A Path Through the Forest" will recognize the 
lesser-used road as part of the path from their dream (Sanity 
roll, 0/1 SAN loss). If they advance down the recently used 
track, go to Day 3: The Dig Site (see page 358). 

If  they  advance  down  the  older,  less  used  track,  they 
come upon a clearing to the left where another, older cabin 
resides: Turner’s cabin. This is instantly familiar to anyone 
who has experienced the Dream Call handout "A Cabin in 
Darkness" as being the cabin from their dream (Sanity roll, 
1/1D6 SAN loss, as the horror of the initial dream is relived 
in their mind). The trail continues past the clearing as well, 
to Day 3: The Lake (see page 358).

Inside,  there  are  Civil  War  Union  army  uniforms  and 
hats  hung  upon  pegs,  bloodstained  hunting  knives  on  the 
table,  and  long-dead  animals  hanging  from  hooks  in  the 

356 

Call of CthulhuG Some small traces of the green dust-like decay is still 
present, having fallen from the servants while inside. 
Science (Biology or Botany) rolls are unable to dis-
cern exactly what this substance is beyond possibly 
being some kind of decaying fungus or mold. 

The  Keeper  is  encouraged  to  relay  the  information 
found  in  the  diary  verbally  to  build  atmosphere.  There  is 
no handout presented here, allowing the Keeper to control 
how much information the investigators get from the diary 
about the events leading up to their transformation into un-
dead servants—reveal as little or as much as you wish. Only 
the  last,  most  important  passage  of  the  diary  is  presented 
below to be read aloud to the investigators:

At last our journey is over. We fled the army to escape 
with our lives and make a new start in Canada, but 
instead  we  have  found  that  which  we  desire  on  the 
shores of the black lake north of Somerset. It called us 
here with the promise of life everlasting. It called us 
here in our dreams. It exists here and yet not here at 
the same time. It remains trapped in a crystal prison 
from which it longs to be freed. It came here so many 
centuries ago upon a comet that broke apart and was 
scattered  around  the  world.  One  such  piece  landed 
here, with part of the crystal that keeps it bound. If 
we aid it in finding the crystal and deliver it the lake, 
our benefactor can destroy it, weakening the strength 
of  the  prison  that  binds  it.  One  day  it  shall  ascend 
to the stars and we shall bask in its eternal gratitude 
and power. It is the one true God, the one true master 
over life and death. We go to join with it in the black 
waters of the lake. We go now to be made immortal by 
our new God. Gla'aki, may your will be done.

Otherwise, at night, the caskets are all partially open and 

empty as the servants are all at the dig site. 

If August or Jacob are present and their caskets are dis-
covered, they emerge and attempt to win the investigators 
to  their  cause.  They  avoid  combat,  as  they  are  vulnerable 
during the day, instead promoting the benefits of the eter-
nal life that awaits them. Gla'aki’s undead servants are not 
mindless; they are cunning and aim to entice the investiga-
tors to the lake once it grows dark. 

If  the  investigators  start  a  fight  or  attempt  to  leave, 
August  and  Jacob  will  attack  and  try  to  incapacitate  them 
before placing them in the empty caskets. Here, they will be 
imprisoned, awaiting the cover of darkness when they can 
be taken to the lake to be converted. Once their prisoners are 
secure, they return to their own caskets to wait till nightfall. 
Even with three caskets unoccupied, there is still plenty 
of room for the investigators, since each one is large enough 
to squeeze two people inside. Once trapped inside, the blue 
light provides limited illumination. The lid is firmly sealed 
in place when it slides shut, not just by the physical weight 
of  the  lid,  but  by  the  magical  properties  invested  in  it  by 
Gla'aki.  Opening  a  casket  requires  a  Hard  STR  or  POW 

What the investigators find inside Turner's Cabin.

ceiling. There is no evidence of cooking. An old Civil War-
era rifle stands in one corner. It has not been maintained; its 
mechanism is rusted and jammed. 

A Spot Hidden roll reveals a pale-blue light creeping up 
from the gaps in the floorboards. A trapdoor can be found, 
which  leads  down  to  an  earthen  basement.  The  pale-blue 
light emanates from a set of five blue stone caskets that the 
undead  servants  use  to  sleep  in  during  the  day,  shielding 
themselves from the harmful sunlight (they can take cover 
elsewhere but prefer these caskets). These caskets are a gift 
from their god, one that it bestows to its servants. 

During  the  day,  two  of  Turner’s  gang  (August  and  Ja-
cob), lie in their caskets. The other caskets are unoccupied 
but do contain a few items: 

G Trinkets belonging to the members of Turner’s gang, 
dating back to the days of the Civil War: lockets with 
the pictures of loved ones, long since dead; rings or 
other jewelry of the same period.  

G   One  of  Gla'aki’s  spines.  It  is  a  glistening,  metallic, 
sharp spine that appears to have been snapped off at 
one end. A hollow tubular channel runs throughout 
the center of its length. All relevant Science rolls are 
unable to identify the metal. It is not a metal of Earth-
ly  origin  (Sanity  roll,  0/1  SAN  loss  for  those  who 
make their Science (Chemistry or Biology) roll).
G   A  diary,  with  the  name  of  Joseph  Turner  inscribed 
inside the front cover, which details his backstory(see 
page 361). Most of it is in fairly untidy handwriting 
and will take some time to be read. However, flicking 
through the book, the investigators can get a general 
idea of the events from occasional readable lines.

357 

chapter 15: scenariosroll, whichever is lowest. If successful, the lid can be opened 
from the inside or outside. If this roll is pushed, a suggested 
consequence of failure is that the character passes out or has 
a Dream-vision sent from Gla'aki. 

Given  that  they  won’t  leave  Turner’s  cabin  during  the 
day, August and Jacob won’t pursue the investigators beyond 
the threshold should they flee the cabin. They will wait for 
the cover of darkness to begin any pursuit. 

Day 3: The Lake
Following the older trail further still, it comes to the edge of 
the  black  and  stagnant  lake  that  the  investigators  have  seen 
in  their  dreams.  Here,  the  five  surviving  artists  have  been 
strapped to poles about five meters in from the shore of the 
lake. In the evening of Day 2 they were bought here and offered 
to Gla'aki, who rose from the lake and pierced each one in the 
chest with a two-foot, metallic spine; blood and viscera cover 
the unfortunate painters. Call for Sanity rolls, with 1/1D6 SAN 
loss. Each artist should be dead, however if the investigators get 
close enough they realize that they are still moving—triggering 
another Sanity roll, with 1/1D4 SAN loss. 

Despite their minds being broken by their experiences, 
the  artists  will  relay  their  story  if  the  investigators  untie 
them. Read aloud or paraphrase the following:

“They took us in the night from our camp… Walking 
corpses… They took us to the dig site where the others 
are being held. There’s a boy and a man, and a girl. 
One of us got away… The dead are trying to lift some-
thing out of a pit. They are using tools and dynamite. 
Something terrible is in the water. It’s in us, spreading 
like a sickness. I can feel it burning away my soul. KILL 
US! REMOVE THE SPINES! PLEASE!” 

Removing the spines from their chests frees them from 
their  pain  and  they  each  die  with  a  scream  that  may  well 

attract attention. Call for a group Luck roll. Failure means 
that James Stanton and Dean Walters come from the nearby 
dig site to investigate. 

If the investigators stay to watch what happens then they 
need to make Stealth rolls to avoid detection. The undead 
servants  will  attempt  to  overpower  the  investigators  and 
drag them to the hut (see Capturing the Investigators) if 
they spot them. If the investigators removed spines from any 
of the captives, the servants will carelessly discard the corps-
es  and  tie  any  captured  investigators  to  the  vacant  poles. 
Escaping  these  bonds  requires  an  Hard  STR  or  DEX  roll. 
If the roll is failed, the player may push the roll. Remember 
the player must justify the pushed roll. One consequence of 
failure might be that the investigator rocks the pole so much 
that it falls over, landing the investigator face down in the 
water.  Alternatively  they  pass  out  and  awaken  at  night  as 
Gla'aki appears.

If they are still bound there when night falls, Turner and 
his gang come to the lake to call forth Gla'aki and offer up 
the  investigators  as  undying  servants.  If  any  of  the  artists 
were not liberated by the investigators they will rise as un-
dead servants at midnight. 

Day 3: The Dig Site
How this scene unfolds is dependent on the actions of the 
investigators;  whether  they  march  blindly  into  the  dig  site 
or  take  a  more  cautious  approach  (see  A  More  Cautious  
Approach, see page 361). 

Attempting to gain open and direct entry

Walking  down  the  road,  the  investigators  will  hear  the 
sound  of  activity  up  ahead.  Rounding  a  corner,  they  find 
one of the undead servants from the survey team, Richard 
Gibson, standing beside a five bar-gate that blocks the road. 
The  road  bends  farther  around  out  of  sight,  however  the 
investigators are able to make out a few huts and a clearing  
from which comes the sound of machinery. 

"KILL US! REMOVE THE SPINES! PLEASE!"

358 

Call of CthulhuIf the investigators are not hostile, Richard will be sur-
prisingly civil and welcoming, although will not allow them 
access  into  the  site.  Remember  that  while  Richard  is  an 
undead servant he can still pass for human—he’s still pretty 
fresh. He will explain that this is a work site where they are 
conducting blasting and not safe for members of the public. 
The  investigators  may  attempt  Fast  Talk,  Persuade, 
Charm,  or  Intimidate  rolls.  Failure  means  that  they  are 
turned away. If they push the roll and fail, time is wasted, 
and other undead servants arrive, leading to a possible con-
frontation.  Success  means  Richard  will  take  them  to  Carl 
White, the site foreman.

Inside the Dig Site
The dig site comprises five temporary huts around the edge 
of a clearing. In the center of the clearing  is a blast crater 
leading to the hole that contains the crystal.

James  Stanton,  Dean  Walters,  and  Carl  White  make 
their way back and forth from the hole to the furthest hut 
(the storage hut), where they are taking ropes and tools to 
attach to the crystal to pull it to the surface. At night they are 
assisted by Turner and his gang.

The first hut is the foreman’s office. There are geological 
survey maps of the woods on display, with numerous places 
marked  (suspected  sites  of  mineral  deposits),  as  well  as 
basic laboratory equipment. Should the investigators get the 
chance to look through the paperwork in here, they will dis-
cover that certain mineral deposits have been found which 
defy  analysis  and  that  the  team  have  been  sent  to  recover 
all deposits in the water drainage basin to prevent possible 
contamination of the reservoir. 

The  second  of  the  five  huts  provides  sleeping  quarters 
for  the  team,  containing  what  minimal  possessions  they 
have brought with them. 

The third hut is a kitchen and mess hall (not used of late). 
The fourth hut has the windows boarded up and is sim-
ply marked as "storage." This hut is used to hold prisoners.
The fifth hut, at the far end, is marked as a "tool shed," con-
taining drilling equipment and other tools, such as dynamite. 

Carl’s Explanation and Entrapment
If the investigators gain access, they may be introduced to 
Carl White, who is pleasant enough to the investigators at 
first and suggests that they step into his office. Given that he 
and his team have only recently been converted to Gla'aki’s 

The Dig Site

359 

chapter 15: scenarioscause,  they  don’t  suffer  the  harmful  effects  of  exposure  to 
sunlight,  but  it’s  still  a  hot  summer  day  out  there  all  the 
same, so shade is preferable for a long conversation. 

Carl is willing to give the investigators a sanitized version 
of what the team is doing. He explains (honestly) that they 
have been sent into the woods to conduct geological surveys. 
He doesn’t say that they are looking for mineral deposits that 
could contaminate the reservoir’s water supply. He explains 
that they have found evidence of a potential deposit of plati-
num at this site—hence the deep blasting. They haven’t found 
any yet, but they are hopeful that they will soon. 

If the posse are not satisfied by his answers, Carl will of-
fer to show them around the rest of the site, but will avoid 
showing them inside the hole and the crystal monolith they 
are trying to blast free. This is all a ruse, designed to lead the 
investigators into a trap.

Capturing the Investigators
Carl will eventually lead the investigators to the fourth hut, and 
the other servants begin to casually make their way over to as-
sist him in the capture. Carl invites the investigators in to show 
them some of the mineral samples that have been uncovered. 

The interior is dark, but with the front door open there 
is enough light to see inside. Carl takes the investigators to 
a side room where the bound prisoners (Jane Strong, Brian 
and  Arthur  Hall)  are  being  kept.  Meanwhile,  the  servants 
shut the door to blot out the light (as they can see perfectly 
well in the dark) and rush the investigators, attempting to 
restrain and capture them. 

Turner,  Vincent,  and  Louis  (if  he  was  not  dispatched 
earlier) are in the adjoining room, sheltering from the sun, 
and will come to assist at the sound of conflict. Turner may 
use the Dominate spell (see page 254) to ensure the investi-
gators are bound without issue. 

In any case, the gloves are off at this point and the ser-
vants can’t allow the investigators to leave. If overcome, the 
investigators will be locked in the dark hut until nightfall, 
when they will be taken down to the water to become slaves 
to Turner’s god. 

The Other Prisoners and their Guards

If captured, the investigators might talk to the other prisoners:
Jane:  She  was  taken  from  the  hideout  in  the  dead  of 
night where she had been kept hostage by the Harris gang. 
Then "dead men" walked in and killed her captor by impal-
ing him on the side of the tree. 

Brian and Arthur: They were on their way back out of 
the  woods  when  they  met  the  artists  and  decided  to  stay 
for the night. They saw the paintings and realized that they 
were all having the same dreams. Brian is badly shaken up 
and confused; he overheard his captives talking. One said he 
would, "Become one with their new god." They took the art-
ists away and they have not returned. Arthur, the boy, simply 
rocks back and forth, crying.

The  servants  will  be  keeping  guard  and  can  make  an 
appearance as the Keeper wishes. They don’t want to harm 
their captives before nightfall if they can help it. 

The Crystal

Escape
If  the  investigators  have  been  taken  captive,  the  bonds 
holding them will be secure; it could take a while to work 
themselves free. The investigators can make Hard DEX rolls, 
whether  they  try  to  free  their  own  bonds  or  help  another 
investigator. This roll may be pushed, with the consequence 
of failure being attracting the servants’ attention.

Any  servants  in  the  next  room  can  hear  everything  the 
investigators say if louder than a whisper. They will intervene 
if they hear anything suspicious. A successful Stealth roll will 
allow investigators (once free of their bonds) to move across 
the  room  to  the  door  without  being  heard.  The  door  leads 
to the main room of the hut where the servants stand guard.
Ultimately,  how  it  plays  out  from  here  is  down  to  the 
Keeper. Some points to bear in mind are what the time was 
when  the  investigators  entered  the  hut  and  how  long  they 
have till sundown—given the time needed to break free. Then 
there is the matter of Turner and his gang in the next room. If 
the prisoners are found to have broken free, they won’t have 
any hesitation using force to subdue them. If they break free 
into  the  daylight,  it’s  down  to  Carl  and  the  survey  team  to 
stop them, as Turner and his men won’t pursue in daylight. 
Escaping from the site will result in a hunt to the death, as 
the  undead  servants  can’t  run  the  risk  of  the  investigators 
escaping when they are so close to completing their goal.

If the investigators don’t manage to break free they are 
taken down to the lake when night falls to be converted to 
undying servants; see The Lake (see page 358). 

360 

Call of CthulhuA More Cautious Approach
Wise  investigators  may  watch  the  site  for  a  while  and  get  a 
better idea of what is going on. Over the course of the remain-
ing day, they will see the undead servants (all except Turner 
and his men—they wait till dark in the hut) walking purpose-
fully around the site, carrying tools and ropes to the pit. From 
within  the  pit  they  can  hear  the  sound  of  working  and,  by 
sunset, the servants will have built an elaborate pulley system 
above the pit that snakes from the site to edge of the nearby 
lake. Soon after, as night falls, the workers, assisted by Turner 
and his crew, begin to operate the pulley, using the truck to 
pull out a pale blue-colored crystal. It almost seems as if there 
is a source of light shining deep within the crystal. 

If the investigators don’t intervene, the workers will drag 
the crystal to the lake and call forth Gla'aki, who rises from 
the waters, grasps the crystal and begins to drain the power 
from it. The crystal shines with a bright blue light (as seen 
the previous night, after the explosion) that becomes pain-
ful to watch after a few seconds. With a flash, the light finally 
dies and Gla'aki thrashes in the water. With a bellowing roar, 
it sinks slowly beneath the waves and the undead servants 
return to the dig site, full of pleasure for having fulfilled the 
dreams  of  their  god.  Investigators  witnessing  this  should 
make appropriate Sanity rolls for seeing Gla'aki.

They will collect their prisoners and head to the lake to 
convert them before they join their god in the depths of the 
black waters. 

The  investigators  could  wait  until  nightfall  (although 
most  likely  being  unaware  of  the  fact  that  darkness  does 
not impede the undead servants) and the distraction of the 
undead workers with the crystal, to free the prisoners. 

Likewise, there are plenty of tools, including dynamite, 
lying about the site. If the investigators can destroy the pul-
ley and/or smash the crystal (it can be reduced to smaller 
pieces, but never destroyed) then they will also prevent or 
delay  Gla'aki’s  attempts  to  retrieve  it  and  drain  the  power 
from it. Killing the undead workers would also undermine 
Gla'aki’s ability to act.

Should  the  investigators  leave  and  go  for  help,  upon 
their  return,  they  find  the  whole  site  blown  apart  by  the 
remainder of the dynamite. The huts are burnt  down, the 
lake is still, and only a pattern of shambling footsteps in the 
mud (going below the water level) remain.

Conclusions
If  its  undead  servants  were  successful,  Gla'aki  has  taken  one 
small step towards freedom. Many crystal shards are left around 
the world for it to drain before it can finally be free again. It’s a 
long road, but one that has been made a little shorter.

If  the  investigators  were  aware  that  the  prisoners  were 
being  held  on  the  site  but  were  unable  to  save  them,  they 
each suffer 1/1D6 Sanity loss. 

If  Jane  Strong  is  rescued  and  Gla'aki  thwarted,  each 
investigator that fulfills his or her motivation (if motivation 
handouts were given out at the start of the game) receives a 
1D6 SAN reward.

If  the  prisoners  were  saved,  the  investigators  gain  1D6 
Sanity  points,  in  addition  to  the  reward  money.  They  are 
local celebrities and receive glowing write-ups in the Ben-
nington Banner.

A Note on Lethality
This scenario, and in particular the final confrontation, 
is designed for a group of investigators new to Call of 
Cthulhu. As such, the lethality is relatively low. 

However,  for  those  Keepers  who  wish  to  up  the 
ante,  consider  giving  the  servants  of  Gla'aki  some 
Civil War period weaponry. Having deserted from the 
Union army, they may not have left unarmed. As the 
rifle in Turner’s cabin suggests, they might  well have 
some  other  guns  elsewhere  that  work.  As  such,  this 
can turn into a firefight between the servants and the 
investigators. 

Non-Player Characters 
Where groups of non-player characters are listed, the same 
values may be used for each of them, however the Keeper 
may vary the statistics as they wish.

Joseph Turner and his gang, Undead Servants

Turner and his gang arrived here in 1865, avoiding conscrip-
tion into the Union army. They were converted to servants 
of  Gla'aki  and  have  been  here  ever  since.  They  are  more 
monster than human now. 

The  Turner  gang  consists  of  Turner  plus  four  others; 
August, Jacob, Vincent and Louis. Use the entries given for 
servants  of  Gla'aki  in  Chapter  14:  Monsters,  Beasts  and 
Alien Gods.

The servants have weaknesses and can be destroyed. If 
exposed to sunlight, Turner and his gang should have one 
penalty  applied  to  all  their  actions  per  hour  of  exposure. 
Only spending time spent in the blue stone caskets can al-
leviate  the  spread  of  the  green  decay. After  three  hours  of 
constant sunlight their bodies disintegrate forever.

Turner  has  been  especially  blessed  by  Gla'aki  and  is  a 

little more powerful than the average Servant.

A Restless Night
Your sleep is far from restful. You toss and turn from 
side to side, bombarded throughout the hours of dark-
ness by images that you barely recall when you awake. 
Maybe it’s the previous day’s trek through the forest 
that’s influencing this. All you remember are the dark 
trees  surrounding  you,  the  sickly,  yellowing  leaves 
falling  to  the  ground.  You  feel  a  terrible  foreboding. 
Something is out there. Watching. Waiting…

You  wake  feeling  exhausted.  It’s  as  if  you  didn’t 
sleep at all. You suffer one penalty die on any CON 
rolls throughout the next day until you sleep again.

A Path Through the 
Forest
The forest extends all around you. The path cuts and 
snakes its way between the trees, carpeted by freshly 
fallen  yellowed  leaves  that  have  begun  to  dry  and 
wither  as  if  a  sickness  infests  them.  You’re  walking 
slowly down the path in silence. Nothing moves but 
you. There is no wind. There is no sound. Everything 
is dead. You feel something calling you from further 
down the path, just out of sight. There’s a clearing up 
ahead; yellow light reflects off something… Could it 
be water? There’s a snap of a twig behind you and as 
you turn to look, a sharp pain sinks into your chest as 
something plunges into you.

You wake with a gasp and a splutter. 

A Cabin in Darkness
Yellow  leaves  fall  slowly  from  the  thick  roof  of 
branches above. Blades of sunlight stab through the 
darkness. Ahead of you stands a dilapidated log cabin. 
The  door  swings  slowly  open  and  figures  emerge. 
They advance slowly with purpose. You want to turn 
and run, but you can’t take your eyes from them. Your 
muscles strain as your brain cries out for your limbs to 
work—you are powerless!

The figures wear strange clothes… You hear the first 
one, a man’s voice, as he comes closer. “Come with us. 
Join  us  in  His  service.  Embrace  your  new  destiny  and 
bask in his eternal glory.” Its face is lifeless, pale and un-
blinking. A dark green smear of corruption spreads down 
from an empty eye socket. It grins and its skin cracks. 

You wake in terror. 
[Make a Sanity roll for 1/1D6 SAN loss]

The Thing in the Lake

You stand on the shore of a stagnant lake. Black, stink-
ing water lies before you, while the pale moon above 
reflects  off  of  its  oily  surface.  An  unhealthy  yellow 
glow shines through the wooded tree line surround-
ing the lake. You can feel their presence behind you, 
blocking your retreat. You’ve stood there for hours and 
now you know the time is finally at hand. Strange light 
pulses  from  beneath  the  water.  Tendrils  rise  slowly 
from  the  surface,  writhing  and  twisting  in  the  cold 
night air. At their ends, lids open and blink, revealing 
inhuman  eyes  that  look  into  your  soul.  An  array  of 
metallic spikes begins to thrust upwards as something 
huge rises to greet the night. Like polished metal, it 
glistens in the moonlight. The spines writhe and flex. 
You  feel  a  sickening  stab  as  something  plunges  into 
your chest…

 You wake screaming.

chapter 15: scenariosCrimson  
Letters

Introduction

his is an open-ended scenario set in the envi-
rons of Arkham. The adventure begins focused 
on events transpiring at the ill-starred Miska-
tonic University and involves the pursuit of a 
set of valuable and dangerous missing papers 
following an unexplained death. The scenario is at its heart 
a murder mystery, but one where the true culprit is not of 
this earth and the facts of the case are shrouded by strange 
events,  greed  and  obsession.  The  scenario  takes  place  in 
October, some time in the 1920s, during the Prohibition era. 
While  this  could  be  used  as  an  introduction  to  the 
Mythos  for  the  investigators,  it  is  perhaps  better  suited  as 
part  of  the  opening  stages  of  a  larger  campaign,  after  the 
investigators have come together as a group and begun to 
earn a reputation in certain circles. It also has enough open-
ings and opportunities for Keepers to add plot threads, en-
counters, and factions of their own to exploit later, as well as 
provide the investigators with potential friends and contacts 
(should they succeed) to aid them in the future.

The  events  of  this  scenario  are  triggered  by  the  unex-
pected  death  of  Professor  Charles  Leiter,  an  academic  at 
Miskatonic  University,  in  strange  circumstances  that  have 
the  possibility  of  opening  up  the  University  to  charges  of 
misappropriation and theft, and a potential scandal it can 
ill-afford. One of the administrators at the university, Dean 
Bryce Fallon, will engage the investigators with the task of 
looking into the untimely demise of Charles Leiter, and in 
particular  the  recovery  of  certain  valuable  papers  which 
were in Leiter’s care and are now missing, preferably before 
their legal owners become aware of the loss. 

The scenario is intended for two to five investigators. It 
will prove helpful if at least one of the investigators has an 
antiquarian  or  academic  background,  although  this  is  not 
vital. Good social skills will also be of help, as will a willing-
ness to engage with the non-player characters.

This  scenario  is  non-linear  and  requires  some  deci-
sions and preparation by the Keeper before play. While this 
scenario can be played in one session if condensed, it may 
prove more rewarding if played over several sessions.

Keeper’s Information
Charles Leiter, a young up-and-coming professor at Miska-
tonic  University,  was  not  all  that  he  appeared. A  specialist 
in  colonial  history,  as  well  as  something  of  a  socialite  and 
charmer,  unbeknownst  to  his  fellows  in  the  stolid  halls  of 
the university he was also living a double life as a profligate 
and a gambler—a life he was funding through forgery and 
theft. Artifacts of America’s colonial past and revolutionary 
era hold considerable value to private collectors and Leiter 
has spent the last few years using his access to the university’s 
collection, and the private collections of those his academic 
credentials have allowed him to borrow from, to supply him 
with the means to support his vice. Generally he has been 
clever while doing this, forging letters and documents and, 
where he can, selling them on as the genuine article (while 
insisting to his secret clientele that he has swapped a fake for 
the original.) However, for all Leiter’s craft and guile, he did 
not bargain that there are certain dangers in old and forgot-
ten books and papers—dangers that can transcend time and 
doom those that seek such knowledge. 

Around  four  months  ago,  Leiter  was  called  in  to  help 
the Miskatonic University in the assessment of the papers of 
the late Joshua Hobbhouse by his estate. Hobbhouse was a 
recluse who died an octogenarian bachelor and had lived in 
a rambling colonial house on the outskirts of the town, the 
last direct descendant of a line going back to the founding 
of the town centuries before. His house has proved to be a 
treasure trove of diaries, historical documents, pictures, and 
artifacts that span the history of New England. 

Inventoried first by the legal firm assigned by the Cobb 
family (a well-to-do Providence clan who are distant rela-
tives by marriage and the fortunate inheritors of Hobbhouse 
estate), the papers were passed onto the Miskatonic for more 
professional assessment of their worth and significance, with 
the understanding that this trust may be repaid ultimately 
with the eventual investiture of a collection or the donation 
of certain papers. This has represented quite a coup as the 
promised  prestige  it  would  bring  is  of  significant  value  to 
the university. 

Leiter lobbied heavily for the assessment of the papers to 
come to him. Not surprisingly, he had pressing ulterior mo-

364 

Call of Cthulhutives for securing the work, as his money was running out 
and some less than pleasant creditors had been threatening 
to  take  matters  of  repayment  into  their  own  hands.  The 
papers quickly proved a godsend in this regard—or so he 
thought—for among them he discovered a bound sheaf of 
previously unknown correspondence and evidentiary ma-
terials from the Arkham Witch Trials of the 1690s—worth 
a small fortune to the right buyer. Leiter believed the dusty 
old documents dealt with nothing more than an outland-
ish period of hysteria and superstition in New England’s 
history; however he couldn’t have been more wrong and 
was to pay for his mistake with his life. 

As soon as he could lay his hands on the Witch Trial 
Papers, Leiter put the word out to potential secret buyers 
and  with  the  help  of  his  long-time  accomplice—a  failed 
ex-student and fine artist named Cecil Hunter—set about 
trying  to  forge  the  more  complex  portion  of  the  papers. 
This proved to be the start of his problems as the recep-
tion  to  his  offer  among  his  contacts  was  almost  univer-
sally  poor,  except  for  solicitations  from  would-be  clients 
he hadn’t bargained for and whose reputations frightened 
him. Leiter found himself at the center of a bidding war 
between  several  clients.  His  home  was  broken  into  and 
ransacked,  and  he  became  convinced  that  he  was  being 
followed. Little did Leiter know, by the separation of the 
papers and the attempt to copy them, the forces slumber-
ing in the ink would be unleashed.

Subject to a sudden spate of horrific nightmares, and 
convinced  his  life  was  in  danger,  he  became  determined 
to  be  rid  of  the  problem  as  soon  as  possible.  Leiter  hit 
upon  the  plan  of  selling  duplicates  to  several  parties  at 
once,  and  so  assigned  Hunter  the  task  of  swiftly  forging 
several sets of complicated diagrams that formed part of 
the  papers—despite  Hunter’s  own  increasing  misgivings. 
Shortly afterwards, Cecil Hunter went mad and the rest of 
the papers went missing.

Leiter,  his  life  spiraling  out  of  control,  hounded  and 
pursued now by individuals he could no longer even hope 
to appease, made hurried arrangements to skip town with 
whatever  wealth  he  could  muster,  leaving  the  name  and 
career he had built behind him. On the evening of the 23rd 
September, Leiter returned to his faculty office in the Mis-
katonic University to retrieve what items of value he could. 
Leiter’s last act was a somewhat noble one. When possessed 
by  the  Horror,  rather  than  do  its  bidding  (and  knowing 
his end was nigh), he forced himself to look fixedly into a 
mirror; his soul was burnt out and he died behind his own 
locked  door  sometime  after  midnight.  His  body,  frozen 
in a paroxysm of terror, was discovered the next day. The 
cause of death has since been officially recorded as sudden 
heart  failure,  however  dark  rumors  already  circulate  on 
campus that that is far from the whole of the truth. 

A cursory investigation by the Faculty Head, Dean Fal-
lon, has uncovered disquieting evidence of the hidden life 
Leiter was leading (although Fallon has barely scratched the 
surface), and the absence of the Witch Trial Papers. A scandal 
and perhaps criminal (or at least civil) proceedings against 
the University by the papers’ owners is imminent if answers 

365 

Menaces, Hidden,  
and Otherwise
This scenario possesses several dangers for the inves-
tigators, both mortal and otherworldly. It is up to the 
Keeper, and in no small part the actions of the investi-
gators, just what dangers will be confronted and when. 
Keepers should not give players who "bull in a china 
shop" their way through the investigation an easy time 
of it—the less subtle and incautious the investigators 
are, the more danger they may place themselves in. 

The Mob: The most mundane of these are Leiter’s 
creditors, specifically a pair of gangster heavies sent to 
make good on Leiter’s debts any way they can. Until 
they see a body, they aren’t going to quit; after all this 
wouldn’t be the first person to have feigned death in 
order to run out on a debt.

The  Suspects:  Even  though  Charles  Leiter  didn’t 
know and wouldn’t have believed what he had in his 
hands, there exist those who may well have done and 
who have secrets of their own. Perhaps a student with 
an axe to grind or a dealer in stolen art and antiquities 
with the darkest of appetites—the Dramatis Personae 
section  offers  a  number  of  potential  individuals  who 
might not take kindly to the investigators asking ques-
tions  and  poking  around  in  their  affairs—regardless 
of whether they actually have the Witch Trial Papers 
themselves.  Such  individuals  may  be  easily  provoked 
into humiliating, blackmailing or attacking the investi-
gators if they feel threatened with exposure. 

Bound  in  Blood  and  Ink:  Caught  in  very  fabric 
of  the  Arkham  Witch  Trial  Papers,  something  other-
worldly  and  utterly  inimical  to  life  has  slumbered  for 
centuries—mere  moments  to  its  alien  perceptions. 
In  the  papers’  separation  and  the  forger’s  clumsy  at-
tempts to replicate the broken geometry of the image 
that  imprisoned  it,  the  creature’s  bindings  are  slowly 
unraveling and it is slowly sliding into the world, with 
increasing solidity and power. Those who have come 
into physical contact with the Papers are at risk as the 
Horror  hunts  them  down  and  possesses  them,  using 
them as vessels through which it causes mayhem and 
death.

The Ticking Bomb: Though the investigators will 
not at first be aware of it, a countdown is in operation 
and, if it is allowed to reach zero, there will be blood. 
Simply returning the papers is not enough and those 
who do not deal with the Horror bound within will be 
in for an unpleasant surprise later, as the monster kills 
the Dean and then anyone else who has touched the 
papers—including the investigators!

chapter 15: scenarioscannot be gathered quickly, however Fal-
lon himself cannot be seen to be involved. 
Thus the investigators are called upon, but 
they are far from the only ones interested 
in  these  particular  letters,  and  the  forces 
bound  within  the  papers  themselves  are 
getting restless. 

So where are the papers and who has 

them? That’s for the Keeper to decide. 

Scenario Format
The course of this scenario is determined 
by  the  investigator’s  actions  (and  there-
fore  the  player’s  decisions).  Facts  and 
clues  lie  around  the  affairs  of  the  dead 
man and those who knew him, and it’s up 
to the investigators which lines of enquiry 
to pursue. Importantly, no single clue or 
its discovery is vital to the scenario’s out-
come; it is instead rather the tapestry of 
what the investigators do and what they 
discover  that  will  lead  to  the  scenario’s 
conclusion  for  good  or  ill.  Beyond  this 
loose framework, there is—if the Keeper 
wishes to use it—the optional factor of a 
deadline involved, as something has been 
unleashed  from  the  Witch  Trial  Papers; 
the  same  thing  that  killed  Leiter  in  his 
locked office at the Miskatonic Universi-
ty, a thing that now wishes to be free and, 
unless stopped, might cause considerable 
havoc  and  murder  in  its  passing.  See 
Manifestations  of  Horror  on  page  379 
for more details on this.

Most  of  the  key  facts  and  secrets 
of  this  mystery  are  to  be  found  not  in 
locked  drawers  or  hidden  rooms,  but 
in  the  minds  and  desires  of  the  people 
surrounding the death of Charles Leiter. 
Rather  than  a  list  of  locations  and  en-
counters, the "meat" of this adventure is 
a  detailed  dramatis  personae—a  cast  of 
characters,  whose  secrets  and  motiva-
tions the Keeper should become familiar 
with, and most importantly, decide who 
is the culprit.

Investigators  will  need  to  extract 
information from the various non-player 
characters  (NPCs)  and  so  will  need  to 
employ communication skills (Fast Talk, 
Persuade,  Charm,  Intimidate,  as  well  as 
Psychology).  Keepers  are  recommended 
to  revisit  both  the  various  skill  descrip-
tions  and  the  section  on  Charm,  Fast 
Talk,  Intimidate,  and  Persuade  skills: 
Difficulty Levels (see page 93). Wherever 
possible, try to encourage the players to

portable of value. The Horror manifests and attacks him behind closed 
doors and he is horrifically slain.
September  24th:  Leiter’s  body  is  found  by  one  of  his  grad-students, 
Emilia Court. Suspicious circumstances quickly come to light, however 
the police are fobbed-off by Dean Fallon. The Arkham Witch Trial Papers 
are discovered to be missing. A death certificate for "massive and sudden 
heart failure" is written out by Doctor John Wheatcroft, a physician at the 
Miskatonic’s Medical School, who takes charge of Leiter’s corpse.    
October 1st: With increasingly terse enquiries being made by the Cobb 
family, strange sorts making inquiries about the dead man, and rumors 
of  foul  play  abroad  on  campus,  Dean  Fallon  seeks  outside  help.  The 
investigators are called in—the scenario begins.
Future  Events:  October  (various  dates  as  the  Keeper  desires)–in  an 
increasingly violent series of manifestations, the Horror begins to hunt 
down  anybody  who  has  had  close  contact  with  the  papers,  the  fre-
quency of the manifestations increasing rapidly.

Call of Cthulhuroleplay through their conversations with the different char-
acters, as this will be far more fun than simply rolling dice.

Each  of  the  main  NPCs  has  been  given  roleplaying 
hooks. The hooks provide you with possible ways to engage 
the NPC with the investigators and to complicate the inves-
tigator’s lives.

Finally, the information presented is intended first and 
foremost as a skeleton for the Keeper to flesh out as desired, 
adding more detail as he or she wishes—all to make the best 
use of the scenario for their own game and to suit their own 
tastes and that of the players. 

Expansion Sources
Keepers  may  find  the  Map  of  Arkham  (see  page 
428)  useful  in  determining  locations  of  the  various 
non-player characters who live outside of Miskatonic 
University.  In  addition,  the  Chaosium  publications 
H.P.  Lovecraft’s  Arkham,  and  Miskatonic  University 
would  be  useful  for  Keepers  wishing  to  add  further 
depth  to  the  adventure.  However,  neither  of  these 
Call of Cthulhu source books is essential for the run-
ning of this scenario.

Dramatis Personae
The  following  is  a  list  of  the  principal  characters  the  in-
vestigators  may  encounter,  along  with  descriptions,  their 
relationship to Leiter, and their role in the scenario. Game 
statistics for each can be found in the Appendix at the end 
of the scenario.

Each of the potential culprits is initially described as an 
innocent party (with regard to the Arkham Witch Trial Pa-
pers), followed by an entry explaining their role if chosen as 
the culprit. Once the Keeper has chosen a culprit, it may be 
necessary to rework the rest of the entry for that individual, 
making alterations to the character as required.

Bryce Fallon, Dean of Administration 
at the Miskatonic University
One of the senior administrative officers of the University, 
Fallon is a charming, immaculately turned-out man in his 
early  fifties  to  whom  middle  age  has  been  kind,  and  who 
exudes  the  kind  of  even  temperament  and  calm  authority 

much sought after in the 
likes  of  clergymen  and 
country doctors. He has 
a  pleasant  manner  and 
certain 
thoughtfulness 
of  speech  that  success-
fully hides the full extent 
of  both  his  intelligence 
and  ambition.  An  able 
administrator with a tal-
ent  for  recalling  names 
and  faces,  his  calling 
has  always  been  within 
the  University’s  man-
than 
rather 
agement 
pure  academia 
(with 
mathematics  being  his 
somewhat 
indifferent 
former  specialty).  His  interest  in  the  missing  papers  is 
purely political—the preservation of the reputation of the 
Miskatonic  University  is  his  primary  goal.  Short  of  direct 
implication in murder and bloodletting, he will quite happi-
ly go along with (or at the very least turn a blind eye to) just 
about  anything  that  will  see  the  matter  of  the  Witch  Trial 
Papers "dealt with satisfactorily."

Bryce Fallon

Relationship  to  Leiter:  Fallon  knew  Leiter  profession-
ally but not personally outside of work. He knew him to be 
competent and ambitious, and more than a little bit oily. He 
will  greet  any  revelations  about  Leiter’s  personal  life  with 
distain but not surprise, and is keen for Leiter’s career at the 
MU to be quietly forgotten.

Facts and Clues

T  Fallon will apprise the investigators of the mysteri-
ous  death  (he  has  no  idea  of  the  cause  other  than 
"violent seizure.")

T  Fallon has no knowledge of the true danger or value 
of  the  papers,  nor  of  Leiter’s  connection  to  Cecil 
Hunter.  If  asked,  he  can  confirm  Hunter’s  prior 
career as an art student at MU and his dismissal for 
moral turpitude.

T  Fallon  can  provide  the  investigators  with  keys  to 
Leiter’s office and home, as well as contact with any 
relevant members of the Faculty. 

T  He  will  discuss  the  involvement  of  both  Harland 

Roach and Emilia Court. 

T  While he knows a little about Leiter’s gambling, he 
knows nothing about Leiter’s forgery business. 

Roleplaying hooks

T  Fallon is increasingly  anxious to secure  the  papers 
before  trouble  escalates  further  between  the  Cobb 
family  and  the  university  (this  may  happen  when 
one of the Cobb family dies).

367 

chapter 15: scenariosT  He  insists  on  being  systematic;  evidence  must  be 
catalogued, evaluated, and retained (including Leit-
er’s corpse) until the matter is closed.

T  Later, failing the return of the papers, Fallon will seek 
to shift the blame to another NPC (or even the inves-
tigators), desperate to preserve his own reputation.

Keeper’s  Notes:  Fallon  is  far  from  any  stereotype  of  a 
bumbling academic, despite what others may assume, nor is 
he naïve. He spent a short stint in the army in his youth and 
has for many years dealt with "unfortunate" matters for the 
Miskatonic  University  with  tact  and  discretion—ranging 
from  student  suicides  to  the  mundane  and  occasionally 
less  than  mundane  failings  of  faculty  members.  Although 
he has no great personal knowledge of the Mythos or those 
that  have  truck  with  it,  he  is  quietly  informed  by  his  own 
experiences that sometimes things far from the normal run 
of existence gather around Arkham and its university.

Fallon will want regular private updates on how matters 
are progressing from the investigators. The Dean can act as a 
conduit for information from the Keeper as needed.

If the Witch Trial Papers are handed to him early in the 
scenario by particularly adroit investigators, the Horror will 
be  drawn  to  him,  although  its  first  manifestation  will  be 
merely terrifying rather than fatal. He will appeal immedi-
ately to the investigators to help him if they can, although 
whether they can save him is another matter!

Beyond this scenario: Depending on the investigators’ 
personal  dealings  with  Fallon,  should  he  survive,  he  can 
make  for  a  useful  contact  in  the  future  and  a  potential 
source of both information and employment.

Doctor John Wheatcroft, Physician, 
Tutor and Sometime Coroner
Wheatcroft  is  an  elderly,  watery-eyed,  and  walrus-mus-
tached  man  somewhere  the  wrong  side  of  sixty,  with  too 
much skin  and not enough flesh, having lost considerable 
weight  since  having  a 
mild heart attack some 
ten years ago. Formerly 
an assistant coroner in 
Boston,  Wheatcroft 
retired  to  a  part-time 
teaching position at the 
Miskatonic  University 
where  he  had  attained 
his  medical  degree  in 
his youth. He is a dull, 
prosaic  and  unimag-
inative  man,  who  is 
nevertheless  a  diligent 
and 
knowledgeable 
medical examiner. 

Dr. John Wheatcroft

He is loyal to Fallon 
and  the  Faculty,  and 
given the state of Leit-
er’s  remains,  he  was 

more than ready to issue a death certificate for "massive and 
sudden heart failure," rather than expose the strangeness of 
the  death  and  any  scandal  that  might  ensue. Although,  as 
conventional a soul as he is, this mild cover-up is weighing 
heavily on his conscience.  

Facts and Clues

T  Wheatcroft both pronounced Leiter dead and took 
charge of the body (which is still in his possession 
in the Medical School facilities) and has performed 
a  private  autopsy  at  the  behest  of  Dean  Fallon.  If 
one  of  the  investigators  convinces  Wheatcroft  of 
their own medical training, have Wheatcroft involve 
the  investigator  in  the  autopsy  rather  than  having 
conducted it already.

T  Wheatcroft knew Leiter while alive only as a face passed 
occasionally in a corridor or glimpsed at a university 
ceremony—a fact he is now heartily glad of.

Roleplaying hooks

T  The doctor is anxious to get a promise from the inves-
tigators that they will not tell anyone about the true 
state of Leiter’s corpse, let alone show it to anyone!
T  He wants to be rid of the body as soon as possible 
(as its presence is distressing him); surely the inves-
tigators can help.

T  He  denies  any  belief  in  the  supernatural  (while 
constantly looking over his shoulder). He seeks reas-
surance and company.

Keeper’s Notes: Wheatcroft  will  be  reluctant  to  talk  at 
first, mainly out of guilt for his part in the cover up; how-
ever, if the investigators impress him with tact and compe-
tency (displaying medical or police procedural knowledge, 
for example), he will become more helpful and be glad to 
transfer responsibility in this matter to them.

Emilia Court, Postgraduate Student
An  intense  and  studious  young  woman,  whose  dress  and 
restrained manner downplay her good looks. Emilia Court 
is a postgraduate student who was tasked to assist Leiter in 
the cataloguing and research on the Hobbhouse papers. She 
had a cool dislike of Leiter but loved the work and applied 
herself to it with something approaching fervor. For Leiter’s 
part,  once  he  realized  she  was  immune  to  his  charms,  he 
realized  her  value  professionally  and  was  content  to  treat 
her with all the attention and care he might accord a useful 
adding machine—being careful to conceal any impropriety 
from her, though not entirely successfully. 

Facts and Clues

T  Court found Leiter’s body after she called a custo-
dian with a passkey when she couldn’t get in to do 
her assigned work. The memory is a harrowing one 
for her. Leiter was inside the locked office: dead on 
the floor behind his desk, papers and money strewn 
about him.

Call of CthulhuThe Body in Question
The body of Professor Charles Leiter lies in the bowels 
of the Miskatonic University Medical School in locked 
cold storage, and will remain so until Dean Fallon has 
it  quietly  and  decently  cremated.  The  already-issued 
death  certificate  states  "massive  and  sudden  heart 
failure," which is no lie, but doesn’t exactly cover the 
whole of the truth. 

Leiter’s face is a screaming visage of horror, frozen 
in agony and terror at the moment of death. His eyes 
are  swollen,  whitish-grey  masses  of  colorless,  clot-
ted,  tissue.  Viewing  the  body  requires  a  Sanity  roll 
(0/1D4). Simply being around the body (even covered 
up)  has  an  unaccountably  unnerving  effect,  putting 
anybody nearby on edge and giving them the feeling 
of being watched. Ask for Listen rolls to hear a seem-
ing presence in the adjoining (empty) room (a Sign of 
Passage); such events are affecting the Doctor’s sanity.
The  Horror  may  manifest  through  Leiter’s  corpse 
(see  Signs  of  Passage),  raising  it  up  as  a  zombie  to 
cause  mayhem.  This  should  not  happen  during  the 
investigators’  first  visit,  but  could  happen  later  if  the 
investigators return with the mobsters or Lucy Stone. 
Alternatively the investigators may get a call when the 
thing breaks out of the school in the dead of night.

Autopsy  Results:  The  basic  results  as  found  by 
Wheatcroft are that Leiter suffered a massive heart at-
tack causing almost instantaneous death. In addition, 
the  body  suffered  violent  muscular  spasms  and,  by 
some  means,  severe  thermal  damage  of  the  optic  tis-
sues, akin to the effects of boiling the vitreous matter, 
cause  unknown.  Simultaneous  organ  failure  occurred 
all over the body and even his gut flora are dead, which 
is slowing the rate of decomposition. None of this is 
in any way normal or explicable by any outside cause.

T  Court serves witness to the legitimate side of Leiter’s 
double life, his relationship with the faculty, and the 
prestige of the Hobbhouse documents.

T  She knows of the rivalry and disagreements between 

Leiter and Roach.

T  She  knows  that  Anthony  Flinders  was  an  unwel-
come visitor, who begrudged her position as Leiter’s 
assistant.

T  She  can  also  testify  to  Leiter’s  increasingly  erratic 
behavior in early September, which bordered on the 
paranoid. 

Professor Leiter's Corpse
T  Attempts to bring Court round to assist the investi-
gators may best be attempted with intelligence and 
wit. She is strongly disinclined and resistant to glib 
flattery,  manifested  in  her  skills  through  her  high 
Psychology score (55%), thus investigators will find 
the difficulty level for Charm rolls begins at Hard. 
She may reveal that she saw a receipt for a change 
of  locks  at  Leiter’s  apartment  (see  the  Timeline) 
on his desk. She has known for some time, through 
overheard  telephone  conversations,  that  Leiter  has 
a close woman friend who boards at an apartment 
near  Hibb’s  Roadhouse  in Arkham,  where—Court 
guesses—she  waitresses  and  whose  first  name  is 
Lucy, but knows no more than this.

Roleplaying hooks
T  Court is keen to prove her worth in the eyes of the 

investigators; how can she help?

T  She is seeking to discredit Flinders and Roach, and 

will likely place the blame on them.

Keeper’s  Notes:  There’s  more  than  meets  the  eye  to 
Emilia Court. She is actually independently wealthy from old 
Providence stock, a fact she has kept hidden from everybody 
around her, preferring to make her way by merit and force of 
will into a field disinclined to her for both her relative youth 
and gender; her ultimate goal being awarded a professorship. 
These facts can be found out by some diligent digging around 
if  the  investigators  grow  suspicious  of  Court.  Regarded  as 
something of a cold fish by her peers, she is fiercely intelligent 
and regards the theft of the  Witch Trial Papers as a travesty 
that must be rectified. Court is also a good option for a player 

369 

chapter 15: scenariosto take over should an in-
vestigator  fatality  be  suf-
fered during the scenario! 
(As  long  as  she’s  not  the 
culprit of course.)

If chosen as the Cul-
prit: Court makes for an 
interesting  if  outwardly 
unlikely  suspect.  If  the 
Keeper  chooses  her  for 
the  culprit  she  hides  a 
far darker heart than any 
around  her  guess.  Per-
haps she plotted the theft 
of the Witch Trial Papers 
to  safeguard  them  after 
her  independent  discov-
ery  of  Leiter’s  forgery 
ring, or perhaps she knew the particular significance of the 
papers and their otherworldly nature and so plotted Leiter’s 
death to obtain them. If this is the case she will have stalked 
Cecil Hunter in his apartment, willfully condemning him to 
the horrors they contained, unleashing the nightmare from 
the  papers.  She  is,  as  stated,  from  old  Providence  money, 
and who is to say that the Courts are not close kin to the 
Curwens,  the  Marshes  or  even  that  once  their  name  was 
Mason. If you decide this is the case, you should rework her 
character as a witch, giving her a Cthulhu Mythos skill and 
spells. Alternatively perhaps a wizard (one of her ancestors) 
has used the Consume Likeness or Mind Exchange spell and 
stolen her identity so that he can get hold of the papers.

Emilia Court

Harland Roach, Rival Academic to the 
Dead Man
Roach is a paunchy, sweaty man with thick bottle-bottom 
spectacles  and  thinning,  oiled  hair  he  interferes  with 
whenever nervous or agitated, which is often. He looks per-
manently rumpled and disheveled in unkempt tweeds and 
shirts whose collars look wringing wet half the time—this 
coupled  with  a  ten-
dency to look at women 
and  children  as  if  they 
were  a  strange  form 
of 
inexplicable  pond 
life,  and  a  voice  with  a 
grating  nasal  whine—
offer  the  explanation 
as  to  why  despite  his 
superior  erudition  and 
an enviable list of pub-
lished  works,  he  lost 
out  to  Leiter  time  and 
again.

Harland Roach

through  Leiter’s  papers

after  his  death.  Roach  intended  to  use  the  opportunity  to 
steal the papers for himself, but instead uncovered the fact 
that the Witch Trial Papers are missing. 

Facts and Clues

T  Roach  has  made  a  survey  of  Leiter’s  papers  and 
went  to  Leiter’s  cottage  with  the  Dean  and  one  of 
the  university’s  handymen  to  gather  up  any  more 
papers.  While  there,  Roach  uncovered  first-hand 
evidence of past forgeries, as well as books and ma-
terials taken from the university without authority. 
Divided between thwarting Fallon and besmirching 
Leiter, Roach was unsure of what to do. He informed 
Fallon about Leiter’s gambling but kept evidence of 
forgeries to himself (hoping to profit from it some-
how later).

T  Roach knows the historical (and monetary) value of 
what is missing, but none of its true dangers. 
T  Roach has not seen the body and appears to believe 

the "heart attack" story without suspicion.
T  He is a firm non-believer in the supernatural.
T  Roach has already been through the papers at Leiter’s 
cottage near the campus once and has seen several 
things of note that he disregarded as irrelevant (see 
Leiter’s Cottage).

Roleplaying hooks

T  Roach  is  seeking  to  enhance  his  position  with  the 
university  and  may  consider  Fallon  a  potential 
barrier (after all, Fallon passed Roach over in favor 
of Leiter to handle the Hobbhouse papers). Roach 
will do whatever he can to discredit Fallon, perhaps 
seeking the investigators’ help to do so.

T  He will seek to besmirch Leiter’s name and reputa-

tion however possible.

370 

Call of CthulhuKeeper’s Notes: Roach is overeager to be of service to the 
University of which he is currently among its least favored 
faculty members, hoping finally for tenure as a reward for 
his part in this business. He is quietly terrified of Dean Fal-
lon, which keeps him in line, but is malign and ambitious in 
a small-hearted way and he can’t stop himself from gloating 
over Leiter’s death.

Roach is also insufferably curious about the matter now 
its scandalous dimensions have become known to him, and 
if he believes there lies some advantage to doing so, may try 
to tag along with the investigators or dog their tracks—pos-
sibly attempting to steal the papers (if he does not possess 
them) or blackmail the investigators (if he is able) in order 
to obtain the papers so that he can save the day himself.

If  chosen  as  the  culprit:  Roach  makes  for  a  logical 
suspect  in  the  papers’  theft—Leiter  repeatedly  usurped 
him and their rivalry was well known in the university, as 
was  the  open  scorn  Leiter  had  for  him.  Worse,  Leiter  was 
everything  Roach  is  not—charming,  urbane,  and  success-
ful  with  women.  Discrediting  Leiter  either  before  or  after 
his death, whether by stealing the papers as a premeditated 
theft or even as an act of opportunity postmortem, is not 
beyond  Roach  in  the  slightest.  Roach  has  (unknowingly) 
placed himself in the utmost danger. Well aware that if his 
guilt comes to light, his life and career are both effectively 
over, he will never admit to taking the papers nor give them 
up voluntarily without the most extreme coercion. 

Anthony Flinders, Misguided  
Undergraduate with an Unhealthy 
Obsession
A  handsome,  if  dourly  dressed  undergraduate,  looking 
every  inch  one  of  the  Miskatonic  University’s  more  well-
heeled  students  in  bearing  and  manner.  Behind  Anthony 
Flinders’  clipped,  upstate  New York  diction  and  well-bred 
air is the mind of a fanatic, and a misguided one. Anthony 
Flinders is a history student, one that tried repeatedly and 
unsuccessfully  to  attach  himself  to  Professor  Leiter’s  team 
and  the  categorizing 
of  the  Hobbhouse  Pa-
pers,  and  who  was  re-
peatedly  rebuffed.  His 
interests,  so  claimed 
were purely in the pur-
suit  of  his  proposed 
thesis,  which  focuses 
on  the  Arkham  Witch 
Trials,  and  the  refusal 
on Leiter’s part was an 
instance  of  the  man, 
while being a criminal 
and  forger,  being  a 
good  judge  of  char-
acter.  Enquiries  about 
Flinders  on  campus 
will  reveal  somebody 
who  superficially  fits 

Anthony Flinders

in  and  a  student  with  an  unremarkable  academic  record 
who takes part in the life of the university at least in a cur-
sory  fashion.  However,  detailed  questioning  will  reveal  no 
close friends anybody can point to, coupled with a certain 
underlying  unease  about  him  from  those  who  have  spent 
extended time with the man.

Anthony  Flinders  is  not  merely  focusing  his  historical 
studies  on  the  witch  trials,  he  is  obsessed  with  them  and 
worse,  secretly  he  is  a  true  believer—a  self-made  Satanist, 
a cult of one whose creed is mangled from a dozen biblical 
and  historical  sources,  but  one  who  is  woefully,  suicidally 
ignorant of the truth. 

Facts and Clues

T  Flinders knows relatively little about the true course 
of  events  but  possesses  an  obsessive’s  knowledge 
about the Arkham Witch Trials, the legend of Keziah 
Mason, and Arkham folklore. He believes the Witch 
Trial  Papers  contain  "true  magical  formulae"  that 
will enable him to make a Faustian pact, but will not 
divulge this fact unless under extreme duress.
T  In the lead-up to Leiter’s death, he intermittently fol-
lowed and observed the professor and may be aware of 
Leiter’s growing paranoia and one or more of Leiter’s 
contacts, such as Lucy Stone, Cecil Hunter, or Abner 
Wick, but will not give up this information willingly.
T  He broke into Leiter’s house on September the 11th in 
search of the papers. On failing to find them, he made 
do with stealing some minor personal possessions.

Roleplaying hooks

T  Enthusiastic to secure the papers for his own private 

purposes.

T  Will  "help"  the  investigators—whether  they  want 

him to or not.

T  Full  of  crazy  ideas,  which  he  will  try  to  present  as 
plausible theories to the investigators, such as, "Fal-
lon  has  stolen  the  Witch  Trial  Papers  for  profit," 
"Fallon  and  Roach  are  lovers  and  conduct  black 
magic  rituals,"  "Court  is  a  witch  who  killed  Leiter 
and has the papers."

Keeper’s Notes: Flinders can serve a number of purpos-
es, not least as antagonist and spoiling factor. A borderline 
psychotic and certainly delusional, he’s perfectly willing to 
use violence to achieve his aims, so long as he believes he can 
get away with it or the reward outweighs the risk. If snubbed, 
he  will  balk  at  open  attack  for  fear  of  being  overpowered 
or arrested. Stalking and attacking an isolated investigator, 
arson of lodgings, and faking a hit and run accident in an 
automobile  are  all  within  his  capabilities.  He  is  after  the 
Witch Trial Papers, and will act against the investigators if he 
believes this is in his interest; staging break ins, following the 
investigators,  attacking  witnesses,  and  generally  making  a 
menace of himself. He will seek to steal hair or nail clippings 
for use in curses. He is a malevolent, petty soul who craves 
power and dominion over others.

371 

chapter 15: scenariosIf  chosen  as  the  culprit:  If  the  Keeper  has  chosen 
Flinders to be guilty of the theft then he will have followed 
Leiter  to  Hunter’s  apartment,  waited  until  night  and  then 
broken  in,  finding  the  now  insane  Hunter  and  taking  the 
Witch  Trial  Papers  for  himself.  He  now  has  a  tiger  by  the 
tail—strange  events  are  beginning  to  happen  around  him 
and his doom draws nigh (see Manifestations on page 379). 
Nightly he tries to discern the hidden truths concealed with-
in the papers, however he is near paralyzed in fear of what 
is recorded in the manuscripts and that his fate will be the 
same as Leiter’s. The Devil will not answer him, but sooner 
or later, something else will. 

Lucy Stone, Grieving Paramour
Stone  is  a  good-looking,  well-made  young  woman  in  her 
mid-twenties,  a  peroxide  blonde  with  a  sway  to  her  walk 
that turns heads. Despite the bloom of youth, Stone has al-
ready graduated from the school of hard knocks and has few 
illusions about the world, having been a child of the Bowery 
in New York, and having variously been a waitress, cigarette 
girl, maid, and artist’s model in a half-dozen towns and cit-
ies meandering north from her birthplace. If asked why she 
left the big city behind, she’ll smile and say knowingly, “In 
the big city, there’s a knockout on every corner, but a little 
glamor can get you places in a small town.”

She hooked up with Leiter earlier in the spring while wait-
ressing at a speakeasy called Hibb’s Roadhouse on the edge of 
Arkham.  He  was  handsome  and  clever  and  not  afraid  to  lay 
down some cash on a girl, which was all right by her. While her 
head told her she was no more than a passing thing to him, her 
heart played a different tune, and she fell for him more than 
a little. She never let this show, rightly guessing he’d drop her 
like a hot iron if he knew. This was the reason that when, as she 
will put it, “Things got twisted up,” she hung around and didn’t 
skip town straight away and still hasn’t. She wants to pay her 
last respects to Leiter and 
doesn’t  understand  why 
she is not allowed to see 
the body; after all he died 
of a heart attack, right? 

Facts and Clues

T  Stone  serves  as 
a  witness  to  the 
other 
side  of 
Charles  Leiter’s 
life.  As  Leiter 
liked  to show off 
in  private,  she 
knows  the  out-
line  of  his  book 
racket,  although 
she  paid 
little 
notice to many of the details. 

Lucy Stone

T  She knows that as well as a forger and dealer in rare 
books  (the  "no  questions  asked"  kind),  Leiter  was 
also  a  gambler  who  liked  to  play  at  being  a  high 

roller—he’d taken her twice to Atlantic City, in June 
and August of this year. She knew that the August 
trip had occasioned him losing big and he left ow-
ing  money  to  people  it  was  unwise  to  get  tangled 
up with. When the opportunity presents itself, she’ll 
break into Leiter’s cottage in search of hidden loot 
(she knows his secret hiding place).

T  If  asked  about  any  of  Leiter’s  contacts  used  in  his 
racket, she will mention that she knew he used an 
artist to help copy documents—a student of some 
kind  that  had  been  kicked  out  of  MU  a  few  years 
back—but doesn’t know a name. More solidly, she 
still has the business card (including shop address) 
of a local antique dealer who was a regular buyer—a 
man called Abner Wick. If asked about him, she will 
offer that she had met him “once or twice socially,” 
and  that  he  seemed  to  her  “a  real  old-fashioned 
gentleman, but you know, I doubt I was his type.”
T  She can attest to Leiter’s rising paranoia, instability 

and desire to skip town in his final weeks.

T  If asked if she herself felt in danger, she will mention 
a “creepy little college boy” she’s seen hanging around 
the  neighborhood  both  before  Leiter’s  death  and 
once or twice since (this is Anthony Flinders). Obser-
vant investigators (Psychology roll) may notice she’s 
hiding  something  more,  even  if  they  have  already 
managed to win her over. To draw further informa-
tion from her requires a Charm, Intimidate, or Per-
suade roll (note that Charm and Intimidate will be 
more difficult since she has 50%+ in both skill) and 
reveals  that  she  has  already  been  questioned  about 
Leiter’s death by two gangsters from the Atlantic City 
mob, who are interested in whether or not Leiter is in 
fact dead or if he has faked his death to avoid paying 
his debts—the sudden and mysterious nature of the 
death and the lack of a funeral has made their boss 
suspicious. While the questions stopped short of ac-
tual violence, the gangsters left her in no doubt as to 
the consequences of lying to them, as well as instruc-
tions to keep them informed if anything suspicious 
regarding Leiter showed up, “If she wanted to remain 
healthy.” Unless the investigators persuade her to tell 
them  this,  she’ll  be  calling  the  gangsters  at  Atlantic 
City as soon as they are gone.

will seize it.

Keeper’s Notes: Stone is ruled by her emotions as much 
as  her  head,  and  as  such  is  more  likely  to  help  the  inves-
tigators  if  she  thinks  they  are  trying  to  solve  the  mystery 
of  Leiter’s  death,  something  she  is  hungry  for  facts  about. 
She’s also susceptible to good old-fashioned bribery for her 
assistance, particularly if the investigators give her enough 
money to flee town. 

The Late Lucy Stone? Stone is in a precarious position; 
she doesn’t know it, but she’s the last living and sane witness 
to Charles Leiter’s activities. Therefore she’s a likely candi-
date  for  death  during  the  course  of  the  scenario,  perhaps 
because  of  the  investigators’  actions  or  the  lack  of  them. 
There are several parties who want what she knows and who 
are  quite  willing  to  dispose  of  her  so  she  cannot  tell  any-
body else her secrets, real or imagined—including Anthony 
Flinders  and  Abner  Wick.  She  could  also  fall  foul  of  the 
Atlantic City mob if they think she’s hiding something from 
them, and last but no means least, the Prisoner of the Pages 
may have her marked for death as well. If this latter doom is 
the case, make sure to have this foreshadowed appropriately 
(see Manifestations on page 379).

Abner Wick, Antiques Dealer and 
Degenerate
Wick is a large, fleshy and somewhat effete man, somewhere 
in his late-forties, who gives the impression of once having 
had a powerful physique now undone by years of indulgent 
living and excess. He has a slight sour odor, masked for the 
main part by his heavy use of cologne, and an underlying 
sickliness to his pallor that suggests some morbidity of the 
flesh, illness, or addiction 
afflicting the man. Wick, 
despite  any  unseemly 
physical  affects,  is  a  dis-
armingly  calm,  assured 
and  cultured  figure  who 
displays  effortless  man-
ners to all and a gentility 
of  a  kind  rarely  found 
in the rush of the 1920’s 
modern  age.  He  will  de-
scribe  himself  modestly 
as  a  "gentlemen  of  some 
small private means who 
dabbles  in  antiques  and 
beautiful old books,” and 
keeps  a  small  antiques 
shop,  called  Unconsid-
ered Trifles, in a side-street in the better quarter of Arkham’s 
commercial district. Like Wick himself, the shop has a rea-
sonable reputation in the trade and any investigators with 
antiquarian interests who hail from Arkham may well have 
visited  it  before,  although  are  unlikely  to  have  met  Wick 
himself as he leaves the day-to-day business of the shop to 
the hired help. So, at least, goes his public façade.

Abner Wick

Facts and Clues

T  Abner Wick conducted business with Charles Leiter 
on  several  occasions,  both  as  a  dealer  and  private 
collector of rare books and manuscripts.

T  He  was  part  of  a  bidding  war  for  the  Witch  Trial 
Papers, which had already reached several thousand 
dollars and threatened to go much higher.

T  Wick desired the papers for himself, however they had 
soon  gone  beyond  his  own  price  range,  although  he 
kept on as an agent for “several other interested par-
ties, with deeper pockets,” whose identities he will not 
disclose and if pressed will simply brand as “foreign.”
T  Wick felt betrayed by Leiter, assuming he had come 
to an arrangement with a buyer other than himself.
T  Wick  will  acknowledge  that  there  are  “dangerous 
forces  in  the  world  and  beyond  it,  not  given  men 
to  know,”  and  fears,  from  what  he  has  heard  since 
Charles Leiter’s death, that such forces gather around 
the papers. If asked to elaborate he will merely point to 
the history of tragedy that surrounds the Hobbhouse 
family  and  recent  events,  adding  that  any  danger  is 
likely  to  emanate “from  the  things  old  Hobbhouse 
seized at the trial,” rather than anything else.

T  He  is  still  interested  in  "acquiring"  the  papers  and 
will offer a price of several thousand dollars for the 
acquisition of the originals, "No questions asked.”

Roleplaying hooks

T  Wick  likes  to  be  in  charge.  He  will  try  to  use  the 

investigators as his pawns.

T  He wants the papers; can the investigators help?
T  He is keen to know all about Leiter’s death and the 
whereabouts of the body (perhaps for a tasty treat).

Keeper’s Notes: Abner Wick is a man of many secrets, 
masks  and  lies,  and  depending  on  the  chosen  role  the 
Keeper  has  determined  for  him,  some  or  all  of  these  may 
be revealed to the investigators over the course of the game. 
Wick possesses knowledge of the Mythos and so could pro-
vide singular insight into the death of Charles Leiter and its 
true causes—although he will much prefer to talk of such 
matters as, "dark possibilities" rather than in factual terms.  
The  Lies  of  Abner  Wick:  Abner  Wick’s  first  mask  of 
deception—that  of  gentleman  antiquarian—is  easily  dis-
pelled through his connection to Charles Leiter, which may 
be  discovered  either  by  studying  Leiter’s  notes  or  through 
conversations with Lucy Stone. This will reveal Wick to be 
a long-time client and go-between for Leiter’s forgery and 
thefts,  although  as  a  customer  rather  than  co-conspirator, 
and one Leiter was keen to keep on his side. 

The second mask that may be uncovered is that of Wick’s 
degeneracy and just how deep his corruption lies. Further 
investigation into Wick’s criminal connections, which range 
from Arkham to Maine, Boston, and Providence, will reveal 
a reputed dope-fiend (and maybe worse), a dealer in stolen 

373 

chapter 15: scenariosgoods (specifically antiques), and known fence with a rep-
utation for being able to lay his hands on big money for the 
right items. He is also known for being a man fatal to cross.  
The  third  mask,  and  one  the  investigators  are  unlikely 
to see behind, is that of humanity. Abner Wick is a cannibal 
and murderer, whose contaminated blood carries the stain 
of the jackals of the earth. Once a changeling child, whose 
mother bore him in the lightless depths of the ghoul-bur-
rowed  passages  in  the  charnel  depths  beneath  the  city  of 
Boston  nearly  a  hundred  years  ago,  he  was  a  hybrid-bas-
tard, fostered upon a wealthy family whose own babe was 
devoured in darkness. His transformation from human to 
fully-fledged ghoul has been slow and long. His long-estab-
lished  taste  for  fresh  human  flesh,  particularly  that  of  the 
young,  is  slowly  degenerating  into  a  taste  for  rotten  carri-
on—a sure sign he will (within a decade or so) pass below 
into the darkness. Until then he will serve as he has served 
in the past, as a go-between between the world above and 
the  shadows  below:  a  procurer  of  flesh  and  treasures,  and 
a dealer in the spoils of the dead to humankind, who are so 
easily bought-off with baubles and trash.

Hector  &  Carla:  Despite  his  power,  Wick  prefers  any 
dirty work done at a remove by underlings bound to him 
by tainted blood, only doing his own killing when far from 
the  public  eye  or  possible  discovery.  The  profiles  for  two 
of his minions, Hector and Carla Fademan, a pair of local 
siblings whose ghoul-taint is somewhat further along than 
Wick’s own (and who also lack their master’s considerable 
intelligence and charm), are provided in the NPC section. 
They serve as workers, kidnappers, thieves, and murderers 
as required. 

If Wick believes the investigators are worthy of his atten-
tion, he will have Hector and Carla follow and observe them 
to learn the direction of their enquiries, or if he suspects the 
investigators now have the papers he may send Hector and 
Carla to retrieve them.

Beyond this Scenario: Depending on the investigators’ 
personal dealings with Wick, he can make for a very useful 
contact in the future and a potential source of both infor-
mation  and  employment,  albeit  a  hugely  dangerous  and 
corrupting one.

If chosen as the Culprit: If Wick is the Keeper’s chosen 
culprit then his desire for the Witch Trial Papers was great 
enough for him to simply do away with the pretense of the 
bidding war and have them taken directly from the forger 
Cecil Hunter in the night by his less-than-human servants 
(which may have had more than a small part in Hunter’s fi-
nal breakdown). If he feels the investigators suspect him, he 
will use Hector and Carla to throw the investigators off the 
scent, perhaps using them to draw attention to a different 
suspect,  or  he  will  send  his  minions  to  attack  and  kill  the 
meddlesome investigators. He knows full well the dangers of 
the horror Leiter and Hunter have inadvertently all but set 
loose and will be in preparations for a ritual to appease and 
bind the entity to his will—a ritual destined to be performed 
either  in  the  bowels  of  his  shop  or  perhaps  in  the  ruined 
Hobbhouse Manse if the Keeper prefers. The ritual will re-
quire some victims to feed the entity’s desire for destruction 

and suitable candidates will likely include anyone with ties 
to  the  affair,  be  they  Lucy  Stone,  a  luckless  interloper  like 
Anthony Flinders or the investigators themselves.

and through informants at the speakeasy where she works, 
and they will take a close interest in anybody who takes an 
interest in her—like the investigators.

Oaks and Shaunassy

Facts and Clues

T  The Atlantic City hoods are largely ignorant of the 
truth;  they  think  Leiter’s  alive  and  are  looking  for 
him. Anything short of showing them Leiter’s body 
stands  little  chance  of  convincing  them  that  he  is 
genuinely  dead,  and  even  this  they  may  disbelieve 
given the poor state of the corpse.  They are strongly 
inclined to disbelieve in Leiter’s death, so any rolls to 
appease them are Extreme .

T  They  are  tasked  with  the  collection  of  a  gambling 
debt—$11,000  dollars  to  be  precise—and  if  they 
discover the Witch Trial Papers’ existence and worth, 
the Keeper may decide that they will go after them 
(knowing that they have value is enough—they will 
leave the rest to their bosses). 

374 

Call of CthulhuT  They will resort to threats and casual violence as a 
matter of course, but stay shy of public displays that 
will  attract  the  attention  of  the  law.  They  will  not 
engage in willful murder unless attacked themselves. 
They  are  armed  with  knuckledusters,  straight  ra-
zors, and heavy-caliber pistols, and will try to isolate 
a target rather than risk getting outnumbered.

Roleplaying hooks

T  Desirous to collect on Leiter’s debt.
T  Aggressively curious about everything and everyone.
T  Will want concrete proof of Leiter’s death.
Keeper’s Note: These two are a deliberate spoiling factor 
for the scenario; a rival to the investigators who can either 
be played as a serious threat or just as a sideline encounter 
as the Keeper wishes. They can also be used to provide some 
physical action (i.e. a stand-up fight) to your game as well. 
They can also serve both as unlikely allies for the investiga-
tors or as fodder for the real villain (or the Horror from the 
Pages) if they get too close to the truth.

A  good  way  of  introducing  the  hoods  is  to  have  them 
pay a visit to Leiter’s cottage when the investigators are there 
searching  for  clues.  Depending  on  the  investigators’  reac-
tions, the duo may play it cool and simply say that they want 
Leiter and the money owed, or they may be more direct, say-
ing that all they want is the money and they don't care where 
it comes from—if they can’t find Leiter, the investigators are 
just as good a source for the cash (being in Leiter’s home and 
inheriting the debt by association). Should the investigators 
react violently, the duo will not shirk from a fight, however 
they are more likely to retreat and ambush the investigators 
at a later stage.

Cecil Hunter, Insane Forger
Hunter is a reedy, thin-faced man in his late-twenties with a 
freckled face and a shock of reddish-blond hair. When met 
he  will  likely  be  straightjacketed  and  under  observation, 
phasing  in  and  out  of  rational  thought  and  morbid  mut-
terings about, “Worms seething in the walls!” and reciting 
fractured  lines  of  Edgar  Allan  Poe.  He  resides  currently 
within  the  Admissions  Ward  of  the  Arkham  Sanatorium, 
his connection to the Witch Trial affair utterly unknown to 
anybody  at  the  Miskatonic  University,  having  been  placed 
there  by  Leiter  not  long  before  that  man’s  death.  Leiter 
passed himself off as a concerned ex-tutor, claiming to have 
visited  a  troubled  student  to  find  him  a  degenerate  state, 
thus  leaving  him  in  the  doctor’s  care  with  the  promise  of 
contacting Hunter’s family with the news—simply stalling 
for time on Leiter’s part. 

Hunter, a bohemian who was expelled from Miskatonic 
University some four years ago for licentious conduct, has for 
some time had a profitable secret relationship with Leiter, as-
sisting him in the more artistic aspects of historical forgeries. 
He lived in a studio apartment above a shabby washhouse in 
one of Arkham’s poorer neighborhoods and held court with 
a  variety  of  other  dissolute  types  when  he  was  in  money; 

the  proceeds  of  forgery 
being  his  sole  income. 
In  attempting  to  unravel 
and  copy  the  occult  text 
within  the  Witch  Trial 
Papers,  he  accidentally 
undid the bindings on the 
entity imprisoned within 
them.  He  was  subject  to 
the first major manifesta-
tion  of  the  horror  and 
the  experience  caused  a 
shattering  of  the  artist’s 
sanity.  The  creature  will 
return  again,  sooner  or 
later.

Facts and Clues

Cecil Hunter

T  Hunter  was  admitted  to  Arkham  Sanatorium  on 
September  17th,  suffering  a  profound  nervous 
breakdown and is considered as a danger to himself, 
having  partly  chewed  through  the  tendons  on  the 
backs of his own hands. Since then he has responded 
well  to  medication,  but  remains  withdrawn,  inco-
herent, and easily agitated.

T  He  was  admitted  by  a  self-professed  former  tutor, 
Professor Charles Leiter, who displayed his credentials 
and who claimed to have found the young man in this 
state at his home. Leiter promised to inform the man’s 
family and return, but no family has come forward.
T  The Horror may possess Hunter and have him escape.

Roleplaying hooks

T  Hunter is anxious to get the papers back so he can 

complete his work.

T  He wants to get out of the sanatorium, by any means.
T  He  begs  for  company  and  is  afraid  to  spend  time 
alone. If he escapes he may seek out the investiga-
tors’ company if they were sympathetic.

Manifestation: The investigators perhaps hear the voice 
of the patient in the padded cell next door… Only he killed 
himself last night and the room was emptied this morning.
Semi-lucid  statements  triggered  by  certain  words: 
Hunter is distracted, incoherent, and incapable of conduct-
ing  a  rational  conversation—and  that’s  when  calm  and 
partly sedated. However, if the investigators talk with him, 
certain words and phrases they might use will trigger perti-
nent statements about the recent past, which Hunter’s mind 
can  only  now  approach  obliquely.  The  Keeper  should  feel 
free to paraphrase and add to the following examples.

Forgery: “Money,  only  money,  false  art,  but  we  all  sell 

our souls in our way.”

Witch/Which:  “Her,  it  was  her  trial,  her  papers,  her 
name,  her  symbols,  her  prisoner,  stupid,  stupid,  stupid. 
I can hear her laughing. The cries, oh god the cries of the 
new-borns on her table.”

chapter 15: scenariosLeiter: “Dead man, dead man, he saw them and they saw 
him, and off we go… Out–out are the lights–out all! And, 
over each quivering form, the curtain, a funeral pall, comes 
down with the rush of a storm. And the angels, all pallid and 
wan, uprising, unveiling, affirm that the play is the tragedy: 
"Man, and its hero the Conqueror Worm!”

Investigators succeeding in a Hard Own Language roll 
will identify the last part of this as a direct quote from Edgar 
Allan Poe.

Sale/buyer:  “Oh  money,  it  was  all  the  money  with 
him, no love of art, no real understanding, all dollars and 
cents.  Oh  he  got  offers  now  though  didn’t  he,  money  and 
money and money (laughs). He was happy at first, so happy, 
thought he’d hit the big one, we both did, poor old me, keep 
me in paints and good whiskey and pretty girls eh. But the 
price kept going up and up and up and up, until we were so 
scared…right to be scared…the truth…(screams)”

Wick:  “No,  no,  not  him,  bad  man,  bad  man,  eats  and 
eats and eats, you can hear them in his shop! Whispering, 
plotting, licking and licking, rats, rats in the walls, old dirty 
earth.”

Lucy: “Sees her, sees her next, pretty, pretty, all worms, 
worms,  poor  thing,  poor  Lucy,  Lucy  pours,  waiting  tables 
waiting tables, waiting…waiting…”

What did you see?/What happened at the Studio?: “You 
see,  oh  dear  god,  what  have  we  done,  not  out,  not  all  the 
way out, but soon. Can’t you hear it, smashing at the walls, 
screaming in the wind? It will be free and then—Oh God—
it wasn’t my fault, broken geometry, flaw, flawed copy, in the 
lines and the angles, you imbecile, don’t you see?”

Further Advice For the 
Keeper
There  is  no  exact  "right"  or  "wrong"  path  in  Crimson  Let-
ters, regardless of which NPC has been chosen as the thief 
of  the  Witch  Trial  Papers.  This  being  said,  however,  some 
approaches and leads will be more effective than others, and 
clever players, rather than any other factor, can short circuit 
their way to the truth often faster than a Keeper will predict. 
This  is  not  an  occurrence  to  be  avoided  and  the  Keeper 
should not be afraid to expand the narrative in any inter-
esting  directions  the  players  choose  to  explore;  rounding 
out the fictional world of the game to accommodate them 
where needed, but also to subtly bring them back round if 
they stray too far away from the plot needlessly. This latter 
activity is always best done within the game than out of it 
and ideally the players should never guess when it happens 
and, just as in any game, the Keeper should remember that 
the clues, encounters, and key events of the scenario are not 
sealed inviolably in cold print, but should appear where and 
when the Keeper chooses to locate them. 

The  Keeper  should  never  be  afraid  of  adverse  conse-
quences  to  the  investigators’  actions  (up  to  the  point  of 
simply  destroying  them  out  of  hand  of  course,  which  is 
largely  unsatisfactory  for  everybody  in  the  game!),  when 
they  are  merited  and  logical  within  the  story  and  plot  of 

the scenario. The wrong question in the wrong ear, public 
displays of force or general heavy-handedness in conducting 
their business may tip the thief to the investigator’s actions 
and paint them as a threat to be dealt with, by fair means 
or foul. This might turn the tables on the player characters, 
who themselves might then become subject to investigation, 
pursuit, pressure, and even attack, all of which can make for 
a richer and more thrilling game. 

Pacing and menace are something for the Keeper to focus 
on and if the investigators rapidly run through the investigation 
the Keeper should not be afraid to add in extra complications 
and dangers to slow them down a little: throw in some false 
leads, have one of the NPCs be out of town for a few days, kill an 
NPC unexpectedly or put the investigators in unexpected dan-
ger! The earlier stages of this scenario are investigative in nature 
and Keepers wishing to spice things up may create drama and 
action with a manifestation of the Horror (remember this may 
occur in locations where the Witch Trial Papers have been, and 
the Horror will be seeking out and possibly possessing anyone 
who has touched the papers). When events escalate, the police 
are likely to become involved, leading to further complications 
for the players. Keepers should remember the Idea roll if the 
players become stuck.

In desperation the thief might contrive to have the inves-
tigators handle the papers, in an attempt to compel others to 
join the struggle against the Horror.

A  successful  conclusion  of  the  scenario  will  be  all  the 
more  enjoyable  if  the  players  have  to  be  creative  in  their 
struggle to resolve it—after all, roleplaying games are about 
the experience of play, not who’s first over the finish line!  

Doing the Legwork
The  following  is  a  list  of  other  clues,  locations  and  other 
evidence  that  can  be  gleaned  from  general  investigations 
into Leiter’s prior dealings, living space, and movements, as 
well as some possible encounters along the way. The Keeper 
should feel free to add to these or judiciously place the infor-
mation they offer elsewhere in the path of the investigators 
as required.

Locations
Leiter’s Cottage
A small, nicely appointed cottage near the campus, one of 
a  number  of  similar  homes  owned  by  the  University  and 
rented out to faculty members. 

The back door lock has recently been replaced and new 
bolts  added  to  the  doors  and  windows.  The  place  is  in  a 
state of semi-organized chaos; Leiter clearly having been in 
the  process  of  getting  ready  to  leave. Various  (incriminat-
ing)  papers  have  been  hastily  burnt  in  the  fireplace  in  the 
lounge—a possible place for clues, such as the burnt rem-
nants of a letter from Arkham Sanitarium, a diary date with 
Lucy Stone, or proposal of interest from Abner Wick.

Call of CthulhuLeiter’s  desk  is  cluttered  with  all 
manner  of  papers  (mostly  of 
little 
importance),  however  details  of  his 
financial  dealings  can  be  uncovered 
(as  Roach  has  already  done).  A  pocket 
notebook  shows  Leiter’s  accounts,  with 
details  of  repeated  influxes  of  cash  in 
the  thousands  of  dollars  and  its  rapid 
removal,  the  sums  involved  being  far 
beyond  a  university  professor’s  means. 
Travel tickets and receipts for numerous 
trips to Atlantic City may also be in evi-
dence, as is a receipt for the replacement 
of  the  cottage’s  locks  and  bolts  (dated 
September 12th).

An unopened letter lies on the door-
mat  from  the  local  sanatorium  (which 
Roach mistook for a circular). This letter 
is  a  notice  of  admission  and  request  to 
visit regarding the case of one C. Hunter, 
of  whom  Professor  Leiter  has  assumed 
temporary guardianship.

Partial forgeries, along with one thou-
sand dollars in cash, are well hidden in a 
secret hiding place known only to Leiter 
and  Lucy  Stone,  requiring  either  Lucy’s 
help or a Spot Hidden roll to locate.

Leiter’s Office at the 
University
Leiter’s office on campus is a small affair, 
with  a  single  desk,  some  filing  cabinets 
and a fireplace. On the wall is a shattered 
mirror,  which  if  carefully  studied  will 
be  found  to  be  partially  melted.  It  was 
this  mirror  that  Leiter  looked  into  on 
the  night  of  his  death,  staring  into  the 
abysmal horror that burnt out his soul. 
Study  of  the  mirror  may  lead  to  some 
unfortunate event; perhaps a part of the 
monster  still  lies  within  the  glass  (see 
Signs of Passage).

The office is next to a smaller room where Emilia Court 

undertakes her work as Leiter’s assistant and secretary.

An  inspection  of  the  office  reveals  little  (Leiter  spent  at 
least half of his time working at home—a fact easily verified 
by Emilia Court). A number of letters and documents appear 
to have been burnt in the fireplace. If questioned about this, 
Court will say that this must have happened on the night of 
Leiter’s  death.  Searching  through  the  filing  cabinets  reveals 
that a number of (incriminating) files are missing, presum-
ably burnt in the fireplace (or perhaps taken by Roach).

The Keeper may wish to plant other clues here, such as 
a matchbook for Hibb’s Roadhouse (perhaps written on by 
Lucy  Stone),  a  piece  of  art  by  Cecil  Hunter,  or  perhaps  a 
casino poker chip (fallen down the back of the desk).

Hibb’s Roadhouse
A  raucous  but  reasonably  upmarket  establishment  on  the 
edge  of Arkham,  catering  to  the  illicit  drinking  needs  of  the 
university town. The establishment is split in two: a soft juice 
and coffee bar (acting as the front for the speakeasy), and a back 
room where illegal liquor is served. Here can be found Lucy 
Stone and potentially the Atlantic City hoods or those that will 
happily take their money to rat out the investigators to them.

The Hobbhouse Manse
The  Hobbhouse  Manse  is  a  ramshackle  late-colonial 
three-story  house  set  in  overgrown  grounds,  lonely  and 
desolate, about a half-hour’s drive from Arkham proper. 

377 

chapter 15: scenariosThe  manse  represents  a  continuum  with 
Arkham’s  dark  past  within  this  scenario  and 
may provide an atmospheric side-journey for 
the investigators, and an avenue by which the 
Keeper can further stoke tension and a sense 
of brooding malice behind unfolding events. 
It  is  a  mournful  and  now  emptied  house, 
shrouded  in  dust  and  utterly  hollow  with  ab-
sence, and its approach is a singularly brooding 
and  desolate  stretch  of  countryside  woodland 
that serves to isolate it from the town of Arkham. 
Investigators who take time to search around the 
Manse are likely to witness one or more of the 
Horror’s manifestations—see Signs of Passage.
Details  of  the  Manse  have  been  left  rela-
tively  sparse,  allowing  Keepers  to  develop  its 
secrets and contents at their discretion, possi-
bly providing hooks to later scenarios. 

Unconsidered Trifles
Abner Wick’s shop is a respectable and estab-
lished  antiques  business,  not  large  but  well 
regarded in the local trade—Wick insures that 
any  goods  of  traceably  dubious  origin  never 
see the front of store. 

There  is  an  office  on  the  floor  above  the 
shop, while at the rear of the store is storeroom 
and loading yard. In the storeroom is a door 
that leads down into a copious basement filled 
with packing cases and a rackety old boiler. 

A successful Spot Hidden roll in the base-
ment will reveal a partially concealed trapdoor 
that  leads  down  to  a  maze-like  subbasement 
filled  with  old  packing  cases,  chests,  busted 
coffins, and bones—lots of bones, mostly hu-
man. Some of the bones have been fashioned 
into torches, chairs, desks, and similar maca-
bre paraphernalia. At the center and far below 
street level is a chamber, the center of which is a brick-lined 
well  that  drops  away  to  darkness,  where  the  ghouls  dwell. 
Here  is  a  charnel  shrine  and  the  effects  of  the  occult  and 
dark lore (if Wick possesses the Witch Trial Papers, they will 
be found here). 

The  subbasements  of  the  antiques  shop  are  a  death 
trap—at least one and possibly more of Wick’s servants are 
in  residence  down  here  at  any  time  and  any  alarm  or  the 
sound of gunfire is likely to bring ghouls from below. 

Should Wick’s secret be discovered and exposure threat-
ened, the shop will be gutted by fire and the basements col-
lapsed (before any authorities might pry), leaving no trace 
of the tunnels. 

Keeper’s Note:
Keepers should always remain responsive to the 
actions of their players and flexible in their 
delivery of the written scenario. This may require 
the Keeper to improvise a new aspect of the 
scenario or situation on the fly. A short example 
of actual play is included here to illustrate this. 
Such unscripted incidents can be the highlight 
of a game and talked about by all involved for long 
afterwards.

During a playtest, the investigators decided 
to visit the Hobbhouse Manse late in both the 
scenario and the gaming session. The Keeper didn’t 
want to diminish the tension that had built up 
when the players realized the location was a red 
herring, so he determined it would be the perfect 
place to introduce Oaks and Shaunassy. After 
an uneventful search through the house, the 
investigators emerged to find the Manse’s driveway 
blocked by the gangsters' car. The investigators 
told the gangsters that Leiter was in the morgue 
and agreed to ride back with the gangsters to 
show them, letting Flinders, who had attached 
himself to them by now, follow with their car. 
Since this was the third time they had visited 
the corpse (the first alone and the second with 
Lucy), Dr. Wheatcroft was getting ready to take 
an impromptu vacation, but agreed to one last 
visit, reassured by the number of people who 
would be accompanying him. Shaunassy pulled 
out a newspaper clipping of a picture of Lieter 
receiving an academic award and held it next to 
the corpse’s face so he could make sure it was 
the same man. The corpse took the  
opportunity to grab (and break) Shaunassy’s 
wrist, Dr. Wheatcroft failed his Sanity roll and 
fainted, and a fight ensued!

Other Clues

Visiting the Police

Detective Lt. Bill Somerset is responsible for the Leiter case. 
He can confirm that Leiter died of a heart attack and that as 
far as he is concerned, the case is closed. If questioned about 
the  unusual  circumstances  of  the  case  (the  body  found  in 
a locked office, the look of terror on Leiter’s face, etc.), and 
presuming they have made a good impression, Somerset will 
level  with  the  investigators  and  tell  them  that  he  has  easier 
cases to solve and that he has no mind nor time for chasing 
up freakish ones. 

Of course, if the investigators give Somerset a hard time 
or push him too far, he may take an interest in them, perhaps 
putting a tail on them or looking into their business dealings 
to see if there’s any trouble he can cause them. Somerset is 
easy-going most of the time; however, if he feels someone 
needs teaching a lesson in respect for law, he is not beyond 
using his extensive resources to make life difficult for them.

Call of CthulhuThe Hobbhouse Arkham 
Witch Trial Papers

The  Hobbhouse  Arkham  Witch  Trial  Papers  com-
prise a leather folio, closed with academic satchel-
straps,  containing  a  sheaf  of  some  sixty  unbound 
pages. These collated pages are hand-written docu-
ments dating back to the early seventeen-hundreds 
and comprise a record of personal correspondence 
between the jurist Caleb Hobbhouse and a number 
of notable legal and spiritual authorities in colonial 
New England. 

The letters focus upon the 1690s Arkham Witch 
Trials  (in  which  Hobbhouse  had  taken  part),  the 
witch-panic’s causes and nature, and Hobbhouse’s 
fears of the escape of the true instigators of evil from 
the court’s hands. Among the letters are a number 
of  trial  extracts,  sworn  testimonies,  and  about  a 
dozen closely illustrated pages showing geometric 
or alchemical formulae, with diagrams purported to 
be from the possession of the convicted witch and 
child-killer,  Keziah  Mason,  thought  never  to  have 
been replicated elsewhere. 

Arkham Witch Trial Papers
English, Caleb Hobbhouse, Circa 1707
Sanity loss: 1D6
Cthulhu Mythos: +1/+2 percentiles

tion (Warding).

and  then  back  into  the  unknowable  voids  from  whence  it 
was  first  drawn.  Its  attacks  on  the  barriers  of  reality  take 
the form of a series of manifestations of increasing severity, 
manifestations  in  which  the  Horror  itself  will  appear  first 
as a spectral form that gains power and solidity with each 
subsequent appearance—the disruptive aftershocks of these 
breaches will begin to play havoc on the world around it. 

The exact nature and frequency of these manifestations 
is  left  up  to  the  Keeper,  and  they  should  quickly  build  in 
severity. Manifestations should occur in some proximity to 
either the Witch Trial Papers themselves or to any who have 
touched them; a list of individuals which includes: the Cobb 
family,  Leiter’s  corpse,  Emilia  Court,  Cecil  Hunter,  Lucy 
Stone and, of course, whoever the Keeper has selected as the 
culprit of the theft (see Signs of Passage).

Within a short time, the Horror in Ink will break free and 
those  nearby  will  die  in  an  indescribably  horrific  manner, 
the Horror wreaking havoc akin to a sudden tornado before 
it departs. If this occurs within the bounds of Arkham or the 
university, the death toll will be considerable. 

A Dinner Party with Mister Wick

A Telegram from the Asylum

A suitable additional clue, should the investigators become 
stuck  (or  just  to  add  tension),  is  for  a  telegram  from  the 
sanatorium to arrive at the university, addressed to Profes-
sor  Charles  Leiter.  The  telegram,  inquiring  about  matters 
relating  to  the  care  of  one  Cecil  Hunter,  will  of  course  be 
immediately snapped up by Dean Fallon and handed to the 
investigators to deal with.

An Invitation to Dine with Mister 
Abner Wick
Once the investigators have gotten their teeth into the affair 
and pursued a few leads, it will be appropriate for them to 
receive a formal invitation to dinner at Crawford’s Restau-
rant,    the  best  and  most  expensive  restaurant  in  Arkham, 
with Mister Abner Wick, "Antiquarian" as his business card 
will relate. He plans to ascertain their interest in the matter 
of the Witch Trial Papers, inquire into the death of his busi-
ness acquaintance and pick their brains (in a non-literal way 
for the moment) about what is happening. 

Manifestations of Horror
In  the  attempt  to  copy  the  illustrated  formula  from  the 
Witch Trial Papers, the forger Cecil Hunter partly unraveled 
the binding that the witch Keziah Mason had placed upon 
an entity under her thrall, a Horror bound in blood and ink 
within angles and lines upon the page. 

Now partly free, the Horror is hammering at the walls 
of reality and will soon break through, first into our world, 

379

The  following  are  a  list  of  potential 
manifestations  of  the  Horror  and  its 
growing effects. Within a half mile or so 
of its location the effect will be noticeably 
investigators 
pronounced  and  smart 
might well use this fact to narrow down 
their  suspects  and  searches.  Keepers  are 
encouraged to create their own manifes-
tations, using the following as guidance.

Anyone  who  has  touched  the  Witch 
Trial  Papers  may  encounter  any  or  all  of 
the  manifestations.  The  following  are 
listed in a suggested order of occurrence.

T  The  Oncoming  Storm:  Radios, 
batteries,  and  electrical  systems

fuses  blow  unexpectedly  and

inexplicably.  This 

T  Witch Fire: Eerie reddish lights are 
seen in the distance and may be re-
ported at places of note such as the 
legendary  Witch  House  of  Keziah 
Mason,  the  Hobbhouse  Manse, 
Hunter’s Studio, Leiter’s cottage, or 
anywhere else deemed appropriate 
by the Keeper. Witnesses may later 
complain  of  illness,  fatigue,  and 
headaches, while the lights may be 
the  source  of  a  spate  of  false  fire 
reports to the authorities. 

T  Bumps  in  the  Night:  The  Horror 
will  cause  disturbances  near  to 
those who have touched the papers. 
A  presence  will  be  sensed  nearby; 
someone enters the room, but when you turn there 
is no one there; footsteps sound in the vacant room 
above; telephones ring, if answered only whispering 
voices can be heard.

T  Possession: Whether dead or alive, those that have 
touched  the  papers  are  open  to  possession  by  the 
Horror.  Through the possessed victim, the Horror 
will  use  its  Soul  Burn  (in  addition  to  the  victim’s 
normal attacks) to attack those nearby. If a corpse is 
possessed it acts as a Zombie (see page 335).
T  Apparition: The Horror will partly manifest, leaving a 
trail of madness and death in its wake before its final, 
full  manifestation  into  reality.  Witnessing  a  partial 
manifestation calls for a Sanity roll (1/1D4 SAN loss).

Combating the Horror
There  are  perhaps  three  principal  means  of  trying  to  put 
an  end  the  Horror  before  it  fully  manifests.  The  first  is  to 
take the original illustrated portion of the Witch Trial  Pa-
pers, as well as the half-copies, and put them well away from 
anywhere  they  can  do  direct  harm—the  efficacy  of  this  is 
up to the Keeper, as this is akin to sending a bomb away to 
explode in someone else’s yard, and the Horror’s visitation 
is not confined to just a place but also to those that have had 
prolonged contact with the Witch Trial Papers. 

The second and perhaps most obvious way is to destroy 
the illustrated portion of the papers (as this is the only place 
the danger actually lies). Doing so is also a risky business, as 
the Horror will immediately manifest in a frenzy, attacking 
as  it  unravels  into  the  Æther  until  it  disintegrates,  leaving 

380 

Call of Cthulhuonly a bloody, tar-like residue in its wake (a process that will 
take  1D6  rounds).  As  a  side  note,  Abner  Wick  is  the  only 
NPC in this scenario able to contain and deal with the Hor-
ror successfully, although he will demand ownership of the 
papers for doing so, and the methods he will use are such 
that the investigators would prefer to remain ignorant of.

The  third  possibility  is  the  optional  Spontaneous  use 
of Cthulhu Mythos skill (see page 180). If the investigators 
lack the skill, they can gain some points with an Initial Read-
ing of the papers (granted after an evening’s study). The goal 
in using this skill is up to the player, perhaps dispelling the 
monster from the papers. In desperation the player may seek 
to push the roll and fail, leading to dire consequences, and a 
horrific conclusion to the scenario. 

Resolving the Affair
If the investigators successfully find the Witch Trial Papers 
before the Horror’s final manifestation, they can choose to 
deal  with  the  dangerous  part  themselves  and/or  hand  off 
the papers to either Dean Fallon or another interested party. 
Alternatively they may fail at either or both of these goals.

If  they  succeed  in  returning  the  Witch  Trial  Papers  in 
whole  or  part,  or  even  forgeries,  to  Dean  Fallon,  they  will 
gain him as a professional contact of good standing, as well 
as  being  financially  rewarded  to  an  agreed  sum  or  $250 
dollars  each.  However  this  will  not  stop  the  Horror  from 
manifesting  (unless  they  have  somehow  neutralized  the 
entity), and, should the Keeper wish, it will hunt down the 
investigators.  Perhaps  the  investigators  may  realize  things 
are  not  at  an  end  when  in  the  following  day’s  newspaper 
they read the front page to see that Dean Fallon (who has 
not yet paid them) has been horribly murdered in a brutal 
and bizarre manner (by the Horror).

If  they  succeed  in  battling  the  Horror  and  preventing 
its  full,  unimpeded  manifestation,  they  should  gain  +1D6 
Sanity points. 

If  they  fail  and  the  Horror  manifests  somewhere  in 
Arkham, and the death toll is high, they each should make 
a  Sanity  roll  as  they  come  to  terms  with  their  failure  to 
prevent the loss of life (1D3/1D10 SAN loss). If the Horror 
manifests  somewhere  beyond  Arkham,  where  the  effects 
are minimized with little loss of life, apply 0/1D4 SAN loss 
instead.

chapter 15: scenariosOnce the Dust has Settled
Keepers wishing to continue the story set up in this scenario 
may wish to consider the following possibilities in devising 
further adventures for the investigators.

The  Other  Buyers:  Aside  from  Abner  Wick,  Leiter  was 
beset  with  offers  for  the  papers  from  a  range  of  unsavory 
people. While such individuals have remained in the shadows 
during the scenario, they may decide to take an active inter-
est in determining the fate of the papers and Leiter. Perhaps 
they reach out to the investigators and, in so doing, draw the 
investigators into another series of mysterious events.

Abner Wick: Dependent on the events in the scenario, 
Abner  Wick’s  business  and  personal  interests  provide  a 
rich  source  of  inspiration  for  Keepers  to  explore.  Perhaps 
the investigators uncover his name in the course of another 
scenario  that  leads  back  to  Unconsidered  Trifles  and  the 
hideous caves beneath. 

Non-Player Characters
Rather than provide an exhaustive list of skills, only the key 
ones expected to come up in play are provided. The Keeper 
should feel free to fill in the blanks.

THE HORROR IN INK, Malevolent Monster

The  Horror  itself  is  utterly  malign  and  alien,  its  sentience 
incomprehensible in human terms. The shape human per-
ception will try to ascribe to the Horror when it manifests 
is of a shifting, hulking, almost bear-like mass made up of 
glowing, shimmering reddish-black worms, akin in color to 
boiling blood and dying cinders.

When fully manifest it will attempt to seize and embrace its victim

Constant use of this attack is what killed Leiter.

freely  through  solid  objects;  thus  doors,  swords  and  bullets 
present no challenge. Magical weapons may damage and affect 
the Horror at the Keeper’s discretion.

Possession: Can possess anyone who has touched the Witch Trial 
Papers. Victims  must  make  an  opposed  POW  roll  versus  the 
Horror’s POW to resist. No roll required if the target is dead 
already. May use the eyes of a possessed victim to attack others 
with Soul Burn.

chapter 15: scenariosAppendix I: Glossary

An alphabetical index of the key termi-
nology used in games of Call of Cthulhu.

1D100:  See  Percentage,  Percentile 
Dice.

1D4, 1D6; 1D8; 1D10, etc.: Notation 
used  to  indicate  a  number  and  type  of 
dice.

Adventure: See Scenario.

APP: Appearance, a Characteristic. See 
Characteristic.

Armor: Reduces the amount of damage 
received. May be worn (such as a bullet-
proof vest) or natural (such as the scaly 
hide of a monster). Deduct the number 
of  armor  points  from  the  damage;  the 
remaining  result  is  amount  of  actual 
damage subtracted from the character’s 
Hit Points (see page 33).

Assets:  Derived  from  Credit  Rating. 
Wealth that is tied up in assets can only 
be  spent  if  time  is  taken  to  realize  the 
capital (see page 46). 

Backstory: Aspects of the investigator 
that help to define their character. 

Base Chance: The chance an untrained 
investigator  has  to  successfully  use  a 
skill.  Some  skills  cannot  be  picked  up 
quickly  by  untrained  characters  and 
thus  have  a  1%  base  chance.  Base 
chances are shown in brackets alongside 
each skill on the investigator sheet (see 
page 430).

Believer: It is possible to learn about the 
Cthulhu Mythos from secondary sourc-
es—such  as  tomes—yet  not  actually 
believe  in  the  Mythos.  However,  when 
a character encounters the Mythos first-
hand, all accumulated Cthulhu Mythos 
Skill points are immediately deducted as 
Sanity loss (see page 179).

Bonus  Die:  May  be  applied  by  the 
Keeper to a roll. Roll an additional "tens" 

percentile die alongside the usual pair of 
percentile  dice  when  making  a  skill  or 
characteristic roll. You are now rolling 3 
separate  dice;  one  "units"  die  and  two 
"tens" dice. Use the tens die that yields 
the better (lower) result (see page 91).

Bout of Madness: When going insane, 
an  investigator  initially  experiences  a 
bout  of  madness,  which  may  be  either 
"real  time"  or  "summary,"  dependent 
on the situation (see page 156).

Build:  A  measure  of  physical  size, 
strength  and  durability.  Used 
for 
animate  beings  and  inanimate  objects, 
allowing for an easy scale comparison. 

Campaign:  A  series  of  linked  scenario 
adventures in which the same group of 
investigators participate.

Characteristic: Eight characteristics are 
rolled  for  each  investigator—Strength 
(STR), Constitution (CON), Size (SIZ), 
Intelligence (INT), Power (POW), Dex-
terity  (DEX),  Appearance  (APP),  and 
Education (EDU). Other attributes such 
as  Sanity,  Magic  Points  and  Hit  Points 
are  derived  from  these  eight  core  char-
acteristics.  Characteristics  determine  a 
character’s fundamental capacities (see 
page 30).

Chase:  A  series  of  actions  within  de-
termined  locations  in  which  a  pursuit 
occurs.  Chases  may  take  place  on  foot 
or in vehicles (see page 132).

Cash: Derived from Credit Rating. Cash 
is readily available to the investigator to 
spend as and when they like (see page 
46).

Check: See Tick. 

Combined  Skill  Roll:  One  dice  roll  is 
made  and  compared  to  more  than  one 
skill. The Keeper may require success in 
one or all of the skills, depending on the 
situation (see page 55).

CON:  Constitution,  a  Characteristic. 
See Characteristic.

Consequence:  The  negative  outcome 
of  a  failed  Pushed  skill  roll  (see  page 
86).

Credit Rating: Determines the amount 
of  money  a  character  has  available  as 
either cash or assets. Also indicates the 
general  living  standards  a  person  can 
afford (see page 61).

Critical:  A  1D100  result  of  “01”  is 
always  a  success  and  the  best  result 
possible (see page 89).

Cthulhu:  (pronounced  “kuh-THOO-
loo”  in  Chaosiumese).  He  was  created 
in  tales  by  H.  P.  Lovecraft  and  since 
has  been  present  or  been  intimated  in 
stories by other authors. 

Cthulhu Mythos skill: A skill used to 
determine  a  character’s  knowledge  of 
the  true  gods,  entities,  monsters,  and 
fiendish  lore  of  the  cosmos  (see  page 
61). 

Damage:  Attacks  and  accidents  are 
said to “do damage”—that is, to create 
wounds  or  injuries.  Damage  values  are 
subtracted  from  hit  points  (see  page 
119).

Damage  Bonus  (DB):  Derived  by 
adding STR and SIZ together and refer-
encing  the  total  on  Table  1:  Damage 
Bonus (see page 33). 

Combat/Chase Round: An elastic unit 
of  game  time  against  which  character 
movement,  weapon  use  and  skill  use 
are  compared.  Characters’  actions  in  a 
round  are  resolved  in  DEX  rank  order, 
from highest to lowest (see page 138).

Death:  Death  occurs  when  First  Aid 
(and Medicine) has failed to keep alive 
a  character  who  has  sustained  a  major 
wound and whose hit points are at zero. 
Also,  if  an  amount  of  damage  greater 
than  the  character’s  maximum  hit 

386 

Call of Cthulhupoints is taken in one attack then death 
is inevitable (see page 123).

Deeper  Magic,  Deeper  Version:  A 
more  effective  variant  of  a  spell  (see 
page 242).

Delusion:  While  insane,  an  investiga-
tor  may  misperceive  or  be  subject  to 
hallucinations,  thus  the  player  may  be 
presented with false information by the 
Keeper. The player may test the situation 
with a Reality Check (see page 162).

Development Phase: See Investigator 
Development Phase.

DEX:  Dexterity,  a  Characteristic.  See 
Characteristic.

DEX Order: Used in combat and chas-
es.  Characters  act  on  their  turn  in  the 
DEX order (highest to lowest) (see page 
102).

Dice, Die (D): Denotes that a dice re-
sult is required to determine an outcome 
in the game. 

Difficulty  Level:  there  are  three  diffi-
cult  levels:  Regular,  Hard,  and  Extreme 
(see page 82).

Diving for Cover: A target that is aware 
of being fired upon may react by diving 
for  cover  (target  makes  a  Dodge  skill 
roll) (see page 113). 

Dodge:  A  skill  used  to  avoid  hand-to-
hand and firearms attacks (see page 63). 

Dying: A character is dying when their 
hit points are reduced to zero and they 
have  also  sustained  a  Major  Wound 
(see page 123). 

EDU:  Education,  a  Characteristic.  See 
Characteristic.

Fighting Maneuver: Any use of Fight-
ing skill with an aim other than simply 
inflicting  harm,  such  as  seizing  an 
opponent, disarming, unbalancing, etc. 
(see page 105).

First  Aid:  A  skill  that  when  used  can 
heal 1 hit point to an injured character 
or stabilize a dying character (see page 
65). See Healing.

Foreshadowing: When a roll is pushed, 
before  the  dice  are  rolled,  the  conse-
quence of failure may be foreshadowed 
by the Keeper—giving an indication of 
the dire result that may await the inves-
tigator  if  the  pushed  roll  is  failed  (see 
page 85).

Full  Study:  An  extended  study  of  a 
Mythos  Tome.  Numerous  full  studies 
may  be  undertaken  of  the  same  tome, 
with each study taking twice as long as 
the previous one (see page 174).

Fumble: A 1D100 result of 96–100 (if the 
number  required  to  pass  a  roll  is  below 
50),  or  100  (if  the  number  required  to 
pass a roll is 50 or above) is an automatic 
failure;  usually  the  most  catastrophic 
result possible (see page 89).

Goal:  What  the  player  aims  to  achieve 
with a successful skill roll (see pages  82 
and 194).

Half: One half of the skill or character-
istic on 1D100. Used for Hard difficulty 
level.

Handout: Documents or otherwise that 
the Keeper physically hands to the play-
ers. Usually some form of clue.

Hand-to-Hand:  A  fighting  mode  or 
a  weapon  attack  powered  by  muscle, 
such  as  a  punch  or  sword  swing  (see 
page 103).

Extreme Success: An Extreme success 
is a result equal to or below one-fifth of 
the skill or characteristic value (see page 
82). See Difficulty Level.

Hard  Success:  A  Hard  success  is  a 
result equal to or below one-half of the 
skill  or  characteristic  value  (see  page 
82). See Difficulty Level.

Healing: If an injured character has not 
sustained a major wound, the character 
recovers 1 hit point per day; otherwise a 
roll must be made—see Major Wound. 
First  Aid  and  Medicine  can  help  with 
healing.

Hit  Points  (HP):  The  total  of  a  char-
acter’s  CON  and  SIZ  characteristics 
divided  by  ten  (rounded  down).  Hit 
points are checked off to indicate injury 
(see page 65).

Hit  Point  Total:  The  total  number  of 
hit  points  a  character  has  when  in  full 
health.

Human  Limits:  A  player  may  not  roll 
to  affect  an  opponent  if  the  opposing 
characteristic exceeds that of the inves-
tigator by 100 or more (see page 88).

Idea  Roll:  Should  players  find  them-
selves at a loss for how to proceed, they 
may  make  an  Idea  roll  and  the  Keeper 
will  put  them  back  on  track  (see  page 
199).

Impale:  Greater  damage  is  inflicted  if 
the successful attacker gains an Extreme 
level  of  success  in  their  attack—the 
penetrating  weapon  or  bullet  chanced 
to strike a vital area (see page 103).

Insanity,  Indefinite:  Occurs  when  an 
investigator  loses  one-fifth  or  more  of 
current  Sanity  points  in  one  game  day 
and lasts until the character is cured or 
recovers (see page 156).

Insanity, Permanent: If current Sanity 
points  reach  zero,  the  investigator  is 
completely insane (perhaps permanent-
ly  institutionalized)  and  is  removed 
from play (see page 156).

Insanity, Temporary: When losing 5 or 
more  Sanity  points  because  of  a  single 
Sanity roll, the investigator has suffered 
emotional trauma. With a successful Idea 
roll,  the  investigator  fully  comprehends 
what has been seen and goes insane for 
1D10 hours (see page 155).

Fifth:  One-fifth  of  a  character’s  skill 
or  characteristic  on  1D100.  Used  for 
Extreme difficulty level.

Hazard:  A  location  in  a  chase  that  is 
likely to cause damage or delay, requir-
ing a skill roll.

INT:  Intelligence,  a  Characteristic.  See 
Characteristic,  also  Intelligence  roll 
(see page 31).

387 

chapter 16: APPENDICESInitial  Reading:  The  first  reading  of 
a  Mythos  tome.  Allows  an  overview 
of  the  book’s  contents,  granting  half 
Cthulhu Mythos skill gain. If the reader 
is a believer then Sanity points must be 
lost (see page 173).

Investigator: A player character.

Investigator  Development  Phase:  A 
period  in  the  game  when  players  may 
update  their  investigators  (roll  for  skill 
increases,  etc.)  Normally  occurs  at  the 
end of a gaming session or at the con-
clusion of a scenario (see page 94).

Keeper  of  Arcane  Lore:  The  person 
who runs the game. The Keeper knows 
the  secrets  of  the  plot,  describes  the 
situations  and  controls  non-player 
characters and monsters. The Keeper is 
the  final  arbiter  of  the  game  rules  and 
should  endeavor  to  maintain  balance 
and fairness in the game. 

Know  (EDU)  roll:  An  Education  roll, 
where  an  investigator's  education  and 
training  may  provide  additional  insight 
in certain situations.

Levels of Success: There are four Levels 
of  Success;  Fail,  Regular  Success,  Hard 
success, and Extreme success. Extreme 
beats Hard; Hard beats Regular; Regular 
beats Fail (see page 82). 

Luck:  A  measure  of  a  character’s  for-
tune  with  events  that  are  beyond  their 
control.

Luck roll: Used to determine the fate of 
circumstances external to the investiga-
tors (see page 90).

Madness: See Bout of Madness.

Magic  Points  (MP):  Magic  points 
represent  the  fluctuating  expression 
of  the  POW  characteristic.  Used  in 
casting spells, magic points are inherent 
to  humans  and  other 
intelligences. 
Reaching zero magic points, any further 
expenditure is deducted from hit points 
at the rate of one for one. Magic points 
regenerate  at  the  rate  of  one  per  hour 
(see page 176).

Major Wound: If damage from a single 
attack is equal to or greater than half of 
a  character’s  maximum  hit  points,  the 
character  has  suffered  a  major  wound. 
A  character  that  has  received  a  major 
wound may die if their current hit points 
are reduced to zero (see page 121). At 
the end of each week a dice roll is made 
for healing.

Maneuver: See Fighting Maneuver.

Maximum Sanity: Equal to 99–Cthul-
hu Mythos Skill (see page 155).

Medicine:  Heals  1D3  hit  points  to  an 
injured or sick character, or to stabilize 
a  dying  character  (see  page  120).  See 
Healing.

Melee Combat: See Hand-to-Hand.

Movement Rate (MOV): The number 
of meters or yards that a character can 
move with care in one round. If hurry-
ing,  a  character  might  travel  up  to  five 
times this amount (see page 33).

Mythos: See Cthulhu Mythos.

Mythos Rating: A measure of the depth 
of Cthulhu Mythos knowledge contained 
within each tome (see page 175).

NPC:  Non-Player  Character,  played  by 
the Keeper.

Obscure Clue: The Keeper may decide 
to withhold a clue if the players fail their 
Perception skill rolls (see page 203).

Obvious Clue: The Keeper may decide 
that  a  clue  is  essential  and  will  simply 
deliver it to a player (see page 202).

Occupation:  What  an 
does for a living.

investigator 

Opposed  Roll:  Both  sides  in  the  con-
test roll and compare levels of success; 
the  higher  level  of  success  wins  the 
contest (see page 90). 

Optional Rule: Such rules are available 
as  enhancements  or  alternatives  to  the 
standard  rules  and  may  be  used  at  the 
Keeper’s discretion. 

388 

Outnumbered: Once a character has ei-
ther fought back or dodged in the present 
combat round, all subsequent attacks on 
them are made with one bonus die. Char-
acters and monsters that have more than 
one attack per round may also dodge or 
fight  back  that  number  of  times  before 
the bonus die is applied (see page 108).

Penalty: May be applied by the Keeper to 
a roll. Roll an additional "tens" percentile 
die alongside the usual pair of percentile 
dice when making a skill or characteristic 
roll. You are now rolling 3 separate dice; 
one "units" die and two "tens" dice. Use 
the tens die that yields the worst (higher) 
result (see page 91).

Percentage,  Percentage  Dice:  Most 
die rolls in the game are 1D100 (percent-
age)  rolls.  Skills  and  characteristics  are 
expressed as percentages.

Perception,  Perception  Roll:  Encom-
passes  Spot  Hidden,  Psychology  and 
Listen skills. May also include Track.

Personal  Interest:  When  creating  an 
investigator,  the  player  can  spend  INT 
x 2 skill points among any desired skills 
(see page 36).

Point-Blank:  Firearms  attacks  made 
within  a  fifth  of  the  shooter’s  DEX  in 
feet gain a bonus die (see page 113).

POW:  Power,  a  Characteristic.  See 
Characteristic.

Profession: see Occupation.

Pushing, Push: Provides a player with 
the option of a second attempt at a skill 
roll if the player can justify the second 
attempt.  A  pushed  roll  always  carries 
a  more  dire  consequence  if  the  roll  is 
failed. Combat, Chase, Sanity, and Luck 
rolls  cannot  be  pushed  (see  page  84). 
See Foreshadowing. 

Reality Check: The player makes a Sanity 
roll to test for delusions (see page 162).

Regular  Damage:  The  result  of  any 
single attack that deals damage less than 
half the character’s maximum hit points in 
a single blow. A character cannot die as a 
result of regular damage (see page 119).

Call of CthulhuRegular Success: A Regular success is 
a result equal to or below the full skill or 
characteristic  value  (see  page  82).  See 
Difficulty Level.

points.  A  success  may  cost  nominal 
Sanity  points  or  none  at  all.  A  failure 
always  costs  more  and  leads  toward 
insanity (see page 154).

Round: See Combat / Chase Round.

Sanity:  Every  investigator  begins  the 
game  as  sane,  but  through  the  loss  of 
Sanity points may become temporarily, 
indefinitely or permanently insane. See 
Insanity.

Sanity (SAN) Loss: The amount (usu-
ally a dice roll) of sanity lost to a char-
acter  due  to  unnerving  and  terrifying 
experiences (such as seeing a monster) 
(see page 154).

Sanity Points (SAN): A rating of san-
ity  that  begins  as  equal  to  the  charac-
ter’s  POW.  This  number  can  fluctuate. 
Maximum Sanity points equal 99 minus 
whatever  percentiles  of  the  Cthulhu 
Mythos skill the investigator has. Sanity 
points can decline or increase; however 
they do not routinely regenerate.

Sanity  Roll:  A  1D100  roll.  A  success 
is  equal  to  or  less  than  current  Sanity 

Scenario:  An  organized  and  plotted 
narrative  devised  for  roleplaying,  one 
that  includes  the  sequence  of  events, 
character  statistics,  special  rules  and 
spells, and other descriptions which in-
vestigators may find useful, interesting, 
or evocative. May be originally devised 
and designed by the Keeper or part of a 
published scenario or source book.

SIZ: Size, a Characteristic. See Charac-
teristic.

Skill:  A  defined  body  of  knowledge, 
technique or physical ability, especially 
pertaining to investigators and the skills 
available to them. 

Skill Roll: A 1D100 roll. See Success.

Story: See Scenario.

STR:  Strength,  a  Characteristic.  See 
Characteristic.

Surprise: A sudden, unexpected attack 
that  may  surprise  the  opponent  (see 
page 106).

Tick: Investigators who successfully use 
a skill mark the box (“tick” or “check”) 
on the investigator sheet that is next to 
the  skill.  Roll  for  skill  improvement  in 
the  investigator  development  phase  of 
the game. Skills improve in 1D10-point 
increments. Cthulhu Mythos and Credit 
Rating cannot be ticked (see page 61).

Tome, Mythos Tome: A book contain-
ing knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos, 
usually conferring Cthulhu Mythos Skill 
points and spells.

Unconscious:  A  character  who  has 
received a major wound may fall uncon-
scious if they fail to roll equal to or under 
CON. The duration of unconsciousness 
is at the Keeper’s discretion. A success-
ful  First  Aid  or  Medicine  skill  roll  may 
return a character to consciousness (see 
page 123).

chapter 16: APPENDICESAppendix II: Converting to 7th Edition Rules

Converting Material from 
Previous Editions of Call of 
Cthulhu
If  you  are  accustomed  to  previous  editions  of  these  rules, 
you’ll notice some changes have been made in 7th Edition. 
These rules are intended to allow materials from all previous 
editions of Call of Cthulhu to be made compatible with 7th 
Edition using minimal effort. Some of these changes are dis-
cussed here with the intention of providing the reader with an 
understanding of the thinking behind them.

Converting Investigators
If players have existing investigators that they wish to convert 
for use with 7th Edition, follow these instructions. Given the 
limited  life-expectancy  of  the  average  investigator,  this  is 
unlikely to be much of a concern for many players!

Characteristics
The  decision  was  taken  to  unify  characteristics  and  skills; 
both are now on a comparable percentage scale. The inten-
tion is to make it easier to compare and make opposed rolls 
using a mixture of skills and characteristics.

The aim is for all of the math to be done when creating an 
investigator rather than in the middle of a game. You do not 
have to write all of the half and fifth values on the investigator 
sheet, however we’ve found that doing so speeds up play, es-
pecially when players are asked to make a roll and announce 
the level of success.

The decision was made to divorce Luck from POW since 
the latter is of great significance elsewhere in the game. For 
that reason Luck is now rolled randomly (3D6 x 5).

EDU is no longer the only characteristic used to generate 
Occupational  Skill  Points.  Some  characters  may  have  a  low 
level of education but be extremely proficient in some of the 
less academic skills. This also lends more value to APP in the 
game.

We considered the option of associating a characteristic 
with each skill (as with Dodge and DEX) but decided against 
this  approach.  The  idea  is  sound  enough:  it  makes  perfect 
sense for one’s base skill in Charm to be one-fifth of Appear-
ance, for example. We decided against this approach for three 
reasons:

i Using characteristic values introduces additional work 

during investigator creation.

i One-fifth of a characteristic will be between 3 and 18. 
If it is a skill in which you are likely to spend points, 
the  benefit  of  using  one-fifth  of  the  characteristic 
did not seem significant enough to justify the added 
complication.

i  The characteristics feed into skill points to a limited 
degree.  A  variety  of  characteristics  are  used  to  cal-
culate skill points, depending on your investigator’s 
chosen occupation.

We chose to keep the link between Dodge and DEX, since 

it has always been that way.

characteristics  (see  note  following)  of  previous  editions 
now provide the one-fifth values. Multiply these by five for 
the full values and divide this new value by two, rounding 
down, for the one-half value. 

Luck points and hit points may be left unchanged. The 
SAN characteristic served only to set starting Sanity points 
and is no longer recorded as a characteristic.

Education  (EDU)  scores  higher  than  18  required  addi-

tional modification, as per Table XVI: EDU Conversion.

Age
Previous editions contained rules for aging and, while these 
vary a little from 7th Edition rules, there is no need to redo 
the  effects  of  age.  Damage  bonus  will  remain  unaltered, 
however  the  movement  rate  (see  Movement  Rate,  page 
33)  should  be  checked  and  Build  should  be  added  (see 
Damage Bonus and Build, page 33).

Damage Bonus
Lower damage bonuses have been changed in 7th Edition.

Hit Points
In 7th Edition, hit points are derived by adding CON + SIZ and di-
viding by 10, rounding down. Thus, a cultist with CON 60 + SIZ 
65 totals 125 divided by 10, yielding 12.5. He has 12 hit points.

In earlier editions, hit points were the average of CON + 
SIZ, rounded up. The same cultist would have CON 12 + SIZ 
13, averaged to 12.5 and rounded up to 13 hit points.

Thus, some enemies and non-player characters may have 
1 hit point fewer in 7th Edition than in previous editions. It 
is  recommended  that  the  Keeper  ignore  this  difference  for 
monsters and enemies.

Build 
7th Edition introduces Build, which is used when determining 
fighting maneuvers and also chases, and is derived from STR 
and SIZ (see Damage Bonus and Build, page 33).

Movement Rate 
In 6th Edition, all human movement rates are the same (8), 
whereas 7th Edition introduces scaled movement values (see 
Movement Rate, page 33). It is recommended (for simplici-
ty) that the Keeper uses the movement values as given when 
using material written for previous editions.

Many  of  the  skills  remain  unchanged  and  the  values  can 
simply  be  transferred  to  the  7th  Edition  investigator  sheet. 
Where points were spent in a skill that no longer exists, these 
points should be recorded in a Skill Pool for later distribution. 
When adding points to the skill pool, take care not to include 
the Base Values (note that some base values have changed 
between editions). 

This  pool  is  redistributed  among  the  7th  Edition  skills 
with the aim of creating a similar character. When distributing 
the skill pool, consider spending points in the new 7th Edition 
skills, especially Charm and Intimidate.

Some skills from previous editions have been amalgamated. 
This was done where a skill in one area would clearly confer 
a higher level of skill in a related area, such as with rifle and 
shotgun. The two weapons are different in many respects, but 
someone  who  is  proficient  with  a  shotgun  will  have  a  great 
advantage over an untrained person when using a rifle. 

Rifle and Shotgun were previously two separate skills, 
but have now been amalgamated. 6th Edition Archie 
has  Rifle  40%  and  Shotgun  70%.  The  6th  Edition 
base  values  were  Rifle  25%  and  Shotgun  30%.  Ar-
chie’s Rifle skill has been raised by 15%, his shotgun 
skill by 40%. 

The base value for Archie’s 7th Edition skill Fire-
arms  (Rifle/Shotgun)  is  25%,  to  which  is  added  the 
greater  of  the  two  values  (40%)  to  give  a  Firearms 
(Rifle/Shotgun)  skill  of  65%. The  15%  that  was  left 
unused is added to Archie’s Skill Pool.

chapter 16: APPENDICESAny  skill  points  that  have  been  pooled  as  a  result  of 
amalgamated or removed skills should now be distributed as 
the player sees fit. The Keeper may wish to enforce a cap of 
75% on starting skills. 

With the Keeper’s permission, some points may be trans-
ferred between skills to adjust or balance an investigator if 
required.

A complete list of skills and their new titles appears nearby.

Credit Rating
If your character already has a recorded value for their wealth, 
this may remain unchanged. Otherwise, figure your investi-
gator’s  wealth  according  to  their  Credit  Rating  score—see 
Cash and Assets, page 46.

Combat Skills (Kick, Punch, Head 
Butt, Grapple, Knife, and Club)
Each unarmed attack had its own individual skill in previous 
editions.  These  have  now  been  amalgamated  into  one  skill: 
Fighting (Brawl). If your investigator is up close with some-
one, a head-butt might be the most appropriate form of attack. 
If the target is on the ground, a kick might be more fitting. The 
player is encouraged to choose a form of attack that fits the 
situation rather than tactically using their highest skill.

Basic  weapons,  such  as  clubs  and  knives,  are  now  in-
cluded  in  the  Fighting  (Brawl)  skill.  If  your  investigator  is 
attacked,  he  or  she  may  grab  a  kitchen  knife  in  preference 
to being unarmed, but would they do so if it meant using a 
lower skill value? A skilled fighter is likely to be able to put 
any knife or club to good use.

Converting Non-Player 
Characters, Gods, Beasts 
and Monsters
Human NPCs that are fully detailed may be converted using 
the same rules as for investigators (above). Usually NPCs are 
less detailed than investigators and may be converted using 
the guidelines for monsters.

Characteristics: Characteristic scores from previous editions 
are simply multiplied by five to provide 7th Edition values. 
Since characteristics for NPCs and monsters are mostly used 
for setting the difficulty level for players’ skill rolls, there is no 
need to record the half and fifth values.

Skills: Most NPCs and monsters have only a limited number 
of  skills  listed,  which  for  the  most  part  can  remain  for  7th 
Edition use. If the character has skills no longer used in 7th 
Edition then assign the value to a comparable skill. 

Fighting skill: Many beings have multiple attack values listed 
and, for the most part, these should be amalgamated into one 
Fighting skill. Review the listed attacks and use the highest 
for the creature’s Fighting skill. Punch is the only exception to

this, since it previously began at 50% in the case of human 
NPCs, so reduce their punch skill by 25% to create balance.

Number  of  attacks  per  round:  Review  the  monster’s  de-
scription and figure how many attacks it may make per round, 
and  if  any  of  its  attacks  are  limited  in  the  number  of  times 
they may be used in a single round.

Other forms of attack: Many monsters have unique forms of 
attack. Where possible try to encompass these attacks, such as 

392 

Call of Cthulhuclaws or tentacles, under the umbrella skill of Fighting, adding 
some  notes  on  how  to  narrate  the  attacks.  If  the  attack  does 
something other than simply causing damage, create a Fighting 
Maneuver that replicates the effects of the attack. If the effect is 
simply to grab or knock an opponent to the floor, this can simply 
be performed with a maneuver (see Fighting Maneuvers, page 
105) using the creature’s basic Fighting skill. Take care to multiply 
any effects to characteristics by 5, and if need be, substituting a 
dice combination that approximates the new range of effect.

Other  characteristics:  The  monster’s  damage  bonus,  hit 
points, armor, and MOV remain unchanged.

Converting Scenarios
One of the great virtues for many players of Call of Cthulhu 
is the wealth of published scenarios and campaigns that have 
been published over the years. All of these can be used with 
the  new  7th  Edition  Call  of  Cthulhu  rules  with  only  a  few 
minor rules modifications.

Idea Rolls
It  is  important  to  note  the  difference  between  Intelligence 
rolls and Idea rolls in Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition.

Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath. To begin with, its average characteristics in 6th Edition are multiplied by 5. Where two 
values are listed (shown in brackets below) the Keeper may choose to take either the average or the higher one at his or her 
discretion.

7th Ed.
STR 220 
CON 82  
SIZ 220 
DEX 82
INT 70 
POW 90  

The dark young has the following attacks listed in 6th Edition.

ATTACKS & SPECIAL EFFECTS: In its masses of tentacles, a typical dark young has four thicker sinuous tentacles with 
which it attacks. Each of these thicker tentacles can strike out to injure or to grab and capture once per round, conceivably 
at four different targets. If a victim is grabbed, he or she is held to one of the horrible sucking mouths and drained of 1D3 
STR per round. This STR loss cannot be restored. While being drained, a victim is capable only of ineffectual writhing and 
screaming. The dark young can also trample with its massive hooves, typically hooting and bellowing as it does.

Weapons: Tentacle 80%, damage DB + STR drain
Trample 40%, damage 2D6 + DB
For 7th Edition these are altered as follows. First a number of attacks per round is figured. The text informs us that the 

dark young can attack 4 times with its tentacles and once with its hooves, thus it has 5 attacks per round:
Attacks per round: 5. It may only use its Trample attack once per round.

Then the creature’s basic Fighting attack is figured. Its most common attack is tentacle, so this value is used, setting its 
Fighting attack to 80%. Advice is offered on how to describe the attacks, centering around, but not limited to, the use of the 
tentacles. The Keeper may use the tentacles every time, but may feel this is repetitive and may prefer to use kicks or describe 
the dark young’s bulk simply crushing opponents. 

A key feature of the dark young’s attacks is that it can grab investigators with its tentacles. This can be done using a 
fighting maneuver and the use of its Fighting skill, so there is no need for an additional skill to accommodate this. The 
effect on STR of the strength drain is multiplied by 5; 1D3 gives a range of 1 to 3, multiplied by 5 would give a range of 5 
to 15, so this is set to 1D10+5. 
Fighting attacks: In its masses of tentacles, a typical dark young has four thicker sinuous tentacles with which it attacks. 
Each of these thicker tentacles can strike out to injure. It may also kick out with its hooves or simply crush or strike with 
its massive bulk.
Grab (fighting maneuver): The dark young can use its tentacles to grab and capture up to four victims. If a victim is 
grabbed, he or she is held to one of the horrible sucking mouths and drained of 1D10+5 STR per round. This STR loss 
cannot be restored. While being drained, a victim is capable only of ineffectual writhing and screaming. 
Trample: The dark young can also trample with its massive hooves, typically hooting and bellowing as it rears up then 
attempts to trample as many opponents as it can (up to 1D4 humans if they are situated close together).
Fighting 80% (40/16), damage bonus
Grab (fighting maneuver) grabbed and held for 1D10 + 5 STR drain per round 
Trample 40% (20/8), damage 2D6 + damage bonus

chapter 16: APPENDICES 
The Idea roll was commonly used to put the players back 
on  track  in  older  scenarios.  Two  aspects  of  the  7th  Edition 
rules come into play here. First, remember not to ask for rolls 
to uncover clues that you want to players to find (see Obvi-
ous Clues, page 202). Secondly, the new Idea roll (see page 
199) has a far more significant effect on play than in previous 
editions and should only be used occasionally.

G  An  Intelligence  (INT)  roll  may  be  called  for  by  the 
Keeper when an investigator is attempting to solve an 
intellectual puzzle of some kind. 

G  An Idea roll is made when the players have become 
stuck  at  a  point  in  the  investigation;  perhaps  they 
have missed a vital clue, or just don’t know what to 
do next and the game has stalled. The Idea roll allows 
the Keeper to get the investigation back on track.

Skill Modifiers
Where small skill modifiers (of +5 or less) are listed these may 
be ignored. 

To  approximate  this,  assume  that  a  bonus  die  means  a 

+20% chance, and that a penalty die means a –20% chance.
If a listed modifier seems significant to the Keeper, con-
sider either changing the difficulty level or applying a penalty 
or  bonus  die  depending  on  the  situation.  This  may  cause 
some skill rolls to become less likely to succeed, but players 
now have the option to push the roll.

An entry in the scenario "Tatters of the King" reads, “If 
the interview is handled well and the interviewer can 
either provide some proof of their professional interest 
in the university and in the expedition, or they succeed 
in a Fast Talk roll (–10 percentiles if they are operating 
through an interpreter), Bacci is very helpful.” 

Rather than adjusting the skill roll by 10 percen-
tiles, the Keeper should increase the level of difficulty 
from Regular to Hard if the investigators are operating 
through an interpreter. 

Social Interaction
Where calls for Fast Talk, Bargain, or Persuade are called for, 
consider if Intimidate or Charm might also be options. This is 
often obvious from the context, but be prepared to be flexible 
if your players use one of the new skills in a way you were 
not expecting.

Using the example above, one of the players seeks to 
Intimidate Bacci in his office, drawing a gun and yell-
ing demands at him in Italian. The Keeper refers to 
Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate, and Persuade Skills: 
Difficulty Levels (see page 93). No skill values are list-
ed for Bacci; he’s an academic and the Keeper decides 
that Bacci would not possess Intimidate or Psychology 
skill in excess of 50%, and so sets the difficulty level to 
Regular. Bacci is not inclined to divulge details of the 
expedition  to  just  anyone,  but  neither  is  he  strongly 
motivated to keep it secret. The investigator is waving 
a gun in Bacci’s face, so the difficulty level should be 
made easier. The Keeper rules that the player will suc-
ceed unless the Intimidate roll is fumbled. The player 
fumbles their Intimidate roll. Bacci calls for help and 
attempts to grab the investigator’s gun. A scuffle has 
broken out and the Keeper switches to combat rounds.

Characteristic Rolls
Where characteristic rolls are called for you, should use the 
following guide.

G  Characteristic x 1 (e.g. POW x 1, STR x 1): use Ex-
treme difficulty level (one-fifth of characteristic).
G  Characteristic x 2 or x 3 (e.g. POW x 2, STR x 3): use 

Hard difficulty level (half of characteristic).

G  Characteristic x 4 or x 5 or x 6 (e.g. POW x 4, STR x 
5): use Regular difficulty level (full characteristic).
G  Characteristic x 7 or x 8 (e.g. POW x 7, STR x 8): use 
Regular  difficulty  level  (full  characteristic)  with  one 
bonus die.

Opposed Rolls and the Resistance 
Table
7th Edition does not use the Resistance Table from previous 
editions.  Instead,  opposed  rolls  are  made.  Each  opposing 
party  makes  a  roll  under  the  required  skill  or  characteristic, 
aiming to roll under their own value while achieving a higher 
degree of success than the opposing value.

For 6th Edition and earlier, for any mention of a Resistance 
roll  or  the  Resistance  Table,  use  an  opposed  roll  instead. 
Thus, making a Resistance Table roll against STR 16 is now 
opposing a STR of 80. Opposing a sorcerer's POW 18 on the 
Resistance Table is now an opposed roll against POW 90.

Pushing Skill Rolls
This  will  not  be  mentioned  in  publications  that  pre-date 
7th Edition. Often a scenario may include a consequence of 
failing a skill roll. The Keeper should consider whether such a 
complication should occur immediately or be reserved as the 
consequence of failing a pushed roll. 

Poison Potency
In  earlier  versions  of  Call  of  Cthulhu,  each  poison  had  a 
Potency  (POT)  value.  The  higher  the  POT  value,  the  more 
deadly  the  poison.  Use  this  reckoner  to  convert  old  POT 
values to the poison bands.

394 

Call of CthulhuPOT

Tomes
Each tome has a value that denotes the number of Cthulhu 
Mythos  skill  points  that  are  gained  when  a  character  reads 
the book. In 7th Edition, the total amount of Cthulhu Mythos 
points  remains  unchanged,  but  is  divided  into  two  values: 
Cthulhu Mythos Initial (CMI) for an initial reading of the book 
(akin to “skim reading”), and Cthulhu Mythos Full (CMF) for 
a proper, full reading and study of the text. 

To  figure  the  two  values,  simply  divide  the  6th  Edition 
Cthulhu Mythos value of the tome by three and round down; 
this  is  the  amount  of  points  gained  for  an  initial  reading 
(CMI). The remainder of the points are those gained for a full 
study reading (CMF).

In  6th  Edition,  the  Eltdown  Shards  has  a  Cthulhu 
Mythos  +11%.  Divided  by  three,  this  gives  a  value 
+3%  for  the  initial  reading,  and  +8%  for  the  full 
study (+3%/+8%).

Conclusion
Call of Cthulhu was created over 30 years ago by Sandy Pe-
tersen. There have been very few changes in those 30 years. 
The aim of this new edition is to retain the aspects that made 
Call  of  Cthulhu  so  much  fun  to  play  and  at  the  same  time 
introduce some new rules that provide the Keeper and players 
with additional ways to create drama and excitement, such as 
the ability to push rolls and run chase scenes. 
We hope that you enjoy this new edition.

Key
Acronyms:

G  (HG): Handgun
G  (R/S): Rifle/Shotgun
G  (SMG): Submachine Gun
G  (MG): Machine Gun

Skill: Skill required to use the weapon.

Damage:  Roll  the  dice  indicated  to  determine  weapon’s 
damage.  When  an  Extreme  success  is  achieved  with  an 
attack roll the damage is increased. For the purpose of de-
termining  increased  damage  weapons  are  divided  into  two 
groups: impaling and non-impaling. Non-impaling weapons 
deliver maximum damage (plus maximum damage bonus if 
applicable). It is important to note that only those initiating 
an attack deal greater damage with an Extreme success; any 
successful  attacks  made  as  a  result  of  fighting  back  do  not 

deal increased damage, even on an Extreme success.

(i): Indicates a weapon category or specific weapon which can 
impale.  On  an  Extreme  level  of  success  an  impale  has  been 
inflicted: maximum damage (plus maximum damage bonus 
for  melee  weapons)  and  add  a  damage  roll  for  the  weapon. 
Impales  are  not  applied  as  a  result  of  fighting  back. At  very 
long range, when only an Extreme success will hit the target, 
an impale only occurs with a critical hit (a roll of "01").

Base Range: Standard distance of weapon’s attack. 

Uses per Round: Number of attacks that can be initiated per 
combat round (does not affect number of times a character 
may fight back with a melee weapon). Most firearms may fire 
one bullet without penalty; more bullets up to the maximum 
(shown by the number in brackets) may be fired, but each 
shot is taken with a penalty die. Some weapons have burst or 
full auto capability, when using this, use the automatic fire 
rules. 

405 

chapter 16: APPENDICESExplosives, Heavy Weapons, Misc. (i)Bullets in Gun (Magazine): There may be multiple options 
depending on the size of magazine or drum used.

Claymore Mine: The weapon has a cone of fire; allow nom-
inal 120-degree effect.

Cost: Split by 1920s / modern era (modern-day prices reflect 
collectors’ market, 1920s prices do not).

Col. Moran’s Air Rifle: Uses compressed air rather than ex-
plosive propellant, achieving relatively silent operation.

Common in Era: Denotes availability by era. 

Malfunction (Mal): If die roll result equal to or higher than 
the  firing  weapon’s  malfunction  number,  the  shooter  does 
not merely miss—the weapon does not fire.

Rare:  Perhaps  obsolete;  a  fine  specimen  for  collectors  or 
perhaps illegal. 

+DB: Plus damage bonus, which varies by individual. 

Stun: Target may not act for 1D6 rounds (or as the Keeper 
indicates).

Burn: Target must roll Luck to avoid catching on fire. Take 
minimum  damage  on  following  round.  Double  this  each 
round until extinguished (providing target is flammable).

Burst/Full Auto: Some automatic weapons can be switched 
to fire burst or full auto; such firearms are usually unavailable 
to civilians; prices reflect black-market.

1B, 2B: 1 barrel, 2 barrels.

1/2, 1/3: Can be accurately fired every second or third round.

1 or 2: One or two barrels fireable in same round.

N/A:  Generally  not  commercially  available  (in  auto-fire 
configuration or at all). 

2 yards, 3 yards, etc.: Damage radius of explosion in yards; at 
up to double the range, the damage is halved. At up to triple 
the range, the damage is quartered. Beyond that damage is 
ignored.

* SEE NOTE BELOW: 

Assault Rifle: Use Rifle/Shotgun skill when firing single shot; 
use Submachine skill when firing burst or full auto.

Chainsaw:  Very  awkward  to  use  as  a  weapon;  double  the 
user’s chance of a fumble. Chainsaw fumbles are horrible and 
cause 2D8 harm to the user as the chainsaw is likely to buck up 
towards to user’s head or shoulder, or cut down towards their 
legs or feet. Alternatively the chain can break and connect with 
the user’s body (2D8 damage). A malfunction causes the en-
gine to stall or the chain to jam or become displaced. A major 
wound from a chainsaw severs a random limb.

Dynamite  stick  and  Hand  grenade:  Each  delivers  4D10 
damage to those within 3 yards, 2D10 to those within 6 yards 
and 1D10 to those within 9 yards.

Garrote: Requires the victim to make a Fighting Maneuver 
to  escape  or  suffer  1D6  damage  per  round.  Effective  only 
again human (or similar) opponents.

GE  Mini-Gun:  Gatling  style  heavy  machine  gun,  often 
mounted in helicopters. Hand-firing such a weapon without 
a mount takes minimum Build 2.

Handguns: If firing more than one shot per round all rolls 
are made with one penalty die. Number in brackets denotes 
maximum number of shots that may be fired in one round. 

LAW: Light Antitank Weapon, disposable. 

Mace spray: Do not use the point-blank range rule for this 
weapon. The target should roll one-fifth or less of their DEX 
on 1D100 to avoid being temporarily blinded. Effective only 
against human (or similar) opponents.

Rifles:  Most  rifles  except  .45  Martini-Henry  Rifle  and  Col. 
Moran’s  Air  Rifle  fire  1  shot  per  round.  Reloading  is  what 
takes the time, not chambering the round. Assault rifles have 
a fire selector allowing for single shots or 3-round burst or 
full automatic fire. 

Shotguns:  Do  three  levels  of  damage  depending  on  their 
range,  written  as  "short  range/medium  range/long  range." 
Rifles  and  handguns  can  impale,  however  shotguns,  which 
fire a mass of smaller shot, cannot impale (although a shot-
gun loaded with slugs instead of pellets could impale). This 
is not so say that shotguns are not deadly; an extreme level of 
success with a shotgun blast at close range will do 24 damage!

Shotgun solid slugs:  10-gauge  1D10+7,  12-gauge  1D10+6, 
16-gauge 1D10+5, 20-gauge 1D10+4; base ranges 50 yards. 
May impale.

Taser  (Contact  or  Dart):  Affects  only  targets  up  to  Build 
2,  stunned  targets  are  incapacitated  for  1D6  rounds  (or  as 
determined by the Keeper).

Call of CthulhuSummary of   
Game System 
Rules

Making Skill Rolls:

T  State a goal before rolling any dice. 
T  Determine the difficulty level for the roll.
T  Pushing the roll: can the player justify it? Keeper may 

foreshadow consequence of failure.
T  Check skills when used successfully.

Critical success: 01.

Fumble: 100 is always a fumble. If the dice roll required for 
success is below 50, a fumble occurs if 96—100 is rolled.

Regular  Difficulty  Level:  Opposing  skill/characteristic  is 
below 50, or the task is a standard one. The player needs to roll 
equal to or below his or her full skill or characteristic to succeed.

Hard Difficulty Level: Opposing skill/characteristic is equal 
to  or  above  50,  or  the  task  is  exceptionally  difficult.  The 
player needs to roll equal to or below half his or her skill or 
characteristic to succeed.

Extreme  Difficulty  Level:  Opposing  skill/characteristic  is 
equal to or above 90, or this task is on the borders of human 
capability. The player needs to roll equal to or below a fifth of 
his or her skill or characteristic to succeed.

Opposed Rolls
Use  when  two  players  are  opposing  one  another.  Both  roll 
against  agreed  skill  or  characteristic.  The  one  with  the  best 
level of success wins:

A Critical success beats an Extreme success.

An Extreme success beats a Hard success.

A Hard success beats a Regular success.

A Regular success beats a Failure or Fumble.

In the case of a tie, the side with the higher skill (or character-
istic) wins. If still tied either an impasse has been reached or 
both sides should re-roll.

Opposed rolls cannot be pushed.

Bonus Dice and Penalty Dice
For  each  bonus  die:  roll  an  additional  tens  percentile  die 
alongside the usual pair of percentile dice when making a skill 
roll (rolling 3 separate dice: one units die and two tens dice). 
Use the tens dice that yields the better (lower) result. 
For  each  penalty  die:  roll  an  additional  tens  percentage  die 
alongside the usual pair of percentage dice (rolling 3 separate 
dice: one units die and two tens dice). Use the tens dice that 
yields the worse (higher) result. 

Human Limits and Skill Rolls
The upper limit of what can be opposed is 100 + the investi-
gator’s skill or characteristic.

Starting with the lowest, deduct each investigator’s char-
acteristic  value  in  turn  from  the  opposition’s  characteristic. 
Continue  doing  this  until  the  opponent’s  characteristic  has 
been reduced to a value that can be challenged by an inves-
tigator. Investigators whose characteristics were not used to 
reduce the opposing factor may now make a skill roll, with 
an  Extreme,  Hard  or  Regular  difficulty  level,  as  determined 
by the value of the opposing characteristic. The opposition 
cannot be reduced to zero or lower by this method; a skill roll 
is always required.

Combined Skill Rolls
Used  when  a  situation  allows  or  demands  the  use  of  more 
than one skill. 

Only one dice roll is made; the result is then compared 
with each of the skills named. The Keeper will specify whether 
a success is required for both skills, or if only one of the skills 
need be successful.

Investigator Development 

Phase

T  Roll  1D100  for  each  skill  checked.  If  the  result  is 
higher than the skill or over 95, add 1D10 skill points.

T  Erase ticks.
T  If an increase raises a skill to 90% or more, add 2D6 

Sanity points.

T  Check Credit Rating and review finances (see Inves-
tigator  Development  Phase:  Employment  and 
Credit Rating).

T  Seek to recover Sanity (see Chapter 7: Sanity).
T  Review  the  investigator’s  background  (see  Altering 

an Investigator’s Background, page 95).

407 

chapter 16: APPENDICESSummary of  
Melee Combat

1. Establish the order of attack: Rank all characters in DEX 
order—highest goes first.

Surprise attacks: Allow a skill roll to determine whether 
the target anticipates the attack (Spot Hidden, Listen, Psychol-
ogy).  If  successful,  switch  to  the  usual  DEX  combat  order. 
Otherwise the attack automatically hits or gains a bonus die.

2. Each character gets one action: Any action a character can 
make  in  a  combat  round—attacking,  dodging,  fighting  back, 
fleeing,  casting  a  spell,  etc.  Note:  some  NPCs  and  monsters 
have multiple actions.

3. Determine the intention of the action: Is the intention to 
cause damage, dodge or perform a maneuver?

4. The target of an attack may fight back, dodge the at-
tack or attempt a maneuver of their own.

5. Both sides make a skill roll.

If the character chooses to fight back, use the target’s Fight-

ing skill to oppose the attacker’s Fighting skill. 

If the character chooses to dodge, use the target’s Dodge 

skill to oppose the attacker’s Fighting skill.

If the target is neither fighting back nor dodging, refer to 

Striking the first blow (Surprise Attacks) on page 106.

6. Determine who was successful. 

a)  Attacking  a  target  that  is  fighting  back:  The  side  with 
the  better  level  of  success  avoids  being  harmed,  and  inflicts 
damage on the opponent. In a draw the character initiating the 
attack beats the character that is fighting back. If both fail, no 
damage is inflicted.

b) Attacking a target that is dodging: If the attacker gains a 
higher level of success, the attack is successful and the attacker 
inflicts  damage  on  the  loser.  Otherwise  the  attack  is  dodged 
and no damage is dealt. In a draw the character dodging wins 
and evades the attack. If both fail, no damage is inflicted.

Combat rolls cannot be pushed.

7.  Roll  damage  for  successful  attacks  (see  Table  XVII: 
Weapons, page 401-406, or 1D3 for unarmed human attack). 
If the attacker gains an Extreme level of success (not if fighting 
back) greater damage is inflicted:

If  the  attacker  is  using  an  impaling  weapon:  maximum 
damage  (maximum  damage  plus  maximum  damage  bonus) 
plus roll weapon damage. 

If  the  attacker  is  using  a  non-impaling  weapon  (e.g. 
blunt): maximum damage (maximum damage plus maximum 
damage bonus).

Summary of  
Fighting Maneuvers

If the goal is something other than simply inflicting physical 
harm (e.g. disarm), resolve it with a maneuver.

1. Compare Builds of the character performing the ma-
neuver and the target: If attacker is smaller then they take 1 
penalty die for each point of difference in Build. If difference 
is 3 or more, the maneuver is impossible.

2. Make the attack roll: Same as for a regular Fighting attack 
(Brawling  or  appropriate  fighting  specialization  skill).  The 
opponent should choose to either dodge or fight back as they 
would for a normal attack:

G  If the target is dodging: Roll Fighting skill vs. Dodge 
skill.  If  the  character  performing  the  maneuver 
achieves a higher level of success than the character 
dodging,  the  maneuver  is  successful  (if  tied,  the 
target is able to dodge the maneuver).

G  If  the  target  is  fighting  back:  Roll  Fighting  skill  vs. 
Fighting skill. If the character fighting back achieves 
a higher level of success, the maneuver fails and the 
opponent inflicts damage on the character performing 
the maneuver (if tied, the maneuver is successful). 
G  The target of an attack may use a maneuver of their 
own: Resolve as for fighting back, but apply the effect 
of their maneuver instead of inflicting damage.

3. A successful maneuver allows the character to achieve 
one goal (page 105).

Other Combat Situations

Outnumbered
Once  a  character  has  either  fought  back  or  dodged  once  in 
the present combat round, all subsequent attacks on them are 
made with one bonus die.

Characters and monsters that have more than one attack 
per round may also dodge or fight back that number of times 
before the bonus die is applied. Note that some Mythos enti-
ties can never be outnumbered by investigators.

Ranged and Thrown Attacks 
Ranged missile attacks (such as bows) are treated like firearms 
(target has the option of Diving for Cover, see page 113).

Thrown weapons may be opposed with the Dodge skill in 
the  same  way  as  Fighting  attacks  (see  Resolving  a  Fighting 
Attack Made Against a Target that is Dodging, page 103).

408 

Call of CthulhuA  character  may  not  choose  the  option  of  fighting  back 
against a ranged (missile) or thrown weapon attack unless he 
or she is already within close physical proximity to the attacker 
(within a fifth of their DEX in feet).

Half  the  attacker’s  damage  bonus  is  applied  to  thrown 
weapons  and  missile  weapons  which  rely  directly  on  the 
user’s strength. Thus this applies to bows and slings but not 
to crossbows.

To resolve a ranged or thrown attack, the Keeper should set 
a difficulty level as for a firearm attack (see Firearms Difficulty 
Levels, page 112).

Escaping Close Combat
On  their  turn  in  the  order  of  combat,  providing  a  character 
has  an  escape  route  and  is  not  physically  restrained,  their 
action can be used to flee melee combat. 

Armor 
Armor  reduces  the  damage  received:  deduct  the  number  of 
armor points from the damage.

Summary of  
Firearms Combat

To resolve a firearms attack, make a 1D100 roll and compare 
the result with the attacker’s Firearms skill (using the appro-
priate specialization). The firearms roll is not opposed. The 
difficulty level is determined by the range, with various other 
factors granting either penalty or bonus dice. A failure never 
deals damage.

Readied Firearms: Shoot at DEX + 50.

Firearms Difficulty 
Levels

The difficulty level of a firearms skill roll is always set accord-
ing to range. 

G  Within base range: Regular difficulty level.
G  Long range (up to twice base range): Hard difficulty 

level.

G  Very  long  range  (up  to  four  times  base  range):  Ex-

treme difficulty level.

Any further modifiers use bonus or penalty dice.
Note: At very long range, when only an Extreme success 
will hit the target, an impale only occurs with a critical hit (a 
roll of 01).

Firearm modifiers

Once the difficulty level of a firearms attack has been set, all 
other factors that lend a distinct advantage or disadvantage 
are taken into account.

G  Target  is  diving  for  cover  (Dodge  roll  success):  one 

penalty die.

G  Target is partially concealed: one penalty die.
G  Point-blank  range  (within  fifth  DEX  in  feet):  one 

bonus die.

G  Aiming (for one round): one bonus die.
G  Fast-moving target (MOV 8+): one penalty die.
G  Target is small (Build –2): one penalty die.
G  Target is large (Build 4+): one bonus die.
G  Loading  1  bullet  and  shooting  in  same  round:  one 

penalty die.

G  Firing  2+  shots  from  a  handgun  in  one  round:  one 

penalty die on all shots.

G  Firing into melee: one penalty die.

Aiming: Must be declared on the character’s turn in the order 
of combat. The shot is taken on the same turn in the order of 
combat on the following round. If the aiming character takes 
damage or moves while aiming, the advantage of aiming is lost. 

Firing  into  melee  combat:  A  fumble  indicates  an  ally  has 
been hit. If multiple allies are in the line of fire, the one with 
the lowest Luck score is hit.

chapter 16: APPENDICES 
Reloading  Firearms:  One  combat  round 
to load two shells into any handgun, rifle 
or shotgun. Allow one round to exchange 
a clip. Allow two rounds to change a ma-
chine gun belt.

Full Auto/ 
Burst Fire

Player  declares  the  number  of  bullets  to 
be  fired  before  rolling  dice.  Full  auto  fire 
is  divided  into  a  number  of  volleys;  each 
volley requires a skill roll. Divide firer’s skill 
by  10  (round  down)  to  determine  how 
many bullets are in a volley (regardless of 
skill, a volley is never less than 3 bullets). 
The attacker must make a fresh attack roll 
for each volley of shots or whenever they 
select  a  new  target.  Burst  fire  is  a  single 
skill roll (a single volley).

Ammunition is expended when moving 
between targets (one bullet per meter/yard).

Rolling to Hit with Full Auto/Burst Fire:

First  attack  roll:  set  difficulty  by  range 
and then apply any modifiers.

Second  and  further  attack  rolls:  add 
one  penalty  die  (or  remove  a  bonus  die) 
for each additional attack roll. If this would 
incur  three  penalty  dice,  stick  with  two 
penalty  dice  and  raise  the  difficulty  level 
by one step.

G  If  the  attack  roll  is  successful:  half  of  the  shots 
fired hit the target—roll damage for half of the shots 
(round down, minimum of one). Subtract any armor 
from each shot.

G   If the attack is an Extreme success: all shots fired 
hit the target, the first half (round down, minimum of 
one) of which impale. Subtract any armor from each 
shot. As for all firearm attacks, if the difficulty level 
of the shot was Extreme, the best possible result is a 
successful hit and not an impale. 

Malfunctions: Any attack roll result equal to or higher than 
the  firing  weapon’s  malfunction  number  indicates  that  the 
weapon malfunctions and does not fire.

Other Forms of Damage

Injury

Damage

Examples

Minor: a person could survive 
numerous occurrences of this level 
of damage.

1D3

Punch, kick, head-butt, mild acid, breathing smoky atmosphere*, a 
thrown fist-size rock, falling (per 10 feet) onto soft swamp.

Moderate: might cause a major 
wound; it would take a few such 
attacks to kill.

1D6

Falling (per 10 feet) onto grass, club, strong acid, breathing water*, 
exposure to vacuum*, small caliber bullet, arrow,  
fire (burning torch).

Severe: likely to cause a major 
wound. One or two occurrences 
would render a person uncon-
scious or dead.

1D10

.38 caliber bullet, falling (per 10 feet) onto concrete, axe, fire 
(flamethrower, running through a burning room), being 6 to 9 
yards from an exploding hand grenade or stick of dynamite,  
a mild poison**.

Deadly: the average person has a 
50% chance of dying.

2D10

Hit by a car at 30mph, being 3 to 6 yards from an exploding hand 
grenade or stick of dynamite, a strong poison**.

Terminal: outright death is likely.

4D10

Hit by a speeding car, being within 3 yards of an exploding hand 
grenade or stick of dynamite, a lethal poison**.

Splat: outright death almost 
certain.

8D10

Being involved in a high-speed head-on collision,  
being hit by a train.

*Asphyxiation and drowning: a CON roll should be made each round; once a CON roll is failed, damage is sustained each 
round thereafter until death or until the victim is able to breathe. If the character is in a state of physical exertion, a Hard success 
is required on the CON roll.

**Poisons: a roll equal to or less than one-fifth of CON will halve damage from poisons. Poisons may cause a variety of 
additional  symptoms  including:  stomach  pains,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  chills,  sweats,  cramps,  jaundice,  altered  heart  rate, 
impaired vision, convulsions, unconsciousness and paralysis. It is up to the Keeper whether the symptoms permit the victim 
to act or not, or to act with a penalty die or an increased level of difficulty.

In certain circumstances, Keepers may allow a poison's effects to be shaken off if the CON roll is a critical success.

chapter 16: APPENDICESSummary of  
Chase Rules

Establishing the Chase

Decide  whether  fleeing  characters/vehicles  are  heading  in 
same  direction  or  splitting  up.  If  splitting  up,  decide  which 
pursuers  are  chasing  which  characters/vehicles.  If  you  have 
multiple groups, treat each one as a separate chase.

Speed roll: All participants make a skill roll: CON (if on foot 
or other self-propelled mode) or Drive Auto (for vehicles). 

G If passed: MOV remains unchanged. 
G If an Extreme success: MOV +1. 
G If failed: MOV –1.

Order each group separately in order of MOV.
Fleeing characters/vehicles with a speed greater than any 

of their pursuers may escape completely. 

Pursuers with a speed that is lower than the slowest flee-

ing character are completely out of the chase. 

Cut to the Chase 

Place the pursuers: Place pursuers in order, slowest at the 
rear, others a number of locations ahead equal to their differ-
ence in MOV.

Place  the  fleeing  characters:  Place  the  fleeing  characters/
vehicles in order, slowest at the rear (2 locations ahead of the 
lead  pursuer),  others  a  number  of  locations  ahead  equal  to 
their difference in MOV.

Position hazards and barriers.

Allocate  each  participant  a  number  of  movement  ac-
tions: Every character and vehicle gets one movement action 
by  default.  To  this  is  added  the  difference  between  their 
movement  rating  (MOV)  and  the  movement  rating  of  the 
slowest participant in the chase.

Determine DEX order

Hazards: Make a skill roll to move through a hazard. If the 
skill roll is failed, the Keeper may inflict damage (see Table III: 
Other Forms of Damage, page 124, or Table VI: Vehicular 
Collisions, page 147) and delay (1D3 movement actions).

Cautious  approach  to  hazards:  1  or  2  movement  actions 
may  be  spent  to  buy  1  or  2  bonus  dice  for  the  skill  roll  to 
negotiate a hazard.

Barrier: Either a barrier must be broken down or a skill roll 
must also be made before a character/vehicle can move onto 
the  next  location.  If  appropriate,  the  Keeper  may  wish  to 
inflict damage and delay as for a hazard.

Breaking  down  barriers:  Vehicles  inflict  1D10  damage  for 
each point of their Build. If a vehicle attacks a barrier and fails 
to destroy it, the vehicle is wrecked. If the barrier is destroyed, 
the  vehicle  suffers  an  amount  of  damage  equal  to  half  the 
barrier’s hit points prior to impact.

G Internal door or thin wooden fence: 5 hit points.
G Standard back door: 10 hit points.
G Strong domestic external door: 15 hit points.
G 9” brick wall: 25 hit points.
G Mature tree: 50 hit points.
G Concrete bridge support: 100 hit points.

Attacks:  Cost  1  movement  action  to  initiate  (except  if 
ranged). Resolve as regular combat. 

Vehicles in combat: Substitute Drive Auto for both Fighting 
and Dodge skills. A vehicle can be used as a weapon (1D10 
damage per listed build point). Whenever a vehicle is used to 
inflict damage it also suffers an amount of damage equal to 
half (round down) that which it delivers, but never enough 
to cause it to lose a greater amount of build points than the 
thing which it hit originally possessed. Each full 10 hit points 
of  damage  decreases  a  vehicle’s  build  by  one  point  (round 
down); damage below 10 points is ignored.

Random locations: Roll 1D100:
01-59 = 1 open location
60+ = 1 Regular hazard
85+ = 1 Hard hazard 
96+ = 1 Extreme hazard 

Environment is especially hazardous: add a penalty die.

Environment is unlikely to have any dangers or delays: 
add a bonus die.

Sudden hazards: Once per round there is the option to call 
for a group Luck roll. Winner (Keeper or players) gets to place 
a regular hazard where they wish. Keeper and players must 
alternate in who calls for a sudden hazard.

Pedal to the Metal
A driver can elect to move 2 or 3 locations 
with  one  movement  action.  Any  hazards 
encountered have one penalty die applied to 
the skill rolls.

A  driver  can  elect  to  move  4  or  5  lo-
cations  with  one  movement  action.  Any 
hazards encountered have two penalty dice 
applied to the skill rolls.

One passenger can assist the driver with 
navigation  and  spotting  ways  to  negotiate 
hazards. With a successful Spot Hidden or 
Navigate  roll,  on  the  vehicle’s  next  move, 
the vehicle can accelerate once with 1 fewer 
penalty die.

Firearms:  Penalty  die  while  moving.  No 
penalty  die  if  remaining  stationary  and 
spending 1 movement action.

Tires:  Penalty  die  to  target  tires.  Armor:3. 
Hit  points:  2  (only  damaged  by  impaling 
weapons). Destroying a tire reduces vehicle 
Build by 1.

Driver  damage:  If  the  driver  of  a  moving 
vehicle takes a major wound he or she may 
lose  control  of  their  vehicle  and  must  roll 
immediately as for a Hazard at Hard difficulty 
level.

Switching  between  being  running  and 
driving:  Make  a  fresh  speed  roll.  Recalcu-
late movement actions. 

Monsters in Chases
Where the monster or non-player character 
has  an  implied  aptitude,  use  their  DEX  in 
place of the skill.

Where  the  monster  or  non-player  char-
acter has an implied ineptitude, use one-fifth 
of their DEX in place of the skill (or simply 
rule the attempt to be an automatic failure).
the  monster  or  non-player 
character  has  neither  implied  aptitude  nor 
ineptitude, use half of their DEX in place of 
the skill.

Where 

If  other  skills  are  required,  the  Keeper 
might use a similar approach, using what he 
or she feels to be the most appropriate char-
acteristic from which to derive skill values.

Key
MOV:  A  rating  of  the  vehicle’s  speed  and  maneuverability 
in  chases.  These  ratings  are  for  modern  vehicles  and  may  be 
reduced by around 20% for 1920s vehicles (though there were 
cars in the 1920s that could exceed 100 MPH). 

Build: A rating of the strength and size of the vehicle. When 
reduced  to  zero,  the  vehicle  is  out  of  action.  Each  full  10  hit 
points of damage decreases a vehicle’s build by 1 point (round 
down); damage below 10 hit points is ignored.

If  a  vehicle’s  build  is  reduced  to  half  (round  down)  of  its 
starting value or lower, it is impaired; one penalty die is applied 
to all Drive Auto (or appropriate skill) rolls.

If a vehicle takes damage equal to its full build value in one 
incident,  the  vehicle  is  completely  wrecked  in  an  impressive 
manner. It may explode, burn, roll or suffer some combination 
thereof. All occupants of the vehicle are likely to die. Whether or 
not investigators have a chance of survival is up to the Keeper: 
Luck rolls may be allowed. Those who are fortunate get thrown 
free, though it is recommended they take at least 2D10 damage. 
If a vehicle’s build is otherwise reduced to zero by cumu-
lative  damage  (i.e.  in  increments  of  less  than  the  vehicle’s 
starting build value), it becomes undrivable, grinding to a halt. 
Depending on the situation (and perhaps a Luck roll) this may 
lead to an accident resulting in 1D10 damage for the driver and 
each passenger. 

Armor for people: The armor rating is for the passengers and 
driver,  reflecting  the  number  of  points  of  armor  the  vehicle 
provides against external attacks.

Call of CthulhuGetting Used to the Awfulness
The player records the cumulative Sanity points lost to a given 
Mythos entity (e.g. deep ones); the cumulative loss should 
not exceed the maximum amount for a single encounter with 
that  entity.  Lower  the  recorded  cumulative  loss  by  1  with 
each investigator development phase.

Summary of  
Sanity Rules

Failing a Sanity roll: one involuntary action.

Sanity loss of 5 points or more: make an Intelligence roll—
if successful, temporary insanity ensues.

Sanity  loss  of  one-fifth  or  more  in  one  day:  indefinite 
insanity ensues.

The Phases of Insanity

A  bout  of  madness:  either  "real  time"  (1D10  rounds)  or 
"summary"  (1D10  hours);  Keeper  amends  one  backstory 
detail (phobia, mania, etc.)
Underlying Insanity: any further Sanity loss results in an-
other bout of madness; the investigator is prone to delusions.

The Side-Effects of Insanity
1.  Phobias:  while  insane,  must  fight/flee  or  take  a  penalty 
die on skill rolls.
2.  Manias:  while  insane,  must  submit  to  mania  or  take  a 
penalty die on skill rolls.
3. Delusions and Reality Checks: make a Sanity roll to test 
for delusions:

Failure: lose 1 Sanity point (and undergo a bout of  
madness if insane).
Success: dismiss delusions.

4.  Insanity  and  the  Cthulhu  Mythos:  add  5%  Cthulhu 
Mythos  skill  with  first  bout  of  madness  inspired  by  a 
Mythos-related event. Add 1% on subsequent occasions.

Recovery
From temporary insanity: after 1D10 hours or a good rest.

From indefinite insanity: roll at the end of each month of 
treatment; Keeper may allow automatic recovery during the 
next investigator development phase.

Treatment with private/home care (roll 1D100 per month): 

01–95: success (or under psychoanalysis skill); add 1D3 San-
ity points. Make a Sanity roll—if successful, insanity is cured.
96–100: failure; lose 1D6 Sanity points.

Treatment at institution (roll 1D100 per month): 

01–50: success (or under Psychoanalysis skill); add 1D3 San-
ity points. Make a Sanity roll—if successful, insanity is cured.
51-95: no progress.
96–100: failure; lose 1D6 Sanity points.

chapter 16: APPENDICES 
 
 
Table VII: 
Bouts of Madness—Real Time (roll 1D10):

1) Amnesia: The investigator has no memory of events that have taken place since they were last in a place of safety. For example, it seems 
to them that one moment they were eating breakfast and the next they are facing a monster. This lasts for 1D10 rounds.

2) Psychosomatic disability: The investigator suffers psychosomatic blindness, deafness, or loss of the use of a limb or limbs for 1D10 rounds.

3) Violence: A red mist descends on the investigator and they explode in a spree of uncontrolled violence and destruction directed at their 
surroundings, allies or foes alike for 1D10 rounds. 

4) Paranoia: The investigator suffers severe paranoia for 1D10 rounds; everyone is out to get them; no one can be trusted; they are being spied 
on; someone has betrayed them; what they are seeing is a trick.

5) Significant Person: Review the investigator’s backstory entry for Significant People. The investigator mistakes another person in the 
scene for their Significant Person. Consider the nature of the relationship; the investigator acts upon it. This lasts 1D10 rounds. 

6) Faint: The investigator faints. They recover after 1D10 rounds.

7) Flee in panic: The investigator is compelled to get as far away as possible by whatever means are available, even if it means taking the only 
vehicle and leaving everyone else behind. They travel for 1D10 rounds.

8) Physical hysterics or emotional outburst: The investigator is incapacitated from laughing, crying, screaming, etc. for 1D10 rounds.

9) Phobia: Investigator gains a new phobia. Roll 1D100 on Table IX: Sample Phobias, or the Keeper may choose one. Even if the source 
of the phobia is not present, the investigator imagines it is there for the next 1D10 rounds.

10) Mania: The investigator gains a new mania. Roll 1D100 on Table X: Sample Manias, or the Keeper may choose one. The investigator 
seeks to indulge in their new mania for the next 1D10 rounds.

Table VIII : 
Bouts of Madness—Summary (roll 1D10):

1) Amnesia: The investigator comes to their senses in some unfamiliar place with no memory of who they are. Their memories will slowly 
return to them over time.

2) Robbed: The investigator comes to their senses 1D10 hours later, having been robbed. They are unharmed. If they were carrying a 
Treasured Possession (see investigator backstory), make a Luck roll to see if it was stolen. Everything else of value is automatically missing.

3) Battered: The investigator comes to their senses 1D10 hours later to find themselves battered and bruised. Hit points are reduced to 
half of what they were before going insane, though this does not cause a Major wound. They have not been robbed. How the damage was 
sustained is up to the Keeper.

4) Violence: The investigator explodes in a spree of violence and destruction. When the investigator comes to their senses, their actions 
may or may not be apparent or remembered. Who or what the investigator has inflicted violence upon and whether they have killed or 
simply inflicted harm is up to the Keeper.

5) Ideology/Beliefs: Review the investigator’s backstory entry for Ideology and Beliefs. The investigator manifests one of these in an extreme, 
crazed and demonstrative manner. For example, a religious person might be found later, preaching the gospel loudly on the subway.

6) Significant People: Consult the investigator’s backstory entry for Significant People and why the relationship is so important. In the time 
that passes (1D10 hours or more) the investigator has done their best to get close to that person and act upon their relationship in some way.

7) Institutionalized: The investigator comes to their senses in a psychiatric ward or police cell. They may slowly recall the events that 
led them there.

8) Flee in panic: When the investigator comes to their senses they are far away, perhaps lost in the wilderness or on a train or long-distance bus.

9) Phobia: The investigator gains a new phobia. Roll 1D100 on Table IX: Sample Phobias, or the Keeper may choose one. The investi-
gator comes to their senses 1D10 hours later, having taken every precaution to avoid their new phobia.

10) Mania: The investigator gains a new mania. Roll 1D100 on Table X: Sample Manias, or the Keeper may choose one. The investigator 
comes to their senses 1D10 hours later. During this bout of madness, the investigator will have been fully indulging in their new mania. 
Whether this is apparent to other people is up to the Keeper and player.

Call of CthulhuSummary of 
 Magic Rules

Casting  time  and  spells  in  combat  (see  Chapter  12: 
Grimoire):  instantaneous—on  the  user’s  DEX+50;  one 
round—it activates on the user’s DEX in the present round; 
two rounds—it activates in the following round on the user’s 
DEX, and so on.

Initial reading of a tome: may require reading roll; variable du-
ration (hours to weeks at the Keeper’s discretion); results in 
Sanity point loss (if a believer); reader gains Cthulhu Mythos 
skill points as noted in the tome description.

Believer: while a nonbeliever, gain Cthulhu Mythos skill but 
do  not  lose  Sanity  points  for  reading  tomes;  with  first  loss 
of Sanity points to direct experience of the Cthulhu Mythos, 
also lose Sanity points equal to Cthulhu Mythos skill.

Increasing POW 
A  spell  requiring  an  opposed  POW  roll  to  affect  a  target  is 
successfully  cast  (the  opposed  roll  is  won)—roll  1D100;  if 
greater than POW (or roll 96 or greater), POW increases by 
1D10 points permanently.

A Luck roll result of 01—roll 1D100; if greater than POW (or 
roll 96 or greater), POW increases by 1D10 points permanently.

Reading Roll:
Printed within the last century and in good condition: 
Regular difficulty.

Handwritten (especially if old): Hard difficulty level.

Most challenging of ancient, moldering tomes: Extreme 
difficulty level.

Full study of a tome: an initial reading must first be complet-
ed; no reading roll required; see Table XI: Mythos Tomes  
(page  237)  for  study  time;  results  in  Sanity  point  loss  (if  a 
believer); if the tome’s Mythos rating is greater than the read-
er’s Cthulhu Mythos skill, the reader gains the full Cthulhu 
Mythos benefit; if Cthulhu Mythos skill is greater than tome’s 
Mythos rating, gain only half Cthulhu Mythos benefit; each 
subsequent full study doubles in study time.

For details of tomes see Chapter 11: Tomes of Eldritch 

Lore and Forgotten Secrets.

Initial reading: Reading roll may be required. Keeper decides 
on  time  required.  Roll  for  Sanity  loss  and  increase  Cthulhu 
Mythos skill by tome's CMI value.

Using a tome as a reference book: must have completed 
a full study; 1D4 hours; roll less than or equal to the book’s 
Cthulhu Mythos Rating. 

Magic points, overspending: take additional Magic points 
from hit points.

Magic  points,  recovery:  1  Magic  point  per  hour  (more  if 
POW is over 100).

Learning a spell from a Mythos book: complete an Initial 
reading; variable duration (hours to weeks at Keeper’s discre-
tion, typically 2D6 weeks); make a Hard INT roll (optional).

Learning a spell from another person: as from a book, but faster.

Learning a spell from a Mythos entity: very fast; INT roll 
to retain spell.

Initial casting of a spell: make a Hard POW roll; either Push 
or fully relearn spell; failing the Pushed roll allows the spell 
to be cast but costs 1D6 x MP and Sanity points, and incurs 
other side-effects.
