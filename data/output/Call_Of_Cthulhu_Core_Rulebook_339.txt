 has  a  speed  of  half  a  mile 
per  hour  per  point  of  POW  of  the  participating  polyp.  This 
windstorm is local, losing 5 mph of force for every 200 yards it 
travels. A group of polyps can generate hurricane-force winds 
within an area of a few square miles. Targets take 1D4 damage 
for  every  20  mph  above  100  mph  of  wind  speed;  those  that 
succeed in a Luck roll take half damage.

Fighting 85% (42/17), damage 1D10 
Wind blast  70% (35/14), damage bonus (lowered by 1D6 per 20 

yards distance)
Dodge 30% (15/6)
Armor:  4  points,  plus  invisibility.  The  extra-terrene  polyp  takes 
only  minimum  damage  from  physical  weapons,  which  is 
reduced  again  by  4  points  due  to  the  monster’s  skin  armor. 
Enchanted weapons do full normal damage, as do forces such 
as heat or electricity.

Sanity Loss: 1D3/1D20 Sanity points to see a flying polyp.

Formless Spawn
When the men of K’n-Yan went down into N’Kai’s black abyss 
with their great atom-power searchlights, they found living 
things—living things that oozed along stone channels and 
worshipped onyx and basalt images of Tsathoggua. But they 
were not toads like Tsathoggua himself. Far worse—
they were amorphous lumps of viscous black 
slime that took temporary shapes for various 
purposes. The explorers of K’N-Yan did not 
pause for detailed observations, and those 
that escaped alive sealed the passage. 
—H.P. Lovecraft and Zealia Bishop, The 
Mound

These  black,  protean  beings  change 
shapes  in  an  instant,  from  toad-like 
lumps to elongated things with hun-
dreds of rudimentary legs. They ooze 
through  small  cracks  and  enlarge 
their  appendages  at  will.  They  are 
closely  associated  with  Tsathoggua, 
often found in his temples or in sun-

less caverns.

ATTACKS 
Attacks per round: 2 (limited to 1 Bite per round)
Fighting  attacks:  Due  to  their  extreme  fluidity  they  are  able  to 
attack in a wide variety of ways, forming whips, tentacles, and 
other  appendages  with  which  to  bludgeon  and  strike  their 
opponents.

Bite: The victim is instantly swallowed. Each round thereafter the 
victim takes 1 point of damage from constriction—the damage 
done  per  round  progressively  increasing  by  1  point  (e.g.,  on 
the second round 2 points of damage are taken, and so forth). 
While  swallowed,  the  victim  may
