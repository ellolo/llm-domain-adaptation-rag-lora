 
riddle memory-fragments to entice the victim into perform-
ing certain actions. Eventually the host is so hypnotized that 
he or she gladly (knowingly or unknowingly) helps the shan. 
Often such progressively increasing control causes the victim 
to go raving mad, and thus become an unsuitable host.

Spells: Shan have an 80% chance of knowing 2D10 spells, 
usually including Call Azathoth.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 1
Fighting attacks: An insect from Shaggai relies on either its nerve-
whip or on its ability to possess the target (meld) and has no 
innate Fighting skill otherwise.

Nerve Whip: The nerve whip is a small technical device that proj-
ects  a  chattering  line  of  pallid  light. When  the  light  strikes  a 
target, make an opposed POW roll. If the shan wins, the target 
is overcome by agony and can do nothing but writhe on the 
ground until the weapon is turned off. If the attack fails, the 
target  is  still  in  pain  and  all  rolls  are  made  with  one  penalty 
die for a number of hours equal to 24 minus one-fifth of the 
victim’s CON. The attack may be renewed each round and the 
penalties are cumulative.

Meld: This represents the shan’s chance to fly into a human’s head 

and stay there.

Nerve Whip 50% (25/10), damage special
Meld 60% (30/12), no damage, however the insect gains progres-

sive control after it enters the brain of target

Dodge 77% (38/15) 
Armor: None.
Sanity Loss: 0/1D6 Sanity points to see a shan.

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsShantak

It is believed that shantaks provide service for Nylar-
thotep  and  perhaps  also  for  the  Wendigo  (Ithaqua), 
although such rumors are rife with misleading informa-
tion. The Book of Eibon recounts how a shantak was 
summoned to act as a steed; however, once the jour-
ney had begun, the creature took no heed of its sum-
moner’s commands and instead attempted to travel to 
the court of Azathoth. Only quick thinking, resulting 
in the killing of the shantak, saved the traveler from a 
hideous fate.

Shantak

Not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth…for they 
were larger than elephants and had heads like a horse’s…The 
Shantak-bird has scales instead of feathers and those scales 
are very slippery.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath

Shantaks  brood  in  cavernous  holes  and  their  wings  are 
encrusted  with  rime  and  nitre.  They  are  always  described 
as noisome and loathly, and are often used as steeds by the 
servants of the Outer Gods. They have an extreme fear of 
nightgaunts and always retreat from them. 

Shantaks  can  fly  through  space  and  have  been  known 
to carry an unwary rider straight to the throne of Azathoth.
