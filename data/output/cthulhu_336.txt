Elder Thing
They represented some ridged barrel-shaped object with 
thin horizontal arms radiating spoke-like from a central 
ring and with vertical knobs or bulbs projecting from 
the head and base of the barrel. Each of these knobs 
was the hub of a system of five long, flat, triangular-
ly tapering arms arranged around it like the arms 
of a starfish.

These appeared as thousands of tiny points of light…The 
myriad points of light were living entities of flame! Where 
they touched, fire sprang up.
