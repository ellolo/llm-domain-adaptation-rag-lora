 

Remember,  it’s  not  what  your  investigator  can  or 
can’t do, it’s how you decide to ‘play’ your character 
that is really important, and that, above all, will often 
determine your enjoyment of the game! 

Credit Rating
An  investigator’s  starting  Credit  Rating  is  determined 
during  character  creation,  based  upon  the  investigator’s 
chosen  profession  (see  Sample  Occupations  page  40).  In 
play, Credit Rating determines the amount of money a char-
acter  has  available  (see  Table  II:  Cash  and Assets).  Credit 
Rating also indicates the general living standards a person 
can afford, as well as indicating the character’s relative status 
in society (see Credit Rating in Chapter 4: Skills).

Your investigator’s Credit Rating skill begins at zero. The 
range  of  starting  levels  for  each  profession  can  be  broad,
