 (1D3 
from Medicine skill roll). After a week of rest Harvey 
makes a recovery roll (see below).

Regular Damage Recovery
Recovering from regular damage is relatively fast. If the char-
acter has not sustained a major wound (the major wound box 
is unchecked) the character recovers 1 hit point per day.

In  another  incident,  Harvey  (who  has  a  total  of 
15  hit  points)  takes  4  damage,  then  6,  then  7.  He 
has taken a total of 17 damage, but as negative hit 
points  are  not  recorded  his  current  hit  points  now 
equal zero. He has only taken regular damage (none 
of the attacks, in themselves, cost more than half of 
Harvey’s  maximum  hit  points)  and  so  Harvey  re-
covers one hit point per day and is back to full health 
after 15 days.

Trips to the hospital will become routine for investigators.

Major Wound Recovery
A CON roll should be made at the end of each week of game 
time that the Major Wound box is ticked,

T  If the CON roll is failed, no recovery takes place that 
week. On a success, 1D3 hit points are recovered.
T  On  an  Extreme  success,  2D3  hit  points  are  recov-

ered.

T  Add a bonus die: If the character has complete rest 

in a comfortable environment.

T  Add  a  bonus  die:  If  the  character  receives  effective 
medical care. The care giver with the highest Medicine 
skill should make one Medicine skill roll at the end of 
the week (before the patient’s CON roll is made).
T  Add a penalty die: If the character is in a poor en-
vironment and is unable to take sufficient rest, and/
or a fumble was rolled on their doctor’s (or nurse’s) 
Medicine skill roll.

A major wound is healed (erase the major wound marker) 
when the character either rolls an Extreme success for their 
recovery  (CON  roll),  or  when  their  current  hit  points  have 
recovered to half or more than half of their full hit point total.
If the roll is a fumble, a lasting injury, complication, or 
worse  condition  results.  Rather  than  rolling  for  a  random 
complication, the Keeper is encouraged to pick something 
that  relates  to  the  nature  of  the  character’s  injuries  (e.g. 
permanent limp, blindness in one eye, missing fingers, loss 
of a limb, scarred face, etc.) and make an entry in the inves-
tigator’s backstory (under Wounds and Scars).
