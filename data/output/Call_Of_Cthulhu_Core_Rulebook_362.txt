Star Spawn

Star-Spawn of Cthulhu

They all lay in stone houses in their great city of R’lyeh, 
preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious 
resurrection when the stars and the earth might  
once more be ready…

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu

These  gigantic  octopoid  beings  resemble  Cthulhu  himself, 
yet are smaller in stature. Not all the inhabitants of R’lyeh 
were  trapped  in  its  watery  angles  when  it  sank.  Some  still 
live on in the deep trenches beneath the ocean, where they 
are tended by the deep ones. Related entities also dwell in 
the stars, such as the beings said to infest the Lake of Hali on 
a planet near the star Aldebaran, in Taurus.

Star Vampire

The dim outlines of a presence came into view; the blood-
filled outlines of that unseen shambler from the stars. It was 
red and dripping; an immensity of pulsing, moving jelly; a 
scarlet blob with myriad tentacular trunks that waved and 
wavered. There were suckers on the tips of the appendages, 
and these were opening and closing with ghoulish lust…The 
thing was bloated and obscene; a headless, faceless, eyeless 
bulk with the ravenous maw and titanic talons of a star-born 
monster. The human blood on which it had fed revealed the 
hitherto invisible out-lines of the feaster.

—Robert Bloch, The Shambler from the Stars

Call of CthulhuThese  loathsome  things  are  normally  invisible,  their  pres-
ence  signaled  only  by  a  sort  of  ghoulish  tittering  sound. 
After feeding, they become visible through the blood they 
drink.

Summoned from the depths of space, some can be con-

trolled to serve powerful wizards or other beings.

SPECIAL POWERS

Invisible: 
Those 
attempting  to  attack 
a star vampire suffer 
a  penalty  die  to  hit, 
even if it is tittering. 
After 
feeding,  the 
star  vampire  remains 
visible  for  six  rounds, 
while the fresh blood me-
tabolizes into a transparent 
equivalent.  While  it  can  be 
seen, attacks can be made at 
a normal chance to hit.
