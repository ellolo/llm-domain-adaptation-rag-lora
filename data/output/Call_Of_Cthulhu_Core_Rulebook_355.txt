Sand-Dweller
Then out of one of the caves came a Sand-Dweller—rough-
skinned, large-eyed, large-eared, with a horrible, distorted 
resemblance to the koala bear facially, though his body had 
an appearance of emaciation. He shambled  
toward me, manifestly eager.

—H.P. Lovecraft and August Derleth, The Gable Window

This  obscure  race  look  as  though  they  are  encrusted  with 
sand. They dwell in caverns deep in desert areas and come 
out  at  night  to  prowl  and  hunt  for  prey.  They  are  known 
to  live  in  the American  South West  and  may  live  in  other 
deserts  of  the  world  as  well.  They  are  known  to  serve  the 
Great Old Ones.

Spells: Full serpent folk know at least 2D6 appropriate 
spells.  A  common  spell  among  them  is  an  illusion 
that transforms the caster’s appearance into that of 
a  normal  human,  allowing  the  serpent  person  to 
mingle in human society (see Consume Likeness, 
page 250).

Note  that  degenerate  forms  are  not

ground dirge rising to a maddening cacophony of piping.
They sometimes play for groups of cultists as well, 
perhaps aiding in the summoning of dark entities or 
gods.  Either  way,  the  god  or  entity  arrives  1D3+1 
rounds  after  the  servitor  announces  it  and  de-
parts  when  dismissed  by  the  servitor,  or  2D6 
rounds after the servitor’s death, or when the 
god pleases. Summoning costs the servitor 
a magic point, and another magic point 
for each five rounds that the summoned 
being remains.
