of  the  enchanter’s  own  POW  must  be 
sacrificed. From then on, when the dag-
ger is used properly to sacrifice chosen 
victims in the presence of Nyarlathotep, 
the  POW  of  the  victim  flows  into  the 
dagger,  and  from  the  dagger  the  POW 
can  be  sent  to  any  convenient  storage 
site—the caster or an inanimate object.

Enchant Whistle
Cost: variable POW; 1D4 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 day

Augments  the  caster’s  chance  to  Sum-
mon/Bind Byakhee. The spell enchants 
a  whistle,  which  must  be  an  alloy  of 
silver and iron meteorite. For each point 
of POW sacrificed to the whistle, add 2 
percentiles to the chance of successfully 
casting Summon/Bind Byakhee.

Enthrall Victim
Cost: 2 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points
Casting time: 1 round

The caster must be able to speak calmly 
with the target before the spell can take 
effect.  After  a  round  or  so  of  talking, 
an  opposed  POW  roll  must  be  made 
between the caster and target on 1D100. 
If  overcome,  the  victim  stands  struck, 
numb  and  dumb,  until  relieved  from 
the  trance  by  physical  assault  or  some 
similarly  shocking  event.  If  the  caster 
fails  to  overcome  the  target,  he  or  she 
may try the spell the following round.

Alternative  names:  Strike  Dumb,  The 

Silver Beguiling Tongue.

Evil Eye
Cost:  10  magic  points;  1D4  Sanity 
points
Casting time: 1 round

Casting this spell causes a victim to suffer 
from bad luck. While the target must be 
within sight of the caster, the victim will 
not necessarily sense the Evil Eye spell’s 
influence, but is likely to feel an odd chill 
or unease when the Evil Eye is cast.

With  a  successful  casting,  the  vic-
tim’s  chance  for  a  Luck  roll  is  halved*. 
*Neither  can  the  victim  spend  or  gain 
luck points if the Optional Luck Rule is 
being used. 

Call of CthulhuThe victim must apply one penalty die to all character-
istic rolls, and his or her guns jam on every roll of 75% or 
higher.  The  chances  for
