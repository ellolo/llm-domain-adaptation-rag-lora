 than tome’s 
Mythos rating, gain only half Cthulhu Mythos benefit; each 
subsequent full study doubles in study time.

For details of tomes see Chapter 11: Tomes of Eldritch 

Lore and Forgotten Secrets.

Initial reading: Reading roll may be required. Keeper decides 
on  time  required.  Roll  for  Sanity  loss  and  increase  Cthulhu 
Mythos skill by tome's CMI value.

Using a tome as a reference book: must have completed 
a full study; 1D4 hours; roll less than or equal to the book’s 
Cthulhu Mythos Rating. 

Magic points, overspending: take additional Magic points 
from hit points.

Magic  points,  recovery:  1  Magic  point  per  hour  (more  if 
POW is over 100).

Learning a spell from a Mythos book: complete an Initial 
reading; variable duration (hours to weeks at Keeper’s discre-
tion, typically 2D6 weeks); make a Hard INT roll (optional).

Learning a spell from another person: as from a book, but faster.

Learning a spell from a Mythos entity: very fast; INT roll 
to retain spell.

Initial casting of a spell: make a Hard POW roll; either Push 
or fully relearn spell; failing the Pushed roll allows the spell 
to be cast but costs 1D6 x MP and Sanity points, and incurs 
other side-effects.
