hit points” in 
place of “build”. Thus, a car that is in a moderate incident 
suffers  1D6  build  damage  and  each  occupant  of  the  car 
suffers 1D6 hit points of damage.

Most collisions should also result in a delay as the vehicle 

skids or loses speed (costing 1D3 movement actions).

Key
MOV:  A  rating  of  the  vehicle’s  speed  and  maneuverability 
in  chases.  These  ratings  are  for  modern  vehicles  and  may  be 
reduced by around 20% for 1920s vehicles (though there were 
cars in the 1920s that could exceed 100 MPH). 

Build: A rating of the strength and size of the vehicle. When 
reduced  to  zero,  the  vehicle  is  out  of  action.  Each  full  10  hit 
points of damage decreases a vehicle’s build by 1 point (round 
down); damage below 10 hit points is ignored.

If  a  vehicle’s  build  is  reduced  to  half  (round  down)  of  its 
starting value or lower, it is impaired; one penalty die is applied 
to all Drive Auto (or appropriate skill) rolls.

If a vehicle takes damage equal to its full build value in one 
incident,  the  vehicle  is  completely  wrecked  in  an  impressive 
manner. It may explode, burn, roll or suffer some combination 
thereof. All occupants of the vehicle are likely to die. Whether or 
not investigators have a chance of survival is up to the Keeper: 
Luck rolls may be allowed. Those who are fortunate get thrown 
free, though it is recommended they take at least 2D10
