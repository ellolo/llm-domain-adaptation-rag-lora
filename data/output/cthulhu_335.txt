  name  and  a 
description  of  a  hide.  It  is  assumed  that  they  are  entities 
capable  of  walking  between  the  planes  and  worlds  of  the 
universe, never spending much time at any one location.

Rumors  suggest  that  these  entities  occasionally  serve  a 
god or a Great Old One, however their individual motiva-
tions and purpose remain a mystery.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Trans-dimensional Travel: Able to leave a plane of existence 
at will, signaling the change by beginning to shimmer and 
fade. This transition costs them 4 magic points and takes a 
round to complete. During this time they may be attacked, 
however they cannot inflict damage on their attackers.

A  shambler  can  take  objects  or  beings  with  it  when  it 
fades  into  another  dimension.  By  clutching  the  desired 
object in its talons and expending an additional magic point 
per 50 SIZ points of the object or creature, that which is held 
makes  the  transit  also.  Objects  and  victims  lost  are  never 
found again.

Spells: Dimensional shamblers have a 40% 

chance of knowing 1D3 spells.

Call of CthulhuA complete description of one of these beings can be found in 
At the Mountains of Madness by Lovecraft: it notes that the en-
tity stands about eight feet tall, with a six-foot torso, and that 
it has wings, which neatly fold up into slots. In that story this 
race is referred to as the Old Ones. Elder things communicate 
by piping whistles and can sense without light.

Elder things came to Earth a billion years ago and may 
have accidentally started terrestrial life through arcane ex-
perimentation. They created the blasphemous shoggoths to 
serve as slaves. Their race began to degenerate before man 
evolved, and they at least partially lost their former ability 
to fly through space on their membranous wings. After nu-
merous wars with other races, the mi-go and the star-spawn 
prime among them, and the rebellion of their former slaves, 
the shoggoths, the amphibious elder things were eventually 
driven back to Antarctica in the last few million years, where 
their last city remains frozen under a glacier. Their civiliza-
tion was eventually wiped out by the cold of the ice age. The 
elder things are extinct on land, however they may still have 
colonies in the deepest waters. 

Time-travelling  witches  and  sorcerers  have  sometimes 
sought  out  elder  things  in  order  to  further  their  learning 
and  understanding  of  the  universe  and  Mythos  matters. 
Such  testimony  also  hints  at  non-degenerate  elder  things 
still living among the stars.

Spells:  Elder  things  have  a  70%  chance  of  knowing  1D4
