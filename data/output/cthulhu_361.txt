. Shoggoth lords care only about satisfying 
themselves. Though more sophisticated than most predators, 
they are given to the same grandiose claims of territory and to 
murderous squabbles among themselves. They are not social, 
they do not die natural deaths, nor do they breed.

Because  of  the  great  control  required  to  sustain  their 
human guises, certain characteristics in their human form 
are lower than when in their natural state.

SHOGGOTH LORD, Corpulent monstrosities

Shoggoth Lord
You cannot imagine the Shoggoth Lord’s mastery of shapes! His 
race has bred smaller since modern man last met with it. Oh, but 
the Shoggoth Lords are limber now! Supremest polymorph—
though what they are beneath all else, is Horror itself.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 2
Fighting attacks: A shoggoth lord will attempt to engulf its living 
prey into its bubbling gelatinous body. When it takes prey, it 
seizes and holds its victim as it begins to suck it into its body 
mass, where it can be digested. While being digested, the victim 
suffers 1D6 hit points damage each round from the caustic ac-
ids and digestive fluids breaking down the unfortunate’s body.
Those so held may attempt to break free each round by an opposed 
STR roll. Unlike their larger cousins, shoggoth lords may only 
feed on one victim at a time. While feeding, the shoggoth lord 
may not use its crush attack, although it can still lash out with 
its powerful pseudopod fists.

Fighting  90%  (45/18),  damage  1D6+2  +  damage  bonus  appro-
priate to its present form; or engulf a target, damage 1D6 per 
round (acid damage) until victim is dead

Dodge 26% (13/5)
Armor: None, but (1) fire and electrical attacks do only half dam-
age; (2) physical weapons such as firearms and knives do only 1 
point of damage per hit; (3) a shoggoth regenerates 2 hit points 
per round.

Skills: Charm 70%, Intimidate 60%, Persuade 60%, Stealth 65%, 

more as the Keeper desires.

Sanity Loss: 1D6/1D20 Sanity points to see a shoggoth lord in its 
true form. Keepers may add 1/1D3 Sanity point loss for those
