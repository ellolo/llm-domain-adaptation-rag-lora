only connections to the world are madness and pain.

When crafting background entries, be specific, 
emotional and emphatic

Try to phrase each entry to emphasize its personal nature. 
For  example, “my  wife”  identifies  the  subject,  but  tells  us 
nothing about the nature of the relationship.

A)  Specify a name. Name the person or place, identify 

the item or concept.

B)  Attach a feeling. Start with positive or negative and 

build from there. 

Make it intense, use love instead of like, use despise instead 
of dislike. Be emphatic; use must in place of would prefer. Try to 
phrase it in a way that makes it personal and meaningful.

Consider  "wife"  as  a  starting  point.  Now  give  her  a 
name,  'My  wife,  Annabel".  Now  be  emotional,  “My 
beloved  wife,  Annabel".  Now  be  emphatic,  "My 
beloved  wife,  Annabel.  I  couldn’t  live  without  her". 
That  short  journey  delivers  a  lot  more  information 
and  context.  Of  course  it  could  have  been  developed 
differently,  consider:  "My  wife  Annabel,  who  makes 
my life a misery", "My poor wife Annabel; if only we 
could have a child together".

Using Random Tables for Inspiration
Sometimes  coming  up  with  background  details  on  the  fly 
can be difficult. The following random tables provide a way 
to quickly determine some background details—you can ei-
ther roll on the tables or simply pick ones that seem suitable, 
or just use the lists for inspiration. 

As appropriate, roll 1D10 on each of the following charts 
to select an entry for each category. Each option has some 
examples  to  get  you  started.  Don’t  feel  constrained  to  use 
what you roll; if it doesn’t mesh with your character concept 
then roll again or choose a different option. However, don’t 
dismiss it out of hand; sometimes something that is at first 
incongruous will add an unexpected but welcome twist to 
a character. 

Above all, be clear that the random tables are there as a 
springboard  for  your  imagination.  Each  dice  roll  will  give 
you something from that realm of life to react to; embrace 
it or reject it, but be sure to react to it and use it to help fuel 
your imagination. Weave the background together to make 
a credible all-round character.

"Dear, did you hear something outside?"

You might be creating a male investigator in his twenties, 
with  no  thought  of  any  family.  Rolling  for ‘significant 
people’ indicates a child. You may not have considered 
that your character has a child, but why not? Becoming 
a  father  may  not  have  been  intentional.  Consider  the 
options;  you  may  have  had  an  affair  with  a  married 
woman,  your  wife  may  have  died  and  your  child  fos-
tered, or you may be happily married with a family.
