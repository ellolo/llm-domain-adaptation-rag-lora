Ghast

Ghoul

These figures were seldom completely human, but often 
approached humanity in varying degree. Most of the bodies, 
while roughly bipedal, had a forward slumping, and a 
vaguely canine cast. The texture of the majority was a kind of 
unpleasant rubberiness.

Call of CthulhuGhouls are loathsome humanoids with rubbery skin, hoof-
like  feet,  canine  features,  and  claws.  They  speak  in  what 
are  described  as  gibberings  and  meepings.  They  are  often 
encrusted with grave mold collected as they feed.

They dwell in tunnel systems beneath many cities, often 
centered  on  graveyards  and  ancient  catacombs.  They  are 
known  to  have  commerce  with  witches  and  those  seeking 
unspeakable  pleasures,  although  an  unwitting  human  is 
more likely to be attacked when encountered. 

Dark  lore  suggests  that  it  is  possible  for  a  human  to 

transform into a ghoul over a prolonged period.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 3
Fighting attacks: Ghouls have the usual range of unarmed attacks 
open to humanoids. Also ghouls have claws that are razor-sharp 
and filthy; these bony protrusions slice through human flesh in 
an instant. Wounds caused may become diseased if not treated. 
Bite  and  hold  (mnvr):  If  the  ghoul’s  bite  strikes  home  it  hangs 
on  instead  of  using  claw  attacks,  and  worries 
the  victim  with  its  fangs,  continuing  to  do 
1D4  damage  automatically  per  round.  An 
opposed  STR  roll  is  required  to  dislodge 
the ghoul, breaking the hold and ending the 
bite damage.

Ghouls may be the truth that lies behind the myth of 
the  changeling—the  belief  that  faeries  steal  young 
babies, leaving "wild things" in their place. The wild 
things appear human initially, becoming stranger and 
weirder  as  they  grow  older  until  one  day,  normally 
around maturity, they disappear.

corpse—bloodless and skeletal, and with  
impossibly long, cracked nails.
