Shoggoth
The nightmare, plastic column of fetid, black iridescence oozed 
tightly onward…A shapeless congerie of protoplasmic bubbles, 
faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes 
forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light all over 
the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the 
frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it 
and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter. Still came that 
eldritch mocking cry—”Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”

—H.P. Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness

Shoggoths are among the most horrible and loathsome of 
Mythos monsters. Mighty sacks of protoplasm, roughly 15-
feet in diameter, these amphibious creatures are able to form 
limbs, eyes, and other appendages at will, imitate other life 
forms, and perform great feats of strength. They communi-
cate in whatever manner their master race wishes, forming 
special organs for the purpose.

Despite  Abdul  Alhazred's  claims  that  there  were  none 
on Earth itself, save in the crazed nightmares of dreamers, 
shoggoths do exist in deep and dark places. Often found as 
servants of deep ones and other races, they are surly at best, 
ever becoming more intelligent, more rebellious, and more 
imitative. Their creators, the ancient elder things, found to 
their cost the true nature of their servants in a rebellion that 
virtually destroyed their civilization. 

SPECIAL POWERS
