vestigator  fatality  be  suf-
fered during the scenario! 
(As  long  as  she’s  not  the 
culprit of course.)

If chosen as the Cul-
prit: Court makes for an 
interesting  if  outwardly 
unlikely  suspect.  If  the 
Keeper  chooses  her  for 
the  culprit  she  hides  a 
far darker heart than any 
around  her  guess.  Per-
haps she plotted the theft 
of the Witch Trial Papers 
to  safeguard  them  after 
her  independent  discov-
ery  of  Leiter’s  forgery 
ring, or perhaps she knew the particular significance of the 
papers and their otherworldly nature and so plotted Leiter’s 
death to obtain them. If this is the case she will have stalked 
Cecil Hunter in his apartment, willfully condemning him to 
the horrors they contained, unleashing the nightmare from 
the  papers.  She  is,  as  stated,  from  old  Providence  money, 
and who is to say that the Courts are not close kin to the 
Curwens,  the  Marshes  or  even  that  once  their  name  was 
Mason. If you decide this is the case, you should rework her 
character as a witch, giving her a Cthulhu Mythos skill and 
spells. Alternatively perhaps a wizard (one of her ancestors) 
has used the Consume Likeness or Mind Exchange spell and 
stolen her identity so that he can get hold of the papers.

Harland Roach, Rival Academic to the 
Dead Man
Roach is a paunchy, sweaty man with thick bottle-bottom 
spectacles  and  thinning,  oiled  hair  he  interferes  with 
whenever nervous or agitated, which is often. He looks per-
manently rumpled and disheveled in unkempt tweeds and 
shirts whose collars look wringing wet half the time—this 
coupled  with  a  ten-
dency to look at women 
and  children  as  if  they 
were  a  strange  form 
of 
inexplicable  pond 
life,  and  a  voice  with  a 
grating  nasal  whine—
offer  the  explanation 
as  to  why  despite  his 
superior  erudition  and 
an enviable list of pub-
lished  works,  he  lost 
out  to  Leiter  time  and 
again.

steal the papers for himself, but instead uncovered the fact 
that the Witch Trial Papers are missing. 

Facts and Clues

T  Roach  has  made  a  survey  of  Leiter’s  papers  and 
went  to  Leiter’s  cottage  with  the  Dean  and  one  of 
the  university’s  handymen  to  gather  up  any  more 
papers.  While  there,  Roach  uncovered  first-hand 
evidence of past forgeries, as well as books and ma-
terials taken from the university without authority.
