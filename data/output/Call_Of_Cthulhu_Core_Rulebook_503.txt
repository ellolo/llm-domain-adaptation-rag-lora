 (round 
down); damage below 10 points is ignored.

Random locations: Roll 1D100:
01-59 = 1 open location
60+ = 1 Regular hazard
85+ = 1 Hard hazard 
96+ = 1 Extreme hazard 

Environment is especially hazardous: add a penalty die.

Environment is unlikely to have any dangers or delays: 
add a bonus die.

Sudden hazards: Once per round there is the option to call 
for a group Luck roll. Winner (Keeper or players) gets to place 
a regular hazard where they wish. Keeper and players must 
alternate in who calls for a sudden hazard.

Call of Cthulhu 
 
 
 
Pedal to the Metal
A driver can elect to move 2 or 3 locations 
with  one  movement  action.  Any  hazards 
encountered have one penalty die applied to 
the skill rolls.

A  driver  can  elect  to  move  4  or  5  lo-
cations  with  one  movement  action.  Any 
hazards encountered have two penalty dice 
applied to the skill rolls.

One passenger can assist the driver with 
navigation  and  spotting  ways  to  negotiate 
hazards. With a successful Spot Hidden or 
Navigate  roll,  on  the  vehicle’s  next  move, 
the vehicle can accelerate once with 1 fewer 
penalty die.

Firearms:  Penalty  die  while  moving.  No 
penalty  die  if  remaining  stationary  and 
spending 1 movement action.

Tires:  Penalty  die  to  target  tires.  Armor:3. 
Hit  points:  2  (only  damaged  by  impaling 
weapons). Destroying a tire reduces vehicle 
Build by 1.

Driver  damage:  If  the  driver  of  a  moving 
vehicle takes a major wound he or she may 
lose  control  of  their  vehicle  and  must  roll 
immediately as for a Hazard at Hard difficulty 
level.

Switching  between  being  running  and 
driving:  Make  a  fresh  speed  roll.  Recalcu-
late movement actions. 

Monsters in Chases
Where the monster or non-player character 
has  an  implied  aptitude,  use  their  DEX  in 
place of the skill.

Where  the  monster  or  non-player  char-
acter has an implied ineptitude, use one-fifth 
of their DEX in place of the skill (or simply 
rule the attempt to be an automatic failure).
the  monster  or  non-player 
character  has  neither  implied  aptitude  nor 
ineptitude, use half of their DEX in place of 
the skill.

Where 

If  other  skills  are  required,  the  Keeper 
might use a similar approach, using what he 
or she feels to be the most appropriate char-
acteristic from which to derive skill values.
