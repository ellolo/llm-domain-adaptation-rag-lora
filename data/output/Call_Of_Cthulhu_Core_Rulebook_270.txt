chapter 11: Tomes of Eldritch Lore240 

Call of CthulhuSpells

he  spells  described  within  the  Grimoire  are 
listed alphabetically, each detailing the standard 
purpose and result of a successful casting. Keep-
ers  are  encouraged  to  further  develop,  alter, 
and enhance the spells listed here. A spell may 
be found in a tome that produces a weaker effect than that 
stated in the Grimoire; equally, more powerful versions may 
be encountered. 

The Keeper should modify spells according to the needs 
of a particular scenario or campaign. Care should be taken 
when  creating  more  powerful  versions  of  the  spells  and 
putting them into the hands of the investigators. Such de-
vices often unbalance the game and it should be noted that 
spell-craft is the realm of insane wizards steeped in the lore 
of the Mythos. Spells should never be considered mundane 
within  the  world  of  the  game.  These  are  not  superpowers 
to be used lightly by investigators, and meddling with such 
otherworldly  forces  is  likely  to  cripple  the  unwary  user  in 
both mind and body. Further advice on how to alter spells is 
offered in Spell Variations (see nearby).

The Keeper should take careful note of which investigators 
know magic. An investigator  might cast a spell involuntarily 
while under the Keeper’s control during a bout of madness.

Spell Names
While each spell has a standard name, Keepers are strongly 
advised  to  use  more  evocative  titles  wherever  possible.  Dif-
ferent Mythos tomes may contain common spells; however, 
such  authors  will  have  comprehended  the  spells  quite  dif-
ferently, one author naming the spell Contact Deep One as 
“The Voice from the Deeps” for example, and another calling 
it “Summon the Abyssal Foulness.” Different spells may even 
have the same or similar names. Suggestions for alternative 
names are provided at the end of each spell’s description.

Deeper Magic
The path to Mythos wisdom and knowledge leads to insanity. 
Sanity gauges a person’s hold on what we term "reality," which 
is not reality at all but only a consensual human delusion or 
limited understanding that protects the mind from that which 
it cannot fully comprehend: the Cthulhu Mythos. Mythos mag-
ic is antithetical and corrosive to human sanity; the casting of 
spells will eat away at sanity, gradually disintegrating the caster’s 
link to the human world until the day comes when the Mythos 
is all that remains. A cultist’s ultimate aim is to relinquish all 
trace of human sanity and replace it with an understanding of 
the true nature of the universe. The loss of all sanity would in-
capacitate most people, leaving them unable
