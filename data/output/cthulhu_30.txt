chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORS5 Personal Interest SkillsCalculate personal inter-est points by multiplying INT by 2. Allot these points to any skills to round out the investigator (not forgetting fighting and firearms skills, if appropriate).The number for un-armed combat is your investigator’s Fighting (Brawl) skill.Points not allotted are lost!6 Combat ValuesDetermine Damage Bonus & Build by adding STR + SIZ and looking up the result:STR+SIZDBBuild2 to 64–2–265 to 84 –1–185 to 1240  0125 to 164 +1D4  1165 to 204+1D6  2.Copy your skill points into the Dodge box so that all your combat skills are in one place for handy reference.9 Determine FinancesLook up your investigator’s Credit Rating on Table II: Cash and Assets (page 57)  to deterimine Spending Level, Cash on Hand, and Assetts, and write these in.8 Create a BackstoryThink about your investigator and write in a few pithy entries for three to six for: Personal Description, Ideology/Beliefs, Significant People, Meaningful Locations, Treasured Possessions, and Traits. It’s not essential to have an entry for each category, but the more you are able to define, the more your investigator comes to life. Use the tables on pages 53–56 for inspiration. Pick one entry and underline or star it (*) to show that it is your investigator’s key connection (see page 56). Note that the entries for the other categories are filled in during play. 10 Gear & EquipmentWrite down any important items, weapons, or equipment your investigator possesses. Consider useful tems that would normally go with your investigator’s occupation. Speak to the Keeper if you are unsure.Equipment lists can be found on page 238.Weapon lists can be found on page 250.11 Your Fellow InvestigatorsWrite the names of the other investiga-tors and their player’s names in here as a handy reminder of who’s who. There’s even a space under each person for a brief word or two to sum up their occu-paton or personality.STR+SIZDBBuild205 to 284*+2D63285 to 364+3D64365 to 444+4D65445 to 524+5D66Step 3: Decide Skills and 
Allocate Skill Points

Occupation Skills
After you have chosen an occupation, calculate your occupa-
tion skill points using the characteristics specified alongside 
the  occupation.  Allocate  the  resulting  total  as  percentage 
points among those skills listed for the occupation—your in-
vestigator’s professional skills. Points should also be allocated 
to Credit Rating within the range indicated for the occupa-
tion. Not all the skills need to have points allotted to them, 
however points left undistributed are lost. Note that each skill 
has a number in brackets next to it on the investigator sheet: 
this is the base chance of success in that skill, and any points 
allocated to that skill are added to this base number.

Write down the total points for each skill on the investi-
gator sheet (the points you’ve allocated plus the base chance 
printed on the investigator sheet). The sheet also has space
