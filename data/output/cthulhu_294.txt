The  spell  only  yields  a  time 
approximate to that desired, though 
once such a Gate is created the exact 
interval between “now” and “then” 
remains the same. 

View Gate
Cost:  variable  magic  and  Sanity 
points
Casting time: 3 rounds

When cast at a suspected Gate, this 
spell  allows  the  caster  and  compan-
ions  to  see  what,  if  anything,  is  on 
the  other  side  of  the  Gate  without 
going through it. The cost varies with 
the  number  of  magic  points  needed 
to activate the Gate. It always costs 1 
magic point and 1 Sanity point to cast 
the spell. Viewing is a variable cost, 
one-tenth  of  the  Gate  cost  (round 
up fractions). Thus a Gate costing 7 
magic points to pass through requires 
2 magic points and 2 Sanity points to 
view through. The view lasts 1D6+1 
rounds.  The  spell  may  be  cast  as 
often as the caster’s magic points and 
Sanity points allow.

If  there  is  something  horrific  to 
see, additional Sanity charges should 
be required for each viewer. Viewers 
may attempt appropriate skill rolls to 
learn where or when or what is being 
viewing.
Alternative names for Gate spells: 
Rite  of  Seeing,  (Behold)  Doorway 
to  Other  Places,  Ye  Portal  of  Many 
Journeys.  Arch  of  Time,  Gateway  to 
Things Long Past and Sights Unseen, 
The Wizard’s Trap.
