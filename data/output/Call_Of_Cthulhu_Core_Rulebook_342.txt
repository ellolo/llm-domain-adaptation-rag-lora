A hand came scrabbling up out to lever it up!…the hand of a 
corpse—bloodless and skeletal, and with  
impossibly long, cracked nails.

—R. Campbell, The Inhabitant of the Lake

Gla'aki’s slaves are undead things created by his spines. They 
share Gla'aki’s memories and become almost a part of the 
Great Old One, though they can perform many individual 
actions. 

At first they look human enough, if stiff and corpselike, 
but in time they wither and look like the undead monsters 
they  are.  After  six  decades  of  half-death,  the  servants  of 
Gla'aki  become  subject  to  the  Green  Decay  if  exposed  to 
intense light, such as daylight. The Green Decay begins to 
rot on the spot, destroying one so exposed in a few hours.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Spells: Servants of Gla'aki do not generally have any spells, 
though they retain any they knew while alive, plus any new 
spells taught by Gla'aki (at the Keeper’s discretion).

Servant of Gla'aki

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsGnoph-Keh
Gnoph-Keh, the hairy myth-thing of the Greenland ice, that 
walked sometimes on two legs, sometimes on  
four, and sometimes on six.
— H.P. Lovecraft and Hazel Heald, The Horror in the Museum

In earlier stories, Gnoph-Keh appears to be a single being. 
Later it seems to be a race of beings, possibly even a degen-
erate tribe. Here we assume that it is a sparse race of beings, 
associated with Ithaqua. 

Usually  only  one  gnoph-keh  is  encountered  at  a  time 
and the race is generally restricted to glaciers, ice caps, and 
extremely cold and icy areas. Especially harsh winters may 
bring them down into the lowlands. If a human tribe have 
indeed named themselves after the fabled gnoph-keh, per-
haps  they  worship  the  gnoph-keh  as  a  deity  or  use  it  as  a 
totem beast.

SPECIAL POWERS

Blizzard:  The  gnoph-keh  has  the  power  to  summon  a 
small  blizzard  about  itself,  restricting  visibility  to  3  yards 
maximum. This costs the creature 1 magic point per hour 
and yields a blizzard with a radius of 100 yards
