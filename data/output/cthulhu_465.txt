chapter 15: scenariosOnce the Dust has Settled
Keepers wishing to continue the story set up in this scenario 
may wish to consider the following possibilities in devising 
further adventures for the investigators.

The  Other  Buyers:  Aside  from  Abner  Wick,  Leiter  was 
beset  with  offers  for  the  papers  from  a  range  of  unsavory 
people. While such individuals have remained in the shadows 
during the scenario, they may decide to take an active inter-
est in determining the fate of the papers and Leiter. Perhaps 
they reach out to the investigators and, in so doing, draw the 
investigators into another series of mysterious events.

Abner Wick: Dependent on the events in the scenario, 
Abner  Wickâ€™s  business  and  personal  interests  provide  a 
rich  source  of  inspiration  for  Keepers  to  explore.  Perhaps 
the investigators uncover his name in the course of another 
scenario  that  leads  back  to  Unconsidered  Trifles  and  the 
hideous caves beneath. 

Non-Player Characters
Rather than provide an exhaustive list of skills, only the key 
ones expected to come up in play are provided. The Keeper 
should feel free to fill in the blanks.
