the  attack  is  made  with  one  penalty  die. When  a  polyp  is 
invisible, it does not attack with its tentacles, but may still 
use one of the wind attacks or cast spells.

Spells: Polyps have a 70% chance of knowing 1D10 spells.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 2D6 (each round, roll 2D6 to determine how 
many tentacles form); may use only one wind-based attack per 
round.

Fighting Attacks:  Polyps continually  form and dissolve  tentacles 
from their bodies. Tentacle damage is always 1D10. Because of 
the partially nonmaterial nature of these entities, the tentacle’s 
damage is done directly to the target’s hit points, ignor-
ing any body armor. The wound takes the form of a 
windburn or desiccation of tissue.

Note:  Each  of  the  polypoid  wind  abilities  cost 

them 1 magic point per round to use.
Wind  Blast:  The  wind  blast  has  a  base 
range of 20 yards and a 10-yard-di-
ameter  cylinder  of  effect  ema-
nating  from  the  polyp,  doing 
damage  equal  to  the  polyp’s 
damage  bonus.  The  cylindrical 
blast  can  extend  further  than 
20 yards, but loses 1D6 damage 
for  each  multiple  of  the  base 
distance—thus a target at 39 yards 
would  take  4D6  (damage  bonus 
minus 1D6), and a target at 41 yards 
would take 3D6 damage. Victims of the 
wind blast literally have their flesh stripped 
from  their  bones  and  their  skin  dehydrated  and 
wind-burned, and are blown backwards for a number 
of yards equal to the hit points they have lost.

Fixing Attack: This  is  a  mysterious  method  for  capturing 
prey. In this mode, the wind attack has a range of 1,000 
yards  and  can  blow  without  diminishment  around 
corners or up through winding corridors. Although the 

wind emanates from the polyp, it has a peculiar sucking effect 
on the target, slowing down him or her and forcing the target to 
make an opposed STR roll versus the polyp’s POW. Beyond 200 
yards this becomes less effective and one bonus die is granted 
to the target. If the polyp wins, the victim cannot move away 
that round. If the target wins, he or she may move normally. 
The flying polyp can move at full speed while using this ability, 
so it may be both chasing interesting prey and slowing it.
This  technique  may  be  used  on  multiple  targets  within  30  yards 
of one another. Each other target gains one bonus die on the 
STR roll to oppose the polyp. The polyp may choose its targets.
Windstorm Attack: A polyp can generate a wind in conjunction 
with  its  fellows.  The  windstorm  has  a  speed  of  half  a  mile 
per  hour  per  point  of  POW  of  the  participating  polyp.  This 
windstorm is local, losing 5 mph of force for every 200 yards it 
travels. A group of pol
