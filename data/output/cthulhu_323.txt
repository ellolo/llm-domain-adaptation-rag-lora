 be made between creatures of the same race. 

When portraying a Mythos monster, the Keeper should 
avoid only illustrating the visual aspect to the players. Smell 
and sound are important signifiers, so too is the otherworld-
ly  atmosphere  such  creatures  create.  As  the  Necronomicon 
states, “…as a foulness shall ye shall know Them.” 

Byakhee

There flapped rhythmically a horde of tame, trained, 
hybrid winged things…not altogether crows, nor moles, 
nor buzzards, nor ants, nor decomposed human beings, but 
something I cannot and must not recall.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Festival

This  interstellar  race  often  serves  Hastur  the  Unnamable, 
and may be summoned to partake in rituals. Composed of 
conventional matter, they are vulnerable to ordinary weap-
ons, such as pistols. 

Dwelling in interstellar space, byakhee do not have bases 
on  Earth,  but  may  be  summoned  to  perform  deeds  or  to 
serve as steeds, carrying riders through interstellar space.

Byakhee

Bite  and  hold  (mnvr): 
If  the  bite  strikes 
home  the  byakhee 
remains attached to the victim and begins to drain his or her 
blood.  Each  round  the  byakhee  remains  attached,  including 
the first, the blood drain subtracts 3D10 points of STR from 
the victim, until death occurs (at STR 0). The byakhee char-
acteristically remains attached with this attack until the victim 
is  drained  of  blood,  unless  the  victim  can  make  a  successful 
opposed STR roll. Escaping death, let the victim rest and regain 
blood (by transfusion as well), at up to 1D10+5 STR per day. A 
Byakhee may hold only one victim at a time.

Do  byakhee  possess  the  ability  to  fold  space?  Some 
conjecture  that  this  power  manifests  via  a  certain 
internal organ, sometimes known as a "hune." There 
are some who would find great interest in the potential 
applications such an organ could have as a weapon or 
method of transport.

Perhaps  a specimen of this organ
