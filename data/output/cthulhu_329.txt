Dagon & Hydra (Unique Beings)

Vast, Polyphemous-like, and loathsome, it darted like a 
stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about 
which it flung its gigantic scaly arms.

—H.P. Lovecraft, Dagon 

Father Dagon and Mother Hydra are deep ones who have 
grown enormously in size and age, each over 20 feet tall and 
perhaps millions of years old. They rule the deep ones and 
lead  them  in  their  worship  of  Cthulhu.  This  pair  is  active 
and mobile, unlike Cthulhu and his minions, but are rarely 
met.  Dagon  and  Hydra’s  characteristics  are  identical.  It  is 
possible  that  more  than  two  deep  ones  have  grown  to  the

The  worship  of  Dagon  by  humanity  appears  to  be 
ancient,  with  many  cults  flourishing  and  dying  out 
throughout  history.  Often  hidden  behind  a  benign 
façade,  such  cults  operate  in  public  with  only  the 
members  of  the  inner  circle  aware  of  the  true  nature 
and purpose of the cult. 

The  Phoenicians,  Sumerians,  Cannanites,  and 
Philistines  all  appear  to  have  revered  a  fertility  god 
named  Dagon  or  Dagan.  The  Dogon  People  of  Mali 
revere amphibious, fishlike ancestor spirits who came 
to Earth in the distant past, as twins from an invisible 
star, whose return will herald a new age.

Order of Dagon, popular with the residents
