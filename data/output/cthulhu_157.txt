chapter 7: chasesBrian, Scott and Harvey are sitting drinking in their apartment one evening, when three cultists turn up at their door. 
The three investigators decide to flee via the window, knowing the door will not hold the cultists back for long. The Keeper 
establishes whether the investigators are all traveling in the same direction or splitting up; the players decide to head in 
the same direction. There will only be one chase.

The Keeper asks for a speed roll (CON) roll for each character. The investigators have to climb out of the window, 
while the cultists are delayed with breaking the door down. Both sides have an impediment, so neither side is given a 
bonus or penalty die for the speed roll.

Harvey (MOV 6): fails the CON roll: MOV 5 (6-1).
Brian (MOV 8): passes the CON roll: MOV 8.
Scott (MOV 9): passes the CON roll with an Extreme success: MOV 10 (9+1).
Cultist A (MOV 8): fails the CON roll: MOV 7 (8-1).
Cultist B (MOV 8): fails the CON roll: MOV 7 (8-1).
Cultist C (MOV 8): passes the CON roll with an Extreme success: MOV 9 (8+1).

Scott has a higher speed than any of his pursuers and escapes (unless he decides to hang around to help his buddies).
Brian and Harvey are heading in the same direction as Scott, but as their speed does not exceed that of the cultists, 

they may be caught. Thus, the chase is on!
Pursuing cultists in speed order:
Cultist A (7), Cultist B (7), Cultist C (9)

Fleeing investigators in speed order:
Harvey (5), Brian (8), Scott (10).

1. Place the pursuers: The Keeper begins by noting the slowest pursuers (Cultists A and B), are at the back of the chase, 
while 2 locations in front of them is Cultist C (speed 9 – speed 7 = a gap of 2 locations).
2. Place the fleeing characters: The gap between the fastest pursuer (Cultist C) and the slowest quarry (Harvey) is set to 
the default of 2 locations. Brian’s speed is 3 more than Harvey’s, so he begins 3 locations ahead of Harvey (unless Brian 
chooses to hang back to help his friend).

3. Position hazards: The Keeper sets up the chase with the investigators having fled their apartment though the window, 
now being pursued down an alleyway.
