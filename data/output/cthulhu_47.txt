chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORS50 

Call of Cthulhu51 

chapter 3: CREATING INVESTIGATORShis chapter looks at skills in detail, providing 
definitions  of  their  use  and  scope  within  the 
game.  Each  category  of  skill  encompasses  a 
range  of  possibilities  and,  to  ensure  brevity, 
descriptions have to be general summaries of 
intent and coverage. 

Skill Definitions
Skills  represent  what  is  known  within  a  certain  era,  and 
some  skills  are  tagged  [Modern]  to  denote  that  they  can 
only be used in modern-day settings. Some skills are given 
a  generic  name,  which  may  not  be  appropriate  for  some 
settings; for example, Drive Auto would not be suitable for 
a  game  set  in Victorian  London,  and  should  be  reworded 
appropriately—in this case as Drive Carriage.

Skill percentiles are not proportions of what is hypothet-
ically  knowable.  If  they  were  able  to  stack  their  respective 
knowledge on a table like poker chips and measure the dif-
ference, a physicist of 60% in the modern day knows much 
more than a physicist of 90% skill in 1910. 

Equally, some skills would be affected by location. A Jap-
anese investigator might have a Law skill of 75% in Japan; 
however if the same investigator were tested on Spanish law 
then the Keeper would probably increase the level of diffi-
culty of the roll.

A skill level of 50% is high enough to let a character eke 
out a living from it. If an investigator rises high in a skill un-
related to their profession, player and Keeper could confer 
about changing the investigator to a
