 
rating to speed is not linear. Each point of MOV equates with 
an approximate increase in speed of around 50%. 

The  MOV  rating  of  a  creature  is  not  necessarily  their 
maximum  speed  over  a  short  distance,  but  is  intended  to 
represent their overall speed in a chase. For example, a world 
class sprinter can achieve MOV 11 over 100 meters, but 12 

MPH  (MOV  9)  would  be  a  more  realistic  speed  for  a  fit 
human over distance, equating to a 5-minute mile.

Chases with Multiple Characters
When running a chase with multiple characters, the only sig-
nificant difference lies in the initial phase; see Establishing the 
Chase (page 132).

First,  decide  who  is  chasing  whom  and  whether  the 
fleeing characters are staying together or splitting up. If they 
split up there will be multiple chases and each chase should 
be tracked and resolved separately.

Each  character  involved  in  a  chase  makes  a  speed  roll 
(using either Drive Auto or CON) to establish their MOV 
rate  for  the  chase  (see  Speed  roll,  page  132).  Once  this  is 
done, list the participants of the chase in speed order in their 
two groups: pursuers and fleeing characters.
Next, eliminate those not in the chase:
Any  fleeing  characters  who  are  faster  than  their  fastest 

pursuer may escape the chase entirely if they wish to.

Any  pursuers  who  are  slower  than  the  slowest  fleeing 
character are left behind, and do not participate in the case.
The  two  groups  are  now  positioned  in  order  of  their 

MOV ratings.

pursuer, right at the back of the chase. Then 
place each of the other pursuers a number 
of  locations  ahead  of  him  or  her,  equal  to 
their  difference  in  MOV  speeds.  Once  all 
of  the  pursuers  are  placed,  move  onto  the 
fleeing characters.

2.  Place  the  fleeing  characters:  As  with  a 
one-on-one  chase,  position  a  fleeing  char-
acter  (the  slowest  one)  2  locations  ahead 
of  the  foremost  pursuer.  Then  place  each 
of the other fleeing characters a number of 
locations ahead of slowest fleeing character, 
equal to their difference in MOV speeds.

3.  Position  hazards:  Note  down  any  haz-
ards, barriers, or other landmarks.

4.  Movement  actions:  Determine  how 
many movement actions each character has.

5. Determine DEX order: List participants 
in DEX order, fastest to slowest.

Examples

Minor incident: 
Most Regular 
Hazards. May be 
cosmetic damage 
only, possibly 
something serious.

Moderate incident: 
Most Hard Hazards. 
Might cause major 
damage. Might 
wreck a car..

Severe incident: 
Most Extreme Haz-
ards. Likely to wreck 
a car outright.

Mayhem: Likely 
to wreck a truck 
outright. Almost 
certain to wreck a 
car.

Road kill: Most 
vehicles will be little 
more than scattered 
debris.
