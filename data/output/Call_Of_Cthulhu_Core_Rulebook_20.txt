 out of print and into celluloid. Today, numerous 
feature and short films have been made based upon HPL’s 
stories. Notably, Stuart Gordon’s Re-Animator (a modern 
telling of "Herbert West—Reanimator") and Dagon (a con-

Call of Cthulhutemporary reworking of “The Shadow Over Innsmouth”) 
have helped bring HPL to mainstream cinema. Directors 
including John Carpenter, Frank Darabont, Guillermo del 
Toro,  and  Sam  Raimi  have  all  incorporated  Lovecraftian 
themes and references within their work.

The Cthulhu Mythos
It is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably 
with darkness, silence, and solitude.

—H. P. Lovecraft, Cool Air

the 

Lovecraft once wrote, “All my tales are based 
upon  the  fundamental  premise  that 
common  human  laws  and  inter-
ests and emotions have no va-
lidity or significance in the 
vast  cosmos  at-large.” 
He  further  imagined 
funda-
that 
truths 
mental 
of 
the  universe 
were  so  alien  and 
that 
horrifying 
mere 
exposure 
to 
them  might 
result  in  madness 
or  suicide.  While 
humanity  might 
crave  both  com-
fort and the truth, 
only  one  or  the 
other  was  possi-
ble.  The  human 
in-
is  an 
mind 
flexible  container. 
It  cannot  maintain 
cosmic 
truth 
complete  sanity—more 
of one poured in must spill 
out more of the other. Humans 
desperate  for  the  power  cloaked 
within  truth  might  choose  to  forgo  all 
remnants  of  sanity  in  exchange  for  becoming 
adept at manipulating the secrets of time and space. Their 
devil’s  bargains  made,  these  merciless  sorcerers  would 
whistle  down  devastation  and  doom  to  this  world  in  ex-
change for yet more knowledge and power.

and 

Lovecraft’s  working-out  of  these  ideas  in  his  fiction 
became known as the Cthulhu Mythos. The term encom-
passes a complex and broad group of sometimes contra-
dictory  narratives,  stories,  essays,  letters,  and  deductions, 
so extensive as to be impossible to summarize in detail—
and not the least because new Mythos material continues 
to be written around the world. Adding to the confusion, 
one of his perceptions was that the truly alien is genuinely 
unknowable.  The  Mythos  becomes  not  just  mysterious, 
but protean and contradictory; not only do we not know 

it, we never can know it. As it transpires, we have only our 
own names for most of these things. We do not even know 
their “real” names for themselves, or if they have names.

A General Summary 
Though  their  interrelations  are  obscure,  we  know  that 
some entities of the Cthulhu Mythos are clearly superior or 
inferior in their powers. Gods are the mightiest, followed 
(at some distance, apparently) by the Great Old Ones. 

Depending  on  which  author  one  reads,  the  universe 
is  ruled  by  beings  variously  known  as  the  Elder  Gods, 
Outer Gods, or Other Gods. Only a few of these deities 
are known by name. The majority are both 
blind  and  idiotic  in  human  terms. 
They  are  all  extremely  powerful 
alien  beings  and  some  may 
be of extra-cosmic origin. 
The  Outer  Gods  rule 
the universe and have 
little  to  do  with 
humanity,  except 
for  Nyarlathotep. 
Humans  med-
dling  with  these 
entities  suffer
