 new life in the sea.

The physical changes are accompanied by an awakening 
of new senses, strange dreams of undersea cities, and a long-
ing to visit seaside locales—particularly ancestral homes or 
the individual’s birth place. 

Typically, hybrids inhabit remote coastal villages, how-
ever  they  can  be  found  further  afield  (particularly  in  the 
early stages of their transformation). As the final transfor-
mations take place the hybrid either learns to embrace their 
monstrous heritage or goes mad in the process.

Deep ones will attempt to lure hybrids to their lairs or 
places of safety, where they can supervise the final metamor-
phosis  and  ensure  the  hybrid  is  appropriately  schooled  in 
their  shared  heritage. About  10%  of  hybrids  do  not  com-

plete the transformation and are doomed to spend the rest 
of their life as a half-human half-deep one, while a further 
10%  do  not  undergo  the  metamorphosis  at  all,  with  the 
deep  one  genes  essentially  missing  a  generation—only  to 
manifest in a future descendent.

SPECIAL POWERS 

Breathe underwater: Hybrids are unable to breathe under-
water until they have undergone the full change into a deep 
one; however, from early childhood onwards they can remain 
underwater for up to twice as long as the average human.

Spells:  Older  hybrids  who  have  begun  to  embrace  their 
watery heritage have a 10% chance of knowing 1D3 spells.

Dhole

Below him the ground was festering with gigantic Dholes, 
and even as he looked, one reared up several hundred feet and 
levelled a bleached, viscous end at him.

—H.P. Lovecraft and E. Hoffman Price,  
Through the Gate of the Silver Key

Dholes are gigantic wormlike burrowing horrors. They are 
not native to the Earth and none seem to have been brought 
here for more than brief periods, fortunately, for they seem 
to have riddled and laid waste to several other worlds. They 
dislike light, though it does not visibly harm them. They are 
only rarely seen in daylight, and then only on planets that 
they  have  thoroughly  conquered.  Some  unknown  relation 
between dholes and chthonians may exist. Similar creatures, 
bholes, exist in the Dreamlands.
