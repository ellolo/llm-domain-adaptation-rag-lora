 from where it emerges.

Cult
A few pockets of cultists worship this obscure entity, gener-
ally in subterranean temples, and especially during equinox-
es,  solstices,  and  important  conjunctions.  Tulzscha  thrives 
on death, corruption, and decay.

Tsathoggua

like head with bat-like ears and fur. His mouth is wide and 
his eyes always are half-closed, as if sleepy. It is also said that 
he can freely change his shape.

Cult
Tsathoggua was worshiped by serpent people and the furry 
subhuman voormis in ancient times, and by sorcerers and 
wizards in later times. He has given magic gates and spells 
to the faithful in the past. He is served by a race of entities 
known,  for  lack  of  a  better  name,  as  the  formless  spawn. 
They dwell in N’Kai and in his temples.

Other Characteristics
When encountered, ask for a group Luck roll from the inves-
tigators to determine if Tsathoggua is hungry. If Tsathoggua 
is not hungry, he ignores the investigators and pretends to 
be asleep.

ATTACKS

Fighting attacks: Tsathoggua may kick and strike opponents.
Hold and feed (mnvr): If hungry, Tsathoggua grabs an investiga-
tor and pulls the victim to him: in each following round the 
character loses 5 points from each characteristic until they are 
reduced to zero or until Tsathoggua is driven off. The victim 
will be in great agony, with acid burns, vitriol running through 
his veins, body punctures everywhere, etc. In this case (if the 
investigator somehow manages to live and escape) a full week 
of hospital care restores one point to each characteristic.
