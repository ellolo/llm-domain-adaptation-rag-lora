Zombie

The spell creating the zombie supplies the points 
of POW motivating it. Each spell-caster directs 
what he or she creates: zombies, in the main, 

have no will of their own.

As  the  Keeper  wishes,  a  few  spells  and 
substances  may  deactivate  these  things. 
According  to  voodoo  tradition,  zombies 
could be destroyed by feeding them salt; 
their  makers  would  first  sew  shut  their 
mouths to guard against this. 

In addition to the voodoo tradition, 
Keepers  should  note  the  Resurrection 
spell  within  the  Cthulhu  Mythos  tra-
dition—a  means  of  resurrecting  the 
dead (which seem mostly in control 
of  their  faculties),  and  the  new 
rationales  that  weird  science,  or  vile 

pollution might also create zombie-like things.

Section Four: Beasts
A comprehensive guide to all the varieties of animals 
in the world is clearly beyond the scope of this book 
and  would  be  quite  unnecessary  for  play.  The  an-
imals  listed  below  are  those  that  feature  as  foes  in 
stories of the horror genre (think of Hitchcock’s The 
Birds) or those that might be utilized by the investi-
gators (such as horses as mounts).
