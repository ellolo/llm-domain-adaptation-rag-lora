chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsNightgaunt
Shocking and uncouth black things with smooth, 
oily, whale-like surfaces, unpleasant horns that 
curved inward toward each other, bat wings 
whose beating made no sound, ugly prehensile 
paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly 
and disquietingly. And worst of all, they 
never spoke or laughed, and never smiled 
because they had no faces at all to smile 
with, but only a suggestive blankness 
where a face ought to be. All they ever 
did was clutch and fly and tickle; that 
was the way of nightgaunts.
—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dream-Quest 
of Unknown Kadath

Nightgaunts  are  creatures  of  the  Dreamlands  that  serve 
Nodens by, among other things, grasping and carrying off 
intruders,  who  are  unceremoniously  dumped  in  the  most 
dismal and horrible places imaginable, and left to die. Night-
gaunts are stationed at various spots in the lonely parts of 
the Dreamlands, coming out at night to seek their prey. 

In  primeval  times  they  dwelled  in  the  Waking  World 
as well, and some suggest that may still be the case. While 
not very intelligent, nightgaunts can understand some lan-
guages (such as the gibberings of ghouls) and are friendly to 
some occult races.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 1
Fighting attacks: They attack with their paws, tail, horns, or limbs. 
Seize  (mnvr):  Nightgaunts  favor  seizing  their  opponents  after 
which they can tickle them with their barbed tail. Nightgaunts 
usually attack en masse, attempting to sneak up quietly on vic-
tims, grasp their weapons, and overpower them. Two or more 
nightgaunts may combine their attacks to get hold of a strong 
victim (potentially granting the outnumbered bonus die).
Tickle:  Nightgaunts  may  only  tickle  foes  who  have  already  been 
seized. A successful tickling attack is extremely unnerving, for 
the bar
