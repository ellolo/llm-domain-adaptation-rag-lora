 possible for the investigators to beat some monsters 
in combat. Against others, their only chance of survival is gen-
erally to flee or hide. Deep ones, byakhees, dimensional sham-
blers, fire vampires, ghasts, ghouls, servants of Gla'aki, mi-go, 
moon-beasts,  nightgaunts,  rat-things,  sand-dwellers,  serpent 
people, insects from Shagghai, tcho-tcho, and of course human 
cultists can all be "taken on" in combat by several investigators 
with  some  hope  of  success.  This  is  the  reason  that  so  many 
scenarios feature cultists, deep ones, mi-go, and ghouls—they 
make  approximately  human-scale  adversaries.  Such  Mythos 
entities can, on first reflection, appear human-like in terms of 
their vulnerability and relative size; yet beware of humanizing 
such monsters. As stated, their goals, knowledge, and abilities 
should be difficult, if not impossible, to fathom. They will act in 
unexpected ways and the mere sight of them can draw madness 
down upon the inquisitive investigator.

etc.
