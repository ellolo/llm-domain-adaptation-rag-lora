Crocodile
The  Nile  crocodile,  now  rare 
in  the  lower  Nile  but  still 
found 
Madagascar, 
Asia  and  north-
ern  and  western 
Australia. Where 
there 
is  water 
there  may  be 
crocodiles.  Crocs  eat 
anything they can catch and come in great numbers to a 
kill to feed communally. Usually they will not attack a boat. 
Similar stats may be used for any crocodilia, including alli-
gators,  caimans,  and  gavials—all  long-snouted,  lizard-like, 
and carnivorous.
