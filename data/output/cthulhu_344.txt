ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 2 (the Lightning Gun may only be fired once 

each round).

Fighting  attacks:  In  combat,  a  member  of  this  race  may  use  its 
pincers to attack. It also possesses great size that it may use to 
crush or hit an investigator. However, this civilized race avoids 
hand-to-hand combat, preferring weapons that fire great gouts 
of electricity—weapons that were originally created to destroy 
the flying polyps.

Lightning Gun: There are many varieties of Lightning Guns (see 
page 272). A common one contains a pack of 32 charges and 
takes  1  round  to  reload.  As  many  charges  as  desired  may  be 
fired as a single shot, however each charge past 4 fired at once 
gives a 5% accumulating chance of burning-out the gun. Thus, 
if 7 charges were fired at once, 
the gun would be ruined on 
a  separate  1D100  result  of 
15 or less.

Yithian

Each  charge  does  1D10  points 
of  damage  to  the  target,  so 
that 3 charges would do 3D10 
points of damage. The gun has 
a  basic  range  of  100  yards. 
For  each  100  yards  fired 
past  that  base  apply  one 
penalty die to the roll to hit.

made  the  Great  Race.  They  taught  their  young  their  own 
technology  and  culture.  Those  young  grew  up  as  true  in-
heritors of the mentalists and the new bodies were natural 
to them. In the aeons that followed, the Great Race divided 
the Earth between themselves, the mi-go, and Cthulhu’s kin. 
Cthulhu  and  his  kind  ruled  from  the  Pacific  and  the  lost 
lands  of  R’lyeh  and  Mu.  The  mi-go  controlled  the  North, 
while  in  the  south  the  Great  Race  were  supreme.  Their 
greatest city was Pnakotus, in modern-day Australia.

This  race  flourished  from  about  four  hundred  million 
years ago until fifty million years ago, when they were
