Shark
Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your 
eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got...lifeless eyes, 
black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem 
to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over 
white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch 
screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' 
and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. 

—Peter Benchley, Jaws

Dangerous  and  feared  through  all  the  world’s  oceans  by 
humanity and sea-creatures alike, these predators have been 
called the perfect killing machine. These statistics are for a 
generic example shark, for a larger shark increase SIZ, STR, 
and CON. 

The more common types of sharks are bull, great white 
and  hammerhead,  and  these  sharks  vary  greatly  in  size, 
temperament and appearance. Sharkskin is extremely tough 
and covered with tiny enamel “teeth," and sharks are often 
hunted for their skin.
