Damage Bonus
Lower damage bonuses have been changed in 7th Edition.

Hit Points
In 7th Edition, hit points are derived by adding CON + SIZ and di-
viding by 10, rounding down. Thus, a cultist with CON 60 + SIZ 
65 totals 125 divided by 10, yielding 12.5. He has 12 hit points.

In earlier editions, hit points were the average of CON + 
SIZ, rounded up. The same cultist would have CON 12 + SIZ 
13, averaged to 12.5 and rounded up to 13 hit points.

Thus, some enemies and non-player characters may have 
1 hit point fewer in 7th Edition than in previous editions. It 
is  recommended  that  the  Keeper  ignore  this  difference  for 
monsters and enemies.

Build 
7th Edition introduces Build, which is used when determining 
fighting maneuvers and also chases, and is derived from STR 
and SIZ (see Damage Bonus and Build, page 33).

Movement Rate 
In 6th Edition, all human movement rates are the same (8), 
whereas 7th Edition introduces scaled movement values (see 
Movement Rate, page 33). It is recommended (for simplici-
ty) that the Keeper uses the movement values as given when 
using material written for previous editions.

Skill Pool
Many  of  the  skills  remain  unchanged  and  the  values  can 
simply  be  transferred  to  the  7th  Edition  investigator  sheet. 
Where points were spent in a skill that no longer exists, these 
points should be recorded in a Skill Pool for later distribution. 
When adding points to the skill pool, take care not to include 
the Base Values (note that some base values have changed 
between editions). 

This  pool  is  redistributed  among  the  7th  Edition  skills 
with the aim of creating a similar character. When distributing 
the skill pool, consider spending points in the new 7th Edition 
skills, especially Charm and Intimidate.

Some skills from previous editions have been amalgamated. 
This was done where a skill in one area would clearly confer 
a higher level of skill in a related area, such as with rifle and 
shotgun. The two weapons are different in many respects, but 
someone  who  is  proficient  with  a  shotgun  will  have  a  great 
advantage over an untrained person when using a rifle. 

Rifle and Shotgun were previously two separate skills, 
but have now been amalgamated. 6th Edition Archie 
has  Rifle  40%  and  Shotgun  70%.  The  6th  Edition 
base  values  were  Rifle  25%  and  Shotgun  30%.  Ar-
chie’s Rifle skill has been raised by 15%, his shotgun 
skill by 40%. 

The base value for Archie’s 7th Edition skill Fire-
arms  (Rifle/Shotgun)  is  25%,  to  which  is  added  the 
greater  of  the  two  values  (40%)  to  give  a  Firearms 
(Rifle/Shotgun)  skill  of  65%. The  15%  that  was  left 
unused is added to Archie’s Skill Pool.

chapter 16: APPENDICESAny  skill  points  that  have  been  pooled  as  a  result  of 
amalgamated or removed skills should now be distributed as 
the player sees fit. The Keeper may wish to enforce a cap of 
75% on starting skills. 

With the Keeper’s permission, some points may be trans-
ferred between skills to adjust or balance an investigator if 
required.
