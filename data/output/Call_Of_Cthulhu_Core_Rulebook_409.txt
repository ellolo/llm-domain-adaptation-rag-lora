ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 4
Fighting attacks: Thrashing tentacles bash anything nearby. It will 

use maneuvers to seize and bite its prey.

Seize (mnvr): Can seize a victim with one of its eight tentacles. The 
first tentacle striking a foe hangs on; when a second connects, 
the  two  constrict  the  target  and  each  does  its  damage  each 
round.

Bite:  Once  seized  by  a  tentacle  the  victim  may  be  bitten  by  the 
creature’s  poisonous  beak.  Victims  must  make  an  Extreme 
CON  roll  to  resist  the  full  effect  of  the  poison  (see  Poisons, 
page 128). If not resisted the poison causes 1D6 damage and a 
penalty die on all future actions for several hours.

chapter 14: monsters, beasts, and alien godsWasp and Bee Swarms
A cloud of stinger-equipped, flying insects attacks for 2D6 
combat rounds before halting pursuit. Unless the victims are 
completely covered (as with netting or by being enclosed in 
an automobile or by diving underwater), there is no protec-
tion against them. An investigator who is stung extensively 
and whose player fails a CON roll may experience profound 
immune system shock, fall seriously ill, and (rarely) die.

The Africanized bees presently colonizing the Americas 
are  more  intent  in  their  pursuit  than  are  honey  bees  or 
wasps,  attacking  for  up  to  3D6  minutes.  Being  seriously 
stung  by  these  so-called  killer  bees  occasionally  results  in 
death, since the attacks are comparatively unrelenting and 
often  more  numerous.  Each  minute  of  such  attack  might 
cost as much as 1D6 hit points.

Wolf
They may hunt in packs when dogging herds of elk or cari-
bou; they as often hunt singly or in family pairings.

Wolves are normally shy and verified attacks on healthy 

humans are said to be rare or non-existent.
