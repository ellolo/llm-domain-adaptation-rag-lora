 skills should now be distributed as 
the player sees fit. The Keeper may wish to enforce a cap of 
75% on starting skills. 

With the Keeper’s permission, some points may be trans-
ferred between skills to adjust or balance an investigator if 
required.

Credit Rating
If your character already has a recorded value for their wealth, 
this may remain unchanged. Otherwise, figure your investi-
gator’s  wealth  according  to  their  Credit  Rating  score—see 
Cash and Assets, page 46.

Combat Skills (Kick, Punch, Head 
Butt, Grapple, Knife, and Club)
Each unarmed attack had its own individual skill in previous 
editions.  These  have  now  been  amalgamated  into  one  skill: 
Fighting (Brawl). If your investigator is up close with some-
one, a head-butt might be the most appropriate form of attack. 
If the target is on the ground, a kick might be more fitting. The 
player is encouraged to choose a form of attack that fits the 
situation rather than tactically using their highest skill.

Basic  weapons,  such  as  clubs  and  knives,  are  now  in-
cluded  in  the  Fighting  (Brawl)  skill.  If  your  investigator  is 
attacked,  he  or  she  may  grab  a  kitchen  knife  in  preference 
to being unarmed, but would they do so if it meant using a 
lower skill value? A skilled fighter is likely to be able to put 
any knife or club to good use.

Converting Non-Player 
Characters, Gods, Beasts 
and Monsters
Human NPCs that are fully detailed may be converted using 
the same rules as for investigators (above). Usually NPCs are 
less detailed than investigators and may be converted using 
the guidelines for monsters.

Characteristics: Characteristic scores from previous editions 
are simply multiplied by five to provide 7th Edition values. 
Since characteristics for NPCs and monsters are mostly used 
for setting the difficulty level for players’ skill rolls, there is no 
need to record the half and fifth values.

Skills: Most NPCs and monsters have only a limited number 
of  skills  listed,  which  for  the  most  part  can  remain  for  7th 
Edition use. If the character has skills no longer used in 7th 
Edition then assign the value to a comparable skill. 

Fighting skill: Many beings have multiple attack values listed 
and, for the most part, these should be amalgamated into one 
Fighting skill. Review the listed attacks and use the highest 
for the creature’s Fighting skill. Punch is the only exception to

this, since it previously began at 50% in the case of human 
NPCs, so reduce their punch skill by 25% to create balance.
