 
victim takes 1 point of damage from constriction—the damage 
done  per  round  progressively  increasing  by  1  point  (e.g.,  on 
the second round 2 points of damage are taken, and so forth). 
While  swallowed,  the  victim  may  take  no  action  whatsoever, 
though friends may attempt to slay the monster to free him or 
her. A formless spawn can make one Bite attack per round and 
can continue to swallow prey until having swallowed its own 
SIZ  in  prey. While  digesting  a  victim,  a  spawn  may  continue 
to fight but may not shift location without disgorging what it 
has swallowed.

Grab  (mnvr):  Grabs  an  opponent  using  one  of  its  whip  like 
appendages; range is always one-fifth of the monster’s SIZ in 
yards.

Fighting 60% (30/12), damage 2D6 + damage bonus 
Grab (mnvr) damage 1D6 + damage bonus 
Bite 30% (15/6), damage swallowed 
Dodge 47% (23/9)
Armor: Immune to all physical weapons, even enchanted ones—
wounds  simply  snap  closed  after  being  opened.  Spells  may 
affect them, as may fire, chemicals, or other forces.
Sanity Loss: 1/1D10 Sanity points to see a formless spawn.

Formless Spawn

Ghast

Repulsive beings which die in the light…and leap on long 
hind legs…a pair of yellowish red eyes…Ghasts have indeed 
an excellent sense of smell…something about the size of a 
small horse hopped out into the grey twilight, and Carter 
turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome 
beast, whose face is so curiously human despite the absence 
of a nose, a forehead, and other particulars…They spoke in 
coughing gutturals.

—H. P. Lovecraft, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath

Ghasts  are  restricted  to  the  underworld  and  vast  caverns 
where  sunlight  never  comes.  Exposed  to  direct  sunlight, 
they sicken and eventually die. Ghasts are cannibalistic and 
eat one another as well as other beings they catch.

The  horrible,  semi-human  bipeds  ridden  by  the  high-
ly-scientific but morally-degenerate humans inhabiting the 
cavern of K’n-Yan may be relatives of, or even be examples 
of, ghasts. If this is the case, then ghasts are likely the result 
of serpent people genetic experimentation. Ghasts are evi-
dently tamable, though primitive and savage.

Ghast

Ghoul

These figures were seldom completely human, but often 
approached humanity in varying degree. Most of the bodies, 
while roughly bipedal, had a forward slumping, and a 
vaguely canine cast.
