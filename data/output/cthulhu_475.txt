 concern for many players!

Characteristics
The  decision  was  taken  to  unify  characteristics  and  skills; 
both are now on a comparable percentage scale. The inten-
tion is to make it easier to compare and make opposed rolls 
using a mixture of skills and characteristics.

The aim is for all of the math to be done when creating an 
investigator rather than in the middle of a game. You do not 
have to write all of the half and fifth values on the investigator 
sheet, however we’ve found that doing so speeds up play, es-
pecially when players are asked to make a roll and announce 
the level of success.

The decision was made to divorce Luck from POW since 
the latter is of great significance elsewhere in the game. For 
that reason Luck is now rolled randomly (3D6 x 5).

EDU is no longer the only characteristic used to generate 
Occupational  Skill  Points.  Some  characters  may  have  a  low 
level of education but be extremely proficient in some of the 
less academic skills. This also lends more value to APP in the 
game.

We considered the option of associating a characteristic 
with each skill (as with Dodge and DEX) but decided against 
this  approach.  The  idea  is  sound  enough:  it  makes  perfect 
sense for one’s base skill in Charm to be one-fifth of Appear-
ance, for example. We decided against this approach for three 
reasons:

i Using characteristic values introduces additional work 

during investigator creation.

i One-fifth of a characteristic will be between 3 and 18. 
If it is a skill in which you are likely to spend points, 
the  benefit  of  using  one-fifth  of  the  characteristic 
did not seem significant enough to justify the added 
complication.

i  The characteristics feed into skill points to a limited 
degree.  A  variety  of  characteristics  are  used  to  cal-
culate skill points, depending on your investigator’s 
chosen occupation.

We chose to keep the link between Dodge and DEX, since 

it has always been that way.

characteristics  (see  note  following)  of  previous  editions 
now provide the one-fifth values. Multiply these by five for 
the full values and divide this new value by two, rounding 
down, for the one-half value. 

Luck points and hit points may be left unchanged. The 
SAN characteristic served only to set starting Sanity points 
and is no longer recorded as a characteristic.

Education  (EDU)  scores  higher  than  18  required  addi-

tional modification, as per Table XVI: EDU Conversion.

Age
Previous editions contained rules for aging and, while these 
vary a little from 7th Edition rules, there is no need to redo 
the  effects  of  age.  Damage  bonus  will  remain  unaltered, 
however  the  movement  rate  (see  Movement  Rate,  page 
33)  should  be  checked  and  Build  should  be  added  (see 
Damage Bonus and Build, page 33).

Hit Points
In 7th Edition, hit points are derived by adding CON + SIZ and di-
