Poison Potency
In  earlier  versions  of  Call  of  Cthulhu,  each  poison  had  a 
Potency  (POT)  value.  The  higher  the  POT  value,  the  more 
deadly  the  poison.  Use  this  reckoner  to  convert  old  POT 
values to the poison bands.

Tomes
Each tome has a value that denotes the number of Cthulhu 
Mythos  skill  points  that  are  gained  when  a  character  reads 
the book. In 7th Edition, the total amount of Cthulhu Mythos 
points  remains  unchanged,  but  is  divided  into  two  values: 
Cthulhu Mythos Initial (CMI) for an initial reading of the book 
(akin to “skim reading”), and Cthulhu Mythos Full (CMF) for 
a proper, full reading and study of the text. 

To  figure  the  two  values,  simply  divide  the  6th  Edition 
Cthulhu Mythos value of the tome by three and round down; 
this  is  the  amount  of  points  gained  for  an  initial  reading 
(CMI). The remainder of the points are those gained for a full 
study reading (CMF).

In  6th  Edition,  the  Eltdown  Shards  has  a  Cthulhu 
Mythos  +11%.  Divided  by  three,  this  gives  a  value 
+3%  for  the  initial  reading,  and  +8%  for  the  full 
study (+3%/+8%).

Conclusion
Call of Cthulhu was created over 30 years ago by Sandy Pe-
tersen. There have been very few changes in those 30 years. 
The aim of this new edition is to retain the aspects that made 
Call  of  Cthulhu  so  much  fun  to  play  and  at  the  same  time 
introduce some new rules that provide the Keeper and players 
with additional ways to create drama and excitement, such as 
the ability to push rolls and run chase scenes. 
We hope that you enjoy this new edition.
