  Chapter  14:  Monsters,  Beasts  and 
Alien Gods.

The servants have weaknesses and can be destroyed. If 
exposed to sunlight, Turner and his gang should have one 
penalty  applied  to  all  their  actions  per  hour  of  exposure. 
Only spending time spent in the blue stone caskets can al-
leviate  the  spread  of  the  green  decay. After  three  hours  of 
constant sunlight their bodies disintegrate forever.

Turner  has  been  especially  blessed  by  Gla'aki  and  is  a 

little more powerful than the average Servant.

AUGUST, JACOB, VINCENT & LOUIS, Turner’s gang, Ser-
vants of Gla'aki

They appear as horribly decayed humans. For convenience, 
use the standard values for a Servant of Gla'aki (see Chapter 
14: Monsters, Beasts and Alien Gods) or you may wish to 
draw up unique values for each. Keepers looking to increase 
the  lethality  of  the  servants  presented  are  encouraged  to 
increase the Gang’s CON and DEX levels.

Each is armed with a knife or similar tool.

Sanity Loss: 1/1D8 sanity points to see August, Jacob, Louis and 

Vincent.

Strong's Survey Team, Servants of Gla'aki

Carl, James, Dean and Richard have recently been made into 
undead  servants  of  Gla'aki.  They  still  appear  human.  Use 
the standard values for a Servant of Gla'aki (see Chapter 14: 
Monsters, Beasts and Alien Gods) or you may wish to draw 
up unique values for each. 

Each is armed with a knife or similar tool.

Sanity Loss: None to see these seemingly human servants, though 

if inspected more closely 1/1D8.
