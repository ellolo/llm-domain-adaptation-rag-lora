Key
MOV:  A  rating  of  the  vehicle’s  speed  and  maneuverability 
in  chases.  These  ratings  are  for  modern  vehicles  and  may  be 
reduced by around 20% for 1920s vehicles (though there were 
cars in the 1920s that could exceed 100 MPH).

reduced  to  zero,  the  vehicle  is  out  of  action.  Each  full  10  hit
