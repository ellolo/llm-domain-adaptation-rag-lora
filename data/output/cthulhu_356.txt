Servitor of the Outer Gods
Toad-like creatures which seemed constantly to be changing 
shape and appearance, and from whom emanated, by some 
means I could not distinguish, a ghastly ululation, a piping.
— August Derleth, The Lurker at the Threshold

Vaguely resembling frogs, as well as squids or octopi, these 
amorphous beings progress by rolling, slithering, or lurch-
ing. Their ever-changing shapes are a blasphemous contor-
tion, making description somewhat difficult. 

Servitors accompany their masters as required, though they 
are most commonly found in Azathoth’s court. These are the 
demon flautists that play the flute-like music for their masters
