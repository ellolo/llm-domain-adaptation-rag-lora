Acronyms:

Skill: Skill required to use the weapon.

Damage:  Roll  the  dice  indicated  to  determine  weapon’s 
damage.  When  an  Extreme  success  is  achieved  with  an 
attack roll the damage is increased. For the purpose of de-
termining  increased  damage  weapons  are  divided  into  two 
groups: impaling and non-impaling. Non-impaling weapons 
deliver maximum damage (plus maximum damage bonus if 
applicable). It is important to note that only those initiating 
an attack deal greater damage with an Extreme success; any 
successful  attacks  made  as  a  result  of  fighting  back  do  not 

deal increased damage, even on an Extreme success.

(i): Indicates a weapon category or specific weapon which can 
impale.  On  an  Extreme  level  of  success  an  impale  has  been 
inflicted: maximum damage (plus maximum damage bonus 
for  melee  weapons)  and  add  a  damage  roll  for  the  weapon. 
Impales  are  not  applied  as  a  result  of  fighting  back. At  very 
long range, when only an Extreme success will hit the target, 
an impale only occurs with a critical hit (a roll of "01").

Base Range: Standard distance of weapon’s attack. 

Uses per Round: Number of attacks that can be initiated per 
combat round (does not affect number of times a character 
may fight back with a melee weapon). Most firearms may fire 
one bullet without penalty; more bullets up to the maximum 
(shown by the number in brackets) may be fired, but each 
shot is taken with a penalty die. Some weapons have burst or 
full auto capability, when using this, use the automatic fire 
rules.

chapter 16: APPENDICESExplosives, Heavy Weapons, Misc. (i)Bullets in Gun (Magazine): There may be multiple options 
depending on the size of magazine or drum used.

Claymore Mine: The weapon has a cone of fire; allow nom-
inal 120-degree effect.

Cost: Split by 1920s / modern era (modern-day prices reflect 
collectors’ market, 1920s prices do not).

Col. Moran’s Air Rifle: Uses compressed air rather than ex-
plosive propellant, achieving relatively silent operation.

Common in Era: Denotes availability by era. 

Malfunction (Mal): If die roll result equal to or higher than 
the  firing  weapon’s  malfunction  number,  the  shooter  does 
not merely miss—the weapon does not fire.

Rare:  Perhaps  obsolete;  a  fine  specimen  for  collectors  or 
perhaps illegal. 

+DB: Plus damage bonus, which varies by individual. 

Stun: Target may not act for 1D6 rounds (or as the Keeper 
indicates).

Burn: Target must roll Luck to avoid catching on fire. Take 
minimum  damage  on  following  round.  Double  this  each 
round until extinguished (providing target is flammable).

Burst/Full Auto: Some automatic weapons can be switched 
to fire burst or full auto; such firearms are usually unavailable 
to civilians; prices reflect black-market.

1B, 2B: 1 barrel, 2 barrels.
