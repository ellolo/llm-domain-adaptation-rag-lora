A Restless Night
Your sleep is far from restful. You toss and turn from 
side to side, bombarded throughout the hours of dark-
ness by images that you barely recall when you awake. 
Maybe it’s the previous day’s trek through the forest 
that’s influencing this. All you remember are the dark 
trees  surrounding  you,  the  sickly,  yellowing  leaves 
falling  to  the  ground.  You  feel  a  terrible  foreboding. 
Something is out there. Watching. Waiting…

You  wake  feeling  exhausted.  It’s  as  if  you  didn’t 
sleep at all. You suffer one penalty die on any CON 
rolls throughout the next day until you sleep again
