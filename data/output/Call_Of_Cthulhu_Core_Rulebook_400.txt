 devoted 
to  the  study  of  and  exorcism  of  ghosts.  Books  to 
read  as  sources  for  ideas  about  ghosts  include 
The  Haunting  of  Hill  House  (both  the  novel  and 
the  1963  film,  The  Haunting)  by  Shirley  Jackson, 
The Shining by Stephen King, any of William Hope 
Hodgson’s ghost stories (particularly the Carnacki 
the Ghost Finder tales), and the ghost stories of M. 
R. James. Henry James contributes a whole volume 
of ghost stories in his Collected Works and Rudyard 
Kipling  set  some  excellent  tales  of  ghosts  in 
both England and India.

Mummy
These undead beings are similar to intelligent zom-
bies. Some cults keep mummies in their temples as 
guardians. Like zombies, mummies must be hacked 
apart to make them cease action. Contrary to popular 
belief, many mummies lack bandage wrappings and 
can  move  relatively  swiftly.  Some  mummies  cannot 
naturally regenerate magic points.

A mummy has double its human STR, 1.5 times 

its original CON and two-thirds of original DEX.

Because of the bitumen and bandages frequently 
used  to  preserve  them,  fire  is  particularly  effective 
against Egyptian mummies: damage is normal, howev-
er the flames are more difficult to extinguish because of 
the bitumen in the wrappings.

Skeleton, human
Animated skeletons are encountered in a few medieval

Special Powers

Resistant  to  harm:  Dried  bones  are  fairly  brittle, 
snapping  and  splintering  easily  from  a  heavy  blow, 
however no area of a skeleton is more vulnerable than 
any other. Any blow striking a skeleton has a chance 
of destroying it equal to or less than the damage done 
x 5 (as rolled on 1D100). For example, if an axe hit 
a  skeleton  and  did  8  points  damage,  there  would  be 
a 40% chance of destroying the skeleton by shattering 
it. Unless the skeleton shatters, it remains totally un-
damaged.

Apply  one  penalty  die  on  attacks  made 
with an impaling weapon (including bullets), 
since much of the target is simply air.
