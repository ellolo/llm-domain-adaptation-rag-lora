ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 1
Fighting  attacks:  Animated  skeletons  traditionally  use 
weapons rather than striking blows directly, perhaps 
because  they  shatter  so  easily.  Equip  as  desired, 
typically a small club or sword.

Vampire
Every player will be interested in matching wits with these 
bloodsuckers;  however  stories  about  vampires  and  their 
powers  are  so  conflicting  and  contradictory  that  the  in-
dividual  Keeper  must  determine  which  vampire  facts  are 
true in play and which are merely legendary. Here are some 
options:

i  A vampire casts no reflection. 
i  A  vampire  may  have  to  return  to  soil  in  which  it 
originally  was  buried  in  order  to  pass  the  daylight 
hours.

i  The third bite from a vampire causes a character to 

die and then to become one of the undead.
i  A vampire has no special powers in daylight and 
may be unable to move abroad, or be unable to 
move from its coffin.

Special Powers
Once  physical  attacks  have  exceeded  its  hit  points,  the 
vampire  turns  into  smoke  or  mist  at  the  end  of  the 
round  after  which  its  hit  points  reached  zero,  there-
after regenerating hit points at the rate of 1 point per 
round. If, when at zero hit points, a stake is driven 
through its heart the vampire is killed and reduced 
to ashes.

ATTACKS
Attacks per round: 1
Fighting attacks: Vampires have the usual range of unarmed at-

tacks open to humanoids.

Bite:  Depending  on  the  style  of  your  vampire,  the  vampire  may 
have to hold the victim to continue draining its victim’s blood, 
or  the  act  of  biting  may  subdue  the  victim  to  the  vampire’s 
will. Either way the vampire drains 2D10 STR (blood) from the 
victim each round thereafter.

Gaze: If the target fails an opposed POW roll the target is hypno-
tized and can be made to follow simple instructions. If these 
instructions  are  self-destructive,  at  the  start  of  a  round  the 
target’s player may attempt an INT roll to snap out of it.
