Firearms Difficulty 
Levels

The difficulty level of a firearms skill roll is always set accord-
ing to range. 

G  Within base range: Regular difficulty level.
G  Long range (up to twice base range): Hard difficulty 

level.

G  Very  long  range  (up  to  four  times  base  range):  Ex-

treme difficulty level.

Any further modifiers use bonus or penalty dice.
Note: At very long range, when only an Extreme success 
will hit the target, an impale only occurs with a critical hit (a 
roll of 01).

Firearm modifiers

Once the difficulty level of a firearms attack has been set, all 
other factors that lend a distinct advantage or disadvantage 
are taken into account.

G  Target  is  diving  for  cover  (Dodge  roll  success):  one 

penalty die.

G  Target is partially concealed: one penalty die.
G  Point-blank  range  (within  fifth  DEX  in  feet):  one 

bonus die.

G  Aiming (for one round): one bonus die.
G  Fast-moving target (MOV 8+): one penalty die.
G  Target is small (Build –2): one penalty die.
G  Target is large (Build 4+): one bonus die.
G  Loading  1  bullet  and  shooting  in  same  round:  one 

penalty die.

G  Firing  2+  shots  from  a  handgun  in  one  round:  one 

penalty die on all shots.

G  Firing into melee: one penalty die.

Aiming: Must be declared on the character’s turn in the order 
of combat. The shot is taken on the same turn in the order of 
combat on the following round. If the aiming character takes 
damage or moves while aiming, the advantage of aiming is lost. 

Firing  into  melee  combat:  A  fumble  indicates  an  ally  has 
been hit. If multiple allies are in the line of fire, the one with 
the lowest Luck score is hit.

chapter 16: APPENDICES 
Reloading  Firearms:  One  combat  round 
to load two shells into any handgun, rifle 
or shotgun. Allow one round to exchange 
a clip. Allow two rounds to change a ma-
chine gun belt.

Full Auto/ 
Burst Fire

Player  declares  the  number  of  bullets  to 
be  fired  before  rolling  dice.  Full  auto  fire 
is  divided  into  a  number  of  volleys;  each 
volley requires a skill roll. Divide firer’s skill 
by  10  (round  down)  to  determine  how 
many bullets are in a volley (regardless of 
skill, a volley is never less than 3 bullets). 
The attacker must make a fresh attack roll 
for each volley of shots or whenever they 
select  a  new  target.  Burst  fire  is  a  single 
skill roll (a single volley).

Ammunition is expended when moving 
between targets (one bullet per meter/yard).

Rolling to Hit with Full Auto/Burst Fire:

First  attack  roll:  set  difficulty  by  range 
and then apply any modifiers.

Second  and  further  attack  rolls:  add 
one  penalty  die  (or  remove  a  bonus  die) 
for each additional attack roll. If this would 
incur  three  penalty  dice,  stick  with  two 
penalty  dice  and  raise  the  difficulty  level 
by one step.

Resolving each attack roll:
