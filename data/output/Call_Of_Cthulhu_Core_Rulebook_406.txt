Horse
Horses offer many advantages to those who know their ways. 
For  roleplaying,  divide  them  into  riding  horses,  draught 
horses, donkeys, and mules.

Use of the riding horse is covered by the Ride skill. Single 
riders and small groups can easily cover forty miles in a day, 
given  plenty  of  water  and  fodder,  such  as  oats  and  other 
grains. Riding horses may spar with other horses, but they 
do  not  fight  unless  cornered.  Even  cavalry-trained  horses 
are  trained  merely  to  stay  their  ground  and  control  their 
nervousness. Nearly all horses will panic at the presence of 
some supernatural thing.

Draught horses are the largest of horses, usually broken 
to  ride  but  not  much  ridden.  To  hitch  them  to  wagons,  a 
Drive  Horses  or  similar  roll  might  be  asked.  Saddles  and 
girths large enough for them may not exist; bareback riding 
could be done with one penalty die to the Ride skill.

Donkeys  and  mules  mostly  carry  burdens,  not  riders, 
or draw wagons or carts. Stereotypically, they ignore com-
mands when it pleases them, even brutal ones.

Among  all  horses,  the  tendency  concerning  bloody 
events, gunfire, monsters, angry crowds and so on, will be a 
sensible one, to flee.
