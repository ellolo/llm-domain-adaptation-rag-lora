1. The most a person 
of Build 0 might do to a person of Build 
2 is to unbalance them or disarm them.
Using  this  as  a  guide,  it  becomes 
simple  to  figure  the  relative  capability 
of a monster to lift and throw things—
for example, whether a monster is large 
enough to throw a car.

i  If a target is 2 builds smaller: it can be thrown.
i  If a target is 1 build smaller: it can be lifted with ease.
i  If a target is of equal build: it can be carried for a 

short time.

i  If a target is 1 build larger: it can barely be lifted.
i  If a target is 2 builds larger: it cannot be lifted, but 

might be unbalanced or disarmed.

parative beings as a guide.

Mythos  gods  and  some  Mythos  monsters  are  multidi-
mensional, existing in our plane of reality as well as others 
beyond our reasoning, and thus cannot be truly slain. While 
hit points are given, should such a creature as an Outer God 
or  Great  Old  One  be  somehow  reduced  to  0  or  negative 
hit points, the thing is not killed or rendered unconscious, 
but is dispelled or forced back from whence it came. Mere 
damage will not destroy or even harm these powers. If they 
are forced or persuaded to leave, they can return.

Playing Monsters  
Effectively
Monsters are, for the most part, not mindless animals. Many 
are of equal or greater intelligence than the investigators, with 
motivations  and  concerns  beyond  the  scope  of  the  average 
human’s understanding. Monsters will not automatically seek 
combat and, if they do, they will not necessarily seek to kill 
the investigators. The more intelligent monsters may take the 
investigators  captive,  either  to  use  as  slaves  or  sacrifices,  or 
perhaps for experimental purposes. Not every encounter has 
to be a fight; hiding or fleeing may be the wisest option.

When involved in combat, consider the monster’s objec-
tive. If its aim is to kill the investigator, it should fight back 
rather than dodge. If it wants to escape from the investigators, 
it may choose to dodge in order to gain an opportunity to flee. 
Many Mythos monsters can use spells, casting them as any 
other spell caster would. In some cases a monster’s spell may be 
portrayed as a manifestation of that monster’s innate power. 

Monsters  may  not  have  skills  listed,  though  most  or 
all  might  have  a  few  skills  such  as  Listen,  Stealth,  or  Spot 

Monsters and Investigators— 
a Comparison
It is quite possible for the investigators to beat some monsters 
in combat. Against others, their only chance of survival is gen-
erally to flee or hide. Deep ones, byakhees, dimensional sham-
blers, fire vampires, ghasts, ghouls, servants of Gla'aki, mi-go,
