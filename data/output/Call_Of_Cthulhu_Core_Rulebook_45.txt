  are  expert  with  weapons, 
though  often  they  have  passing 
acquaintance with them. Except 
for  a  few  occupations  like  Sol-
dier,  additional  skill  points  for 
Fighting and Firearms normally 
come  out  of  personal  interest 
skill points. 

Refer to the Equipment lists 
(pages 396-400) and Table XVII: 
Weapons (pages 401-405).

Other Ways 
of  Creating 
Investigators
The  bottom  line  in  creating  an 
investigator is that you generate 
a  set  of  characteristics  that  fit 
within the appropriate range of 
values.  The  method  you  use  is 
secondary  to  this,  and  different 
groups  will  agree  on  different 
methods. Some prefer a random 
approach;  others  prefer  varying 
degrees of freedom to exchange 
or  modify  the  values,  perhaps 
with  a  view  to  fitting  the  char-
acteristics  to  a  preconceived 
character template, or to fit their 
perception of game balance.

For  these  reasons,  a  selection 
of  alternative  methods  for  creat-
ing  investigators  are  listed  below. 
The  Keeper  should  discuss  and 
decide which method or combination of methods for creating 
investigators best suits his or her group.

Option 1: Start Over
Use the default method. If you donâ€™t like your dice rolls then 
scrap them and start again. The Keeper may allow the use of 
this option whenever a player rolls three or more character-
istics that begin below 50.

Option 2: Modifying Low Rolls
Use the default method. If you feel there are too many low 
rolls  (perhaps  three  or  more  under  10),  roll  an  additional 
1D6 and share out the extra points among the lowest dice 
rolls before multiplying by 5.
