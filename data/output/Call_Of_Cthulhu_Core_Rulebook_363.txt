Tcho-Tcho
Our attackers…were a horde of little men, the tallest of them 
no more than four feet, with singularly small eyes set deep 
in dome-like, hairless heads. These…attackers fell upon the 
party and had killed men and animals with their bright 
swords almost before our men could extract their weapons.
—August Derleth and Mark Schorer, The Lair of the Star-Spawn

The blasted Plateau of Tsang in Tibet is claimed to be one 
of the incursions of dread Leng into our space-time. On it 
and in a few other far-removed regions dwell the tribes of 
the tcho-tchos. In the beginnings of time, Chaugnar Faugn 
made a race of beings, the Miri Nigri, to serve him. The Miri 
were a race of dwarfs fashioned from the flesh of primitive 
amphibians. The tcho-tchos are said to come from humans 
who intermingled with the horrible Miri, forming a hybrid 
race of evil intent. Descendants are outwardly human-like, 
and of various sizes and costume, however the taint of the 
Miri curses all tcho-tchos with Half-normal sanity at birth. 
The  remaining  sanity  of  the  tcho-tchos  is  rapidly  eroded 
in a few years by participation in unspeakable ceremonies 
and horrific deeds, while a desire for inflicting cruelty and 
torture upon others becomes second nature.

Differing tcho-tcho tribes worship a variety of Great Old 

Ones, not just Chaugnar Faugn. 

SPECIAL POWERS
