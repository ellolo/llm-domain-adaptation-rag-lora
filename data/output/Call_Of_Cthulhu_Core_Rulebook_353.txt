 may combine their attacks to get hold of a strong 
victim (potentially granting the outnumbered bonus die).
Tickle:  Nightgaunts  may  only  tickle  foes  who  have  already  been 
seized. A successful tickling attack is extremely unnerving, for 
the barb of their tail is razor-sharp and perilous even while its 
light application does no damage—the target becomes bewil-
dered, humiliated, and disoriented, suffering a penalty die on 
all rolls for 1D4 rounds or until the tickling stops. Nightgaunt 
tails can snake through holes and openings, slice through thick 
clothes, and find even the interstices of metal armor.

Rat-Thing 

The bones of the tiny paws, it is 
rumoured, imply prehensile charac-
teristics more typical of a diminutive 
monkey than of a rat; while the small 
skull with its savage yellow fangs is 

of the utmost anomalousness, appearing from  
certain angles like a miniature, monstrously degraded  
parody of a human skull.

—H.P. Lovecraft, The Dreams in the Witch House

Resembling  ordinary  rats  and  easily  mistaken  for  them  at 
a distance. However close-up, the head of a rat-thing is an 
evil caricature of a human head, and their paws are like tiny 
human hands. All have extremely strong, sharp teeth. 

These unnatural creatures are possibly created by malign 
sorcery.  Sometimes  a  faithful  servant  may  be  transformed 
into a rat-thing, and thus continue to serve his or her mas-
ter. It is said such abominations are wise in the lore of the 
Mythos and may be gifted as familiars to witches and sor-
cerers beloved of the dark gods. Brown Jenkin, the familiar 
of Keziah Mason, the witch, was a rat-thing.

SPECIAL POWERS

Spells:  Rat-things  have  a  30%  chance  of  knowing  1D3 
spells; those who knew spells in life retain that knowledge 
as rat-things. If the rat-thing is a gift from an Outer God or 
some-such entity, it is likely to know many more spells.
