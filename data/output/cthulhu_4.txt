Introduction

The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of 
the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid 
island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was 
not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining 
in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the 
piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying 
vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall 
either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace 
and safety of a new dark age...

—H.P. Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu"

Welcome to 
Call of Cthulhu! 

all of Cthulhu is a game full of secrets, myster-
ies and horror. Playing the role of a steadfast 
investigator,  you  will  travel  to  strange  and 
dangerous  places,  uncover  foul  plots  and 
stand against the terrors of the night. You will 
encounter  sanity-blasting  entities,  monsters  and  insane 
cultists. Within strange and forgotten tomes of lore you will 
find secrets that man was not meant to know. 

You and your companions may very well decide the fate 

of the world.

Call  of  Cthulhu  is  a  horror-themed  roleplaying  game 
based on the writings of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft 
penned  a  tremendous  body  of  work  during  the  1920s  and 
1930s, concerning both horrors from beyond and from with-
in. Following his death in 1937, Lovecraft’s stories of cosmic 
horror  have  grown  in  reputation  and  stature,  and  today  he 
is recognized as a major American horror story writer of the 
twentieth  century,  influencing  numerous  authors  and  film 
directors,  and  amassing  a  huge  following  of  devoted  fans. 
Indeed,  Lovecraft  himself  could  now  be  considered  a  cult 
figure in his own right. Lovecraft’s fiction ranges from science 
fiction  to  gothic  horror  and  into  nihilistic  cosmic  terror—
perfect material on which to base a roleplaying game.

Lovecraft’s  most  famous  invention  has  become  known 
as the Cthulhu Mythos, a series of stories sharing common 
plot elements, such as certain mythical books of arcane lore 
and  alien  godlike  entities.  The  Cthulhu  Mythos  fired  the 
imagination of other authors, mostly protégés and friends 
of  Lovecraft,  and  soon  they  were  adding  to  this  complex 
mythology, further advancing its concepts and constituent 
parts.  Today, “Cthulhu”  stories  are  still  being  written  (and 
filmed) by the heirs to Lovecraft’s literary legacy.

An Overview of the Game
The aim of playing Call of Cthulhu is to have fun with your 
friends as you explore and create a Lovecraftian story. One
