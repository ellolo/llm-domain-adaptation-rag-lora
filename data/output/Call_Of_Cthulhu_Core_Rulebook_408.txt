individual using the maneuver rules, because of their numbers 
they gain one bonus die on the attack. Such an attack would 
involve swarming over the target, biting and scratching as they 
do so.

Shark

Snake
Broadly falling into two categories: constrictors and venom-
ous.  The  former  use  their  attack  to  grapple  and  constrict 
their  prey  (use  the  maneuver  rules),  the  latter  using  their 
attack to bite. 

ATTACKS 
Attacks per round: 1 (can use Bite to fight-back numerous times 

per round)

Fighting  attacks:  Bite.  The  toxicity  of  snake  venom  can  vary. 
Victims  must  make  an  Extreme  CON  roll  to  resist  full  effect 
of the poison. A successful roll indicates a lesser effect. Unless 
antivenin or suitable medical treatment can be found within a 
few hours, the victim of a bite may die (see Poisons, page 128).
