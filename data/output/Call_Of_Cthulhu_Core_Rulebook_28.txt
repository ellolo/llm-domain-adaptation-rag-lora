 Bonus" (DB) and Build. 
Larger and stronger creatures and humans do more physical 
damage than their weaker brethren. 

To determine damage bonus, add STR to SIZ and look 
up  the  total  on  Table  1:  Damage  Bonus  and  Build.  Each 
range of results correlates with a die modifier or dice roll. 
Build is determined using the same figures.

In  hand-to-hand  combat,  add  the  indicated  damage 
bonus modifier or roll to all the character’s blows, whether 
using a natural weapon, such as a fist, or a melee weapon.  

Build is used in fighting maneuvers and chases, and also 
to give a sense of scale (see Fighting Maneuvers, page 105).
Note: Damage bonus is not applied to firearms attacks.

Someone with a combined STR and SIZ of 134 would 
add  1D4  to  hand-to-hand  damage  rolls,  while  a 
weakling investigator whose combined value is only 
70 would deduct 1 point from melee damage.

Hit Points [CON & SIZ] 
Hit points are used to track the cumulative damage inflicted 
upon  an  investigator,  non-player  character,  or  monster 
during the game, and indicate how long he or she can stay in 
the action before collapsing from pain, exhaustion, or death.
Figure out the character’s hit point total by adding CON and 
SIZ, then dividing the total by ten (rounding down any fractions).
The investigator sheet is designed to help the player keep 
track  of  hit  points  and  wounds.  Enter  the  investigator’s  Hit 
Point Total in the box marked "Hit Points". For more details on 
hit points and wounds, see Wounds and Healing (page 119).

Movement Rate (MOV) 
An investigator can move a number of yards (or meters) up 
to five times their MOV value in one round.

If both DEX and STR are each less than SIZ:  MOV 7
If either STR or DEX is equal to or greater  
MOV 8
than SIZ, or if all three are equal:  
If both STR and DEX are each greater than SIZ: MOV 9

If age is in the 40s:              deduct 1 from MOV
If age is in the 50s:              deduct 2 from MOV
If age is in the 60s:              deduct 3 from MOV
If age is in the 70s:              deduct 4 from MOV
If age is in the 80s:              deduct 5 from MOV

Note: Do not apply these MOV rules to non-humans.

Step 2: Determine  
Occupation
An occupation shows how an investigator makes a living, be 
it as a doctor, a student, or lowlife fraudster. An occupation 
also reflects a particular investigator’s field of expertise, and 
so dictates which of their skills should be higher.

The  actual  occupation  of  your  investigator  will  have 
limited effect during the game; it is simply a basis for your 
investigator’s starting skills and helping to define his or her 
backstory.  Some  occupations  are  typically  Lovecraftian: 
Antiquarian, Author, Dilettante, Doctor of Medicine, Jour-
nalist,  Police  Detective,  and  Professor.  Other  occupations 
are not those you would normally find in a Lovecraft story, 
however they may interest particular players
