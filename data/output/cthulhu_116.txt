chapter 6: combatHarvey and his friend Rodger spot the cultist they suspect to be carrying the Book of Eibon in a briefcase. The cultist 
is standing on the station platform, awaiting a train. Harvey takes advantage of the fact that they have not met and 
approaches the cultist to enquire when the next train is due.

Harvey attempts to snatch the briefcase from the cultist. The Keeper rules that this constitutes a fighting maneuver 
(see Fighting Maneuvers, page 105) since it will clearly initiate a combat and it is similar in intent to disarming an op-
ponent. The cultist’s DEX is higher than Harvey’s, but he is not aware of being in combat until Harvey acts, although he 
may anticipate Harvey’s action—see Striking the First Blow (Surprise Attacks), page 106. Using the rules for surprise 
attacks, the Keeper asks for a Stealth roll from Harvey, setting the difficulty level as Regular (the cultist’s Spot Hidden skill 
is below 50). Harvey is successful and the cultist doesn’t see the attack coming.
Harvey’s surprise attack:

Harvey attempts to snatch the cultist’s case using a fighting maneuver. The cultist does not get a chance to dodge or 
fight back as he is unaware of the attack. Harvey gained a surprise attack and so has one bonus die for his maneuver. 
When figuring the outcome of a Fighting maneuver, the opponent’s Build must always be factored in. The cultist’s Build 
is one step above Harvey’s, so Harvey gains a penalty die. The bonus die and penalty die cancel each other out.

An 11 is rolled for Harvey’s Fighting (Brawl) skill—a Hard success.
No opposing roll is made for the cultist on account of Harvey having the advantage of surprise.
Harvey snatches the bag from the cultist.
Now that Harvey’s surprise attack is concluded, the Keeper switches to using combat rounds (see
