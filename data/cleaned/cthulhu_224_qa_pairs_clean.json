  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a role-playing game, perception rolls can be used to uncover hidden clues or notice suspicious events. However, the Keeper can use discretion to determine the difficulty of the roll, taking into account factors such as the investigators' skills, equipment, and the situation. The Keeper can also allow players to combine different skills, such as Spot Hidden and Psychology, to achieve a higher roll. Additionally, the Keeper can set specific goals for perception rolls, such as finding a specific item or searching a room, to guide the player's actions. If no clues are present, the Keeper can use the \"nothing there\" technique to resolve the situation.",
