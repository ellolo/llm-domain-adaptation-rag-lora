  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe \"Graveyard Kiss\" spell, also known as \"Create Zombie Variant,\" is a ritual that transforms a human corpse into a mindless zombie under the caster's control. The spell requires a human corpse, the caster's own blood, and a significant loss of Sanity points (5 points). The zombie is linked to the caster and will follow simple commands, but its life is tied to the caster's, and it will rot away if the caster dies. A more sinister version of the spell, \"Create Zombie,\" involves capturing and murdering a living person, burying them alive, and then converting them into a zombie.",
