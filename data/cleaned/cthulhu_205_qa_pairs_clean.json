  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, non-player characters (NPCs) can be a crucial element in creating a believable and engaging story. To present NPCs in a believable way, use roleplaying hooks that provide motivation and direction for the players, such as requests, demands, and problems. These hooks can be tied to the core plot and create a sense of layering and engagement. The Keeper can also define the function and purpose of authorities, such as law enforcement, to either aid or hinder the investigation. By presenting NPCs and authorities in a nuanced and realistic way, the game can become more immersive and challenging for the players.",
