Animated skeletons are weak and fragile, but can be equipped with weapons to deal damage. Vampires, on the other hand, are powerful and have special abilities such as the ability to drain blood from victims, hypnotize them with a gaze, and transform into smoke or mist when their hit points reach zero. Vampires also have unique abilities and powers, such as the third bite causing a character to die and become a vampire, and the ability to regenerate hit points.",
