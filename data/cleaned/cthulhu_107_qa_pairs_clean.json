  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a combat scenario, the Keeper should guide the players through the action and outcome of the fight, rather than simply rolling dice. The Keeper should ask the player to describe their character's actions and then determine the required skill roll. The outcome of the roll is then incorporated back into the story, and the Keeper should use descriptive language to convey the success or failure of the action. The combat is structured into rounds, with each player taking one turn in each round, to maintain order and clarity.",
