  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the context of the Mythos, a person's \"Build\" refers to their physical strength and capabilities, which can be compared to that of other creatures. The table \"Comparative Builds\" provides a guide to estimate the relative capability of a monster to lift and throw objects, with a target being 2 builds smaller being easily thrown, 1 build smaller being easily lifted, and 1 build larger being barely lifted. This guide can help investigators and game masters determine the feasibility of combat and other interactions with monsters. Additionally, the document highlights the intelligence and motivations of monsters, which can range from simple animals to highly intelligent and malevolent beings.",
