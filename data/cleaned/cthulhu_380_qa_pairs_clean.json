  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nGla'aki, a powerful and malevolent deity, is described as a servant of the alien god Hastur. Gla'aki's powers involve injecting a fluid into a victim's spine, which can either kill them, turn them into an undead slave, or leave them unharmed. The victim's fate depends on the damage caused by the spine and whether the fluid is injected before the spine is broken off. Gla'aki is also connected to Hastur and is said to be served by the byakhee, an interstellar flying race.",
