  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the context of the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, the \"Rich\" category is defined by an investigator's credit rating of 99, indicating that they are among the richest in the world. This category allows for unlimited spending on accommodations, food, and incidental travel expenses, as long as the investigator's spending falls within their living standard. The investigator's assets, such as property, investments, and shares, also play a role in determining their spending level and available cash. The \"Rich\" category is designed to provide a high level of financial flexibility for investigators, allowing them to pursue their investigations without worrying about the cost.",
