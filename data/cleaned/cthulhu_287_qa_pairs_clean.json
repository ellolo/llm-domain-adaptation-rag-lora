  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nContact Deity spells are a rare and powerful form of magic that allows a caster to establish a connection with a deity or Great Old One. These spells require a significant sacrifice of POW and Sanity points, and the success rate is determined by the caster's reduced POW. Each deity has its own unique characteristics and responses to the caster, ranging from informative visions to attempts to convert or possess them. The use of Contact Deity spells is typically reserved for insane priests or independent sorcerers, and the risks of failure are high.",
