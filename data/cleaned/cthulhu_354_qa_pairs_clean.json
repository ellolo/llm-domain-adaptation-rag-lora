  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes the Serpent People, a humanoid species resembling upright serpents with ophidian heads and scales. They are a refined and cultured race, often revered as the followers of the god Yig, who is considered the father of all snakes. The Serpent People have a complex history, with multiple kingdoms rising and falling over millions of years, and have been known to possess great sorcery and scientific abilities. They are now largely extinct, with only a few remnants surviving, including degenerate and hibernating individuals who retain some of their former powers.",
