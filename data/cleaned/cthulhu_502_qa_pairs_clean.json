  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the rules for a \"Cut to the Chase\" chase scene are outlined, where characters or vehicles are pursued by others. The chase is resolved through a series of skill rolls, movement actions, and combat encounters. The pursuers are placed in order of speed, and the fleeing characters/vehicles are positioned accordingly. Hazards, barriers, and combat are also resolved through skill rolls and combat encounters, with specific rules for vehicles and combat. The environment can also affect the chase, with random locations and penalties added to the roll.",
