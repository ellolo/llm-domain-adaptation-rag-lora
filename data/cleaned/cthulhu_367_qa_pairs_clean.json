  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes two mythological entities: Abhoth and Azathoth. Abhoth is a creature that withdraws to the earth when reduced to 0 hit points, while Azathoth is a powerful, nuclear chaos deity that can destroy entire areas with its pseudopods. Azathoth is said to rule all spiders and has the power to command other gods, but its true nature and secrets are shrouded in madness-inducing forbidden knowledge. Seeing either entity can cause significant sanity loss, with Azathoth being particularly terrifying.",
