  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, pushing skills refers to situations where a character's skills are significantly more difficult than the regular difficulty level. Pushed rolls require a roll of equal to or below half of the skill value, and the consequences of failure can be extreme and bizarre, especially when the character is insane. Combined skill rolls involve making a single dice roll against multiple skills, which can be more efficient but also increases the risk of failure. The Keeper's discretion is key in determining the difficulty level and consequences of pushed rolls.",
