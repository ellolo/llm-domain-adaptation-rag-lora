  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, Great Old Ones are powerful, supernatural beings that are worshipped by humans, but are often isolated from human affairs. Each Great Old One is independent and has its own unique abilities, with some being temporarily imprisoned or sleeping in vast tombs. The worship of Great Old Ones is often secretive and concentrated in remote areas, with some, like Cthulhu, being more prominent than others. Servitor species, such as byakhee and nightgaunts, are often associated with specific Great Old Ones and can serve as assassins, messengers, or spies. The worship of Outer Gods is less common, but still present, with some, like Hastur, being more prominent than others.",
