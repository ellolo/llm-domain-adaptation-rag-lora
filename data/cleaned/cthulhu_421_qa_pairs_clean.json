  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe investigators are tasked with tracking down a pair of hunters, Alistair Lawson and his son George, who are unaware of a manhunt and have been spotted carrying rifles and packs. If the investigators spot them, they can attempt to contact them by waving or crying out, or make a group Luck roll to avoid being mistaken for a wild animal. However, if the hunters are spotted before the investigators, they may fire at them, causing minor damage. The hunters are also aware of the disappearance of Brian Hall and his son Arthur, and are seeking information about them.",
