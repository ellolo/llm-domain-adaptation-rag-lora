  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Gate Creation and Travel Costs Table provides a reference for calculating the costs associated with creating and traveling through magical gates. The table lists the distance in miles or light years and the required magic points (POW) needed to create or travel through a gate. The cost of viewing a gate, which allows the caster and companions to see what's on the other side without passing through, is variable and depends on the number of magic points and Sanity points required. The cost of viewing is typically one-tenth of the gate's cost, and additional Sanity charges may be required if the view is horrific.",
