  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Mythos of H.P. Lovecraft, the Outer Gods are a group of powerful, cosmic deities that are worshipped by various races and lesser deities. They are led by Nyarlathotep, their messenger and soul, and are associated with chaos and destruction. The Outer Gods are distinct from the Elder Gods, who are often seen as opposing forces, and are not typically worshipped by humans. The Great Old Ones, on the other hand, are god-like beings that are more likely to be worshipped by humans due to their proximity and occasional involvement in human affairs.",
