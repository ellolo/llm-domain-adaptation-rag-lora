  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document discusses the \"Psychology\" skill in the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, which allows investigators to study individuals and form an idea of their motives and character. This skill can be used to oppose various social interaction rolls, such as Intimidate, Fast Talk, Persuade, and Charm, and can also be used to see through disguises. Failing a Pushed roll, which involves immersing oneself in data about a target, can have significant consequences, including revealing one's own motivations or launching a physical attack. The skill can also be used to read lips, allowing investigators to listen in on conversations without being heard.",
