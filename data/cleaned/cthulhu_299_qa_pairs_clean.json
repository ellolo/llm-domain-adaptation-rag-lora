  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes three magical spells: Mind Transfer, which allows a caster to permanently take control of a target's body; Prinn's Crux Ansata, a harassment spell that projects the caster's image onto a mirror, allowing them to see and communicate with the target; and Powder of Ibn-Ghazi, a spell that creates a temporary, silvery cloud that can be used to observe or communicate with a target. These spells have varying costs, casting times, and effects, and are used for different purposes, such as ensuring longevity, sending warnings, or gathering information. The Mind Transfer spell is particularly powerful, but also carries significant risks, including the caster's soul dissipating into eternity if the spell fails.",
