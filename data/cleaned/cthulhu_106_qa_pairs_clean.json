  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document discusses the \"Spending Luck\" optional rule in the Call of Cthulhu game system, which allows players to use Luck points to alter the outcome of skill rolls. Luck points can be spent on a 1-for-1 basis, but cannot be used to alter the result of a pushed roll or to buy off critical failures. The Luck score can be recovered through improvement checks, which can increase or decrease the score. This rule adds a layer of strategy to the game, as players must carefully manage their Luck points to achieve their goals.",
