  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe \"Jump\" skill in the Call of Cthulhu game allows investigators to leap, jump, or fall with varying degrees of success, depending on the difficulty level. A successful Jump can reduce fall damage, allow for longer jumps, and even enable investigators to push themselves to extreme heights. The skill also has a \"Pushed\" variant, which requires more success and can result in more severe consequences if failed. Additionally, the \"Other Language\" skill allows investigators to understand and communicate in languages other than their own, with varying levels of proficiency.",
