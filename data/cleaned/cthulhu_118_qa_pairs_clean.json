Meanwhile, Harvey flees the scene, but the cultist gives chase. In the third combat round, Harvey seizes an opportunity to use the briefcase by pushing the cultist in front of an incoming train, using his cunning and a successful fighting maneuver. The cultist's Dominate spell fails, and Harvey's Luck roll allows him to take advantage of the situation.",
