These spells allow for the summoning of various supernatural entities, including Dimensional Shambler, Fire Vampire, Hunting Horror, Nightgaunt, Servitor of the Outer Gods, and Star Vampire. Each spell has its own unique requirements, such as specific materials, rituals, and timing, and some may require a loss of Sanity or POW to succeed. The spells can be cast at different times of day, with some requiring specific celestial alignments or lunar phases. The document also notes that some entities are more easily confused or affected by certain conditions, such as bright sunlight or the presence of certain celestial bodies.",
