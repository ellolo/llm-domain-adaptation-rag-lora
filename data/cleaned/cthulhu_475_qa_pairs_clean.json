  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the 7th edition of Call of Cthulhu, the game's mechanics have been updated to unify characteristics and skills, making it easier to compare and calculate rolls. The decision was made to separate Luck from POW, as POW is significant elsewhere in the game, and to roll Luck randomly (3D6 x 5). Additionally, the game's characteristic system has been revised, with the STR, DEX, CON, SIZ, APP, INT, POW, and EDU characteristics now providing one-fifth values, which can be multiplied by five and divided by two to calculate full values.",
