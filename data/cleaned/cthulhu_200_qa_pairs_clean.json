  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a horror film or tabletop role-playing game, creating a collaborative story involves incorporating the players' ideas and backstories into the plot. The game master should listen to the players' descriptions of their investigators and incorporate them into the story, rather than imposing pre-determined details. This two-way process allows the game to feel more collaborative and immersive, and can be achieved by adapting the scenario to the players' contributions. By doing so, the game master can create a more engaging and dynamic story that resonates with each player.",
