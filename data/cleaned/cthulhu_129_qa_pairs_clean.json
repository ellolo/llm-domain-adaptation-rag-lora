  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the rules for recovering from damage and injuries are outlined for a character in a game. Regular damage can be recovered at a rate of 1 hit point per day, while major wounds require a CON roll to recover, with success adding bonus dice for rest and medical care. If a character's hit points fall to zero, they are considered dying and must make a CON roll to recover. The document also outlines the process for administering first aid and medicine to stabilize a character's hit points.",
