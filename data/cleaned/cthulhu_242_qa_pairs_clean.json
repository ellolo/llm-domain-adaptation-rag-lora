  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document explores the theme of Cosmic Horror, a subgenre of horror fiction that delves into the existential terror of humanity's insignificance in the face of an uncaring, eldritch universe. This theme is exemplified in the works of H.P. Lovecraft, who portrays the scientific advancements of the 20th century as a terrifying void in human understanding. The document also provides guidance on creating a horror scenario, emphasizing the importance of a compelling opening scene that sets the stage for the investigation and raises the stakes for the players. Key concepts include the corrupting influence of exposure to the Mythos, the dangers of delving into the unknown, and the blurring of lines between sanity and humanity.",
