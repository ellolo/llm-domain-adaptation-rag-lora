The document also outlines the \"Climb\" skill, which allows characters to ascend vertical surfaces, and provides guidelines for determining difficulty levels and consequences of failure. Additionally, it explains the Interpersonal Skills, including Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate, and Persuade, and how they are used in the game.",
