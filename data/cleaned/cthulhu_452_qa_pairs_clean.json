  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nLucy Stone, the last living witness to Charles Leiter's activities, is in a precarious position as she holds crucial information about Leiter's death. Several parties, including Anthony Flinders, Abner Wick, and the Atlantic City mob, are willing to kill her to obtain this information. Abner Wick, an antiques dealer with a questionable reputation, had a bidding war with Leiter over the Witch Trial Papers and may have had a motive to silence him. Wick's true intentions and identities of his \"foreign\" clients remain unclear, adding to the mystery.",
