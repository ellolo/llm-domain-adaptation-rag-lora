  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a role-playing game, particularly one involving a mystery or horror theme, the Keeper should not be afraid to adapt the narrative to the players' choices, allowing them to explore different paths and leads. This can lead to a more immersive and engaging experience for the players. The Keeper should also be prepared to introduce complications and dangers to slow down the investigation, and to use the game's mechanics, such as the Idea roll, to resolve conflicts. By doing so, the Keeper can create a more dynamic and thrilling game world.",
