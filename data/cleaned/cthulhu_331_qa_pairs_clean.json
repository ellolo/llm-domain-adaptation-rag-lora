Lovecraft's works, primarily serving Cthulhu and other beings. They are immortal unless slain and have the ability to breathe underwater and on land. Deep Ones are capable of draining the life force of humans, dealing significant damage, and have a 40% chance of knowing spells. They are also known for their cold, beautiful, and cruel lives, and are often worshiped by humans who interbreed with them. The Deep Ones are connected to ancient, dark fertility cults and have a strong connection to the natural world.",
