  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nA chthonian is a type of supernatural entity that can exert mental influence over humans, binding them to a site or location. Chthonians can communicate with humans telepathically, but this process costs them magic points, which can be shared among multiple chthonians. They can also create earthquakes, which require a collective effort and magic points from participating chthonians. Chthonians are formidable opponents, with abilities that include crushing attacks, hold and drain abilities, and the potential to drain human magic points. They are also capable of knowing various spells, often tied to Great Old Ones like Cthulhu.",
