  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, the desert environment will lead to severe conditions, where investigators can suffer from damage and potentially die if they fail to make a CON roll each day. To maintain control and consistency, the Keeper should establish a list of investigators and non-player characters in DEX order, and resolve actions in that order. Additionally, the Keeper should use their judgment to balance realism with dramatic situations, and apply the standard damage rules for non-player characters.",
