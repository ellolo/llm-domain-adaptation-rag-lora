  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIthaqua, a powerful being from the King in Yellow mythos, is a formidable foe in a fantasy setting. He can attack with physical strength, use wind gusts to lift and drop victims, and possess them with his claws. Ithaqua's abilities are fueled by his connection to the Earth and the imprisoned god he represents, and his servants, the burning-ice wind and other minions, can also act independently. His stats and abilities are outlined in the document, making him a powerful and intimidating opponent.",
