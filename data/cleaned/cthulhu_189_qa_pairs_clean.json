  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, learning and casting spells is a crucial aspect of gameplay. To learn a spell, a character must attempt a Hard INT roll, which can be pushed by justifying the character's actions, such as isolating themselves in isolation. Once learned, a character can teach the spell to others, but learning from a Mythos entity, such as a cultist or a supernatural being, can be a more unpredictable and potentially sanity-destroying experience. Casting spells requires a combination of knowledge, magical points, and physical components, and can have varying levels of difficulty and consequences.",
