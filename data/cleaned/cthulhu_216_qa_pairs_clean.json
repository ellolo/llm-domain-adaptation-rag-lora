  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nAs a Keeper in a Call of Cthulhu game, your primary goal is to create a tense and thrilling experience for your players. To achieve this, you should pace the game carefully, building tension and escalating the stakes throughout the story. This may involve starting with a low-key opening and gradually increasing the tension, or starting with a dramatic event and alternating between intense scenes. You should also be mindful of the horror genre's effects on characters, as they are more susceptible to injury and decline in effectiveness over time. By doing so, you can create a thrilling and immersive experience for your players.",
