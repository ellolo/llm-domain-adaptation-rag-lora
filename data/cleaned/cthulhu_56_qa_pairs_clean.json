  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, investigators can use various skills to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. The \"Pushed\" skill, which involves forcing oneself to perform a task, can be used to overcome physical obstacles such as climbing or navigating complex systems. Failing a Pushed roll can result in severe consequences, such as damage, loss of possessions, or even becoming stranded. Investigators can also use the Computer Use and Internet skills to access and analyze information, but these skills require careful rolls to avoid penalties or consequences.",
