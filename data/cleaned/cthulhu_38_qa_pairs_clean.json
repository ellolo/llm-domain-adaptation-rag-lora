The document also emphasizes the importance of crafting background entries that are specific, emotional, and emphatic, and that reflect the investigator's growing knowledge of the Mythos and their loss of sanity. Additionally, it highlights the role of the Keeper in adding or amending background entries during episodes of insanity or major wounds.",
