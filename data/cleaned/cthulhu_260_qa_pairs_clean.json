  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Necronomicon, a work attributed to the fictional astronomer, poet, philosopher, and scientist Al-Azrad, has a complex and shrouded history. The text was first translated into Greek by Theodorus Philetas in 950, and later into Latin by Olaus Wormius in 1228. The work was repeatedly translated, printed, and banned throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, with various versions emerging, including the Sussex Manuscript and the Voynich Manuscript. Today, only five copies of the Necronomicon are known to exist, although an unknown number may still be held. The text's history is marked by its condemnation by the Church and its association with occult and philosophical circles.",
