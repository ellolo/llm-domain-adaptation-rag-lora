  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, Chthonians are powerful, near-invulnerable creatures that can attack and drain the life force of their victims. They have two primary methods of attack: \"Hold and Drain\" (seizing tentacles) and \"Crush\" (using their immense bulk to crush a group). Chthonians are vulnerable to certain magical effects, such as the Vach-Viraj Chant and the Elder Sign, and can be repelled by total immersion in water. They also have a unique, sentient color that can feed on victims and leave a trail of radiation.",
