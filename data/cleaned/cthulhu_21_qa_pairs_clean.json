  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Outer Gods are a pantheon of deities in the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe created by H.P. Lovecraft. They are considered to be the rulers of the universe, with little to do with humanity except for the messenger god Nyarlathotep. The Outer Gods are often depicted as being almost true gods, with the ability to personify cosmic principles, and are rarely acknowledged or interacted with by humans. They are typically associated with madness, death, and destruction, and are often worshiped by secret cults or lone individuals. In contrast, the Great Old Ones, a separate pantheon of deities, are more supernatural and often interact with humans, leading to worship and cults.",
