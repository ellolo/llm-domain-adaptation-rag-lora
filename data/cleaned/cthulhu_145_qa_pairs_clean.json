  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the context of a Call of Cthulhu game, a chase can be a challenging and exciting scenario for characters and vehicles. The document outlines various barriers that can hinder progress, such as traffic jams, police roadblocks, and physical obstacles like fences and trees. To overcome these barriers, characters can use skills like Jumping, STR, and Locksmithing, or employ brute force by smashing through or breaking down the barrier. The consequences of breaking through a barrier can be severe, including damage to the vehicle and potential hazards for those following.",
