  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, a \"pushed roll\" refers to a skill or characteristic roll that is attempted multiple times, with the goal of achieving a specific outcome. When attempting a pushed roll, the Keeper can foreshadow the consequences of failure to create a more immersive and dramatic experience for the players. This can include describing the outcome of failure in detail, highlighting potential dangers, or hinting at unseen consequences. The Keeper's goal is to create an interesting and engaging consequence, rather than simply stating a flat failure.",
