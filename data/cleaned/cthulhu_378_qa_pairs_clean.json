  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nGhatanothoa, a monstrous deity from H.P. Lovecraft's works, is known for its horrific appearance and malevolent powers. It dwells in a burrow beneath a volcanic cone, which can be uncovered by tectonic upheavals, and is often associated with the cult of lloigor. Ghatanothoa's powers include the ability to curse its victims, causing them to lose DEX and eventually petrify, and it can regenerate from its injuries. The deity is said to be tied to the island of R'lyeh, which is also home to other Great Old Ones.",
