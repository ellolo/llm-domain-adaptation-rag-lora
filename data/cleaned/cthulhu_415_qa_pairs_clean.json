  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the 1920s, a group of servants of the Great Old One Gla'aki, led by Turner, have been searching for a shard of the crystal prison that was lost in the woods of Vermont. Recently, a team of surveyors and geologists, led by Lucas Strong, has been sent to the area to track down other deposits of the meteor's remains, which are believed to be toxic. However, a small-time crook named Sidney Harris has discovered the true purpose of the surveying team and has kidnapped Strong's daughter, Jane, in an attempt to extort money from Strong. As Harris and his men experience strange and terrifying dreams, they begin to succumb to the influence of Gla'aki, setting the stage for a violent confrontation with the authorities.",
