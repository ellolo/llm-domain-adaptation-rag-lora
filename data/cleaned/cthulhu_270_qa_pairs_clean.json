  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document, likely from the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, outlines the \"Tomes of Eldritch Lore\" and provides a list of spells with their standard purposes and results. The Keeper of the game is advised to modify these spells according to the needs of the scenario or campaign, as well as to consider the risks of using such powerful and otherworldly forces. The document also emphasizes the importance of maintaining sanity, as the casting of spells will inevitably lead to a gradual disintegration of the caster's link to reality. The goal of a cultist is to relinquish all sanity and replace it with an understanding of the true nature of the universe.",
