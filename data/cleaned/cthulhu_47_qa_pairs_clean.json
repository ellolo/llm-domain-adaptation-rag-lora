  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis reference chart provides half and fifth values for various skills in a game setting, allowing players and Keepers to determine the characteristic or skill value under the Base Number column. The chart also explains the concept of skill percentiles, which represent a character's knowledge or proficiency in a particular area, and how they can be affected by location and setting. Additionally, the document discusses the definitions and scope of skills within the game, including the use of generic names and the impact of skill levels on character performance.",
