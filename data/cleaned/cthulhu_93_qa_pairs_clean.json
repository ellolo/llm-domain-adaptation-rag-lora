  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game system, investigators can encounter various challenges and obstacles, including physical challenges, skill checks, and external events. When a character attempts to overcome an obstacle, they may roll a skill check, which can result in a success, failure, or fumble. A fumble is an unusual and unfortunate event that can have significant consequences, while a critical success is a rare and beneficial outcome that can provide additional benefits. The game system also includes a luck mechanic, which can be used to determine the outcome of events outside of the investigators' control.",
