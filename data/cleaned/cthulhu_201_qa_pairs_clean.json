  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document discusses approaches to creating investigator groups in a tabletop role-playing game, specifically in the context of the \"Call of Cthulhu\" game. One approach is to allow players to create their own investigators, which can lead to a more dynamic and personalized experience. Another approach is to pre-generate investigators and distribute them among the players, which can be useful for games with limited time slots. The key to successful investigator groups is to create balanced and well-rounded characters with unique skills and backstories, and to provide players with clear information about their investigators and the scenario.",
