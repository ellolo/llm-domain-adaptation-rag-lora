  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, the Keeper decides what to translate from a mysterious book, determining the language, translation speed, and accuracy. The investigator must make a Language skill roll to read the book, with the Keeper setting a difficulty level based on the book's age, form, and condition. If the investigator fails, they may gain some insight but also risk losing Sanity points, potentially triggering temporary insanity. The Keeper can also withhold information, as seen in Harvey's case, where he loses his mind and awakens in a cornfield.",
