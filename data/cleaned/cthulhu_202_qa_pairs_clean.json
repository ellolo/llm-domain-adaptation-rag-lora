  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nWhen creating investigators for a Call of Cthulhu game, it's essential to consider their individual perspectives and backstories, which may conflict with others. Instead of dictating how an investigator feels, provide the \"facts\" as they understand them, allowing the player to decide how they feel and what effect it has on their relationships. Reciprocal backstory information should be shared between investigators to ensure consistency and depth in the game world. Additionally, a motivation for the investigators to connect with the plot is necessary, such as employment or social connections.",
