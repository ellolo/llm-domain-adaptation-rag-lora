  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Formless Spawn are amorphous, shape-shifting horrors associated with the alien god Tsathoggua. They have a speed of half a mile per hour per point of POW and can generate hurricane-force winds within a few square miles. These creatures can take various forms, including toad-like lumps or elongated beings with hundreds of legs, and can attack in a variety of ways, including biting and forming whips or tentacles. They have a relatively low HP of 17 and can deal significant damage, especially when using enchanted weapons or forces like heat or electricity.",
