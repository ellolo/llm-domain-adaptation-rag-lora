  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the rules for assigning skill points to investigators are outlined. Investigators start with a base chance of success in each skill, which can be modified by allocating points to that skill. Personal interests and occupation skills can also be used to boost skills, with the option to add additional points to occupation skills. When choosing an occupation, players should consider the skills associated with it and how they will balance with other players' skills in the game. The goal is to create a well-rounded and enjoyable character that fits the scenario and style of play.",
