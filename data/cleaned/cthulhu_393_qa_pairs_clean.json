  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nUbbo-Sathla and Y'golonac are two minor gods in the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe of horror fiction. Ubbo-Sathla is a cold, malevolent deity that dwells in a dark cavern, where it spawns pseudopod-like creatures that attack and devour those who disturb it. Y'golonac, on the other hand, is a bloated, glowing figure that dwells in a vast underground ruin, and is known to emerge when evil is present, often in response to the reading of its name. Both gods have little cult following, but are feared and worshiped by various alien and human cults.",
