  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, Sanity is a crucial aspect of the investigator's mental state, and losing Sanity points can have severe consequences. If an investigator fails a reality check roll, they may enter a bout of madness, losing one Sanity point and becoming immune to further loss. Temporary insanity can last for 1D10 hours or a good night's sleep, while indefinite insanity requires ongoing treatment and recovery, with the player making a dice roll every month to progress. Effective treatment can be achieved through private care or institutionalization, with varying degrees of success determined by a dice roll.",
