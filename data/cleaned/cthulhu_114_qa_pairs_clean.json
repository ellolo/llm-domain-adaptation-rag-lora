  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this combat scenario, Harvey is ambushed by a thug while chasing a cultist in Boston. The Keeper allows Harvey to make a Spot Hidden roll to track the cultist, but Harvey fails, and the Keeper pushes the roll, allowing the thug to attack. Harvey attempts to push the thug aside and run past, but is stabbed for 6 points of damage. The Keeper then allows the thug to threaten Harvey with a knife and demand money, and Harvey surrenders his wallet. The document outlines the rules for resolving combat in this game system, including the use of skills, dice rolls, and penalties.",
