  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Hounds of Tindalos are a type of monstrous creature in the Call of Cthulhu universe, characterized by their bluish pus-like ichor that deals ongoing damage to victims. They can also inflict permanent damage through a tongue attack, which creates a deep, bloodless wound. The creatures are highly adaptable and can change their form, making them difficult to track or defeat. They are vulnerable to daylight and can be dispelled by intense light, but can be resistant to mundane attacks.",
