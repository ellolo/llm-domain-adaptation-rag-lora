  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the context of the game, researching a specific piece of information can be done by spending game hours studying a book, with the outcome determined by a roll of 1D100. The book's Cthulhu Mythos Rating determines the success of the investigation, and a full study of a tome can grant increases in other skills, including language skills and skills such as History, Archaeology, and Occult. Additionally, reading occult books can grant points to the Occult skill, while learning Mythos spells requires Magic points and can bring the character closer to insanity.",
