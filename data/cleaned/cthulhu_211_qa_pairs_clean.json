  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper's role is to create an interesting outcome for the player's actions, often in a horror-themed story. To achieve this, the Keeper can veto the player's comments, veto subsequent dice rolls, or create consequences for failure. The Keeper should also follow specific rules, such as not allowing consecutive rolls against the same skill and rolling dice in full view. Additionally, the Keeper should set difficulty levels that are consistent for all players, regardless of their skill level, and reserve dice rolls for important and dramatic moments.",
