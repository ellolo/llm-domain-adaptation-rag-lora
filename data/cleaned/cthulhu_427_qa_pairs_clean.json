  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe investigators enter a clearing and find a large communal tent, a painting studio, and sleeping tents. In the sleeping tents, they discover a notebook belonging to the artists, who are from Boston and came to paint for their art course. The notebook reveals that the artists have been experiencing frightening dreams, similar to those the investigators are experiencing, and have met Brian and Arthur Hall, who claim to have been experiencing the same dreams. The clearing also contains a blood-soaked tree with a body, Christopher Dobbs, and a cabin where Harris is hiding, attacking the investigators with a shotgun.",
