  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes three fictional weapons from the Call of Cthulhu universe: the Lightning Gun, the Mist Projector, and the Plutonian Drug. The Lightning Gun is a camera-shaped device that fires electricity, while the Mist Projector is a device that projects a cone of icy mist, dealing damage to targets. The Plutonian Drug, on the other hand, allows users to travel back in time, potentially encountering Mythos entities and gaining Cthulhu Mythos points. Each weapon has its own unique mechanics and effects, requiring investigators to use their skills and abilities to effectively utilize them.",
