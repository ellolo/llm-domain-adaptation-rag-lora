  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the \"Chase\" scenario of the Call of Cthulhu game, the pursuer quickly falls behind, and the Keeper describes how the pursuer loses their quarry. To determine the outcome, players make a Speed Roll, adjusting each participant's movement rating (MOV) for the duration of the chase. The fleeing character escapes if their adjusted MOV rating is higher than that of the pursuer, and the chase is over. The Keeper then moves the game on to the next point in the scenario, typically two locations behind the starting point, to \"cut to the chase\" and focus on the exciting part of the chase.",
