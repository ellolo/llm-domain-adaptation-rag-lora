  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, managing a character's finances is a crucial aspect of the game. The game introduces a spending limit, where characters must adhere to a daily spending limit, and can incur debt if they exceed it. Characters can also receive large sums of money, which can be invested or added to their cash reserves, and their financial situation can impact their Sanity and overall well-being. The game also introduces a Credit Rating system, where characters' financial situations can be adjusted based on their income, assets, and other factors.",
