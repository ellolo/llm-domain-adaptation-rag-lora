  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe \"Create Zombi\" spell is a variant of the \"Create Zombie\" spell, which corrupts a living person into a zombie servant. The spell costs 10 magic points and 10 Sanity points, and requires a paralyzing powder to be inhaled, followed by a successful POW roll to resist the effects of the spell. The spell can be used to create a zombie servant, which can obey simple commands, but can also be opposed by the target's CON and POW rolls. The spell's effects can be adjusted based on the game's balance and the caster's resources.",
