These specializations allow investigators to use specific types of firearms and determine their effectiveness in combat. Additionally, the First Aid skill enables investigators to provide emergency medical care, which can grant temporary hit points and stabilize dying characters. The effectiveness of these skills can be affected by the investigator's skill level, the situation, and the game's mechanics.",
