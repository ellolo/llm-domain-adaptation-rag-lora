  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nAtlach-Nacha, the Spider God, is a formidable foe in the game, capable of entangling and paralyzing victims with its web. Its attacks, including a paralyzing bite and web-slinging, can be devastating, and its ability to regenerate from damage makes it a resilient opponent. In contrast, Abhoth, a source of uncleanness, is an even more powerful and malevolent entity, capable of wrestling and absorbing victims, and regenerating from damage at an accelerated rate. Both creatures are formidable opponents that require careful strategy and tactics to defeat.",
