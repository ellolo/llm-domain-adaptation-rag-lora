  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nWhen a character is attacked, they can either fight back, dodge, or be caught off guard. If the character fights back, they roll percentile dice and compare their Fighting skill to the attacker's, with the better roll determining the outcome. If the character dodges, they also roll percentile dice and compare their Dodge skill to the attacker's, with the better roll determining the outcome. The amount of damage inflicted depends on the success of the roll and the type of attack, with extreme success resulting in maximum damage or impaling.",
