  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document outlines the rules for a skill system in a survival or wilderness-themed game, where players must use their skills to overcome challenges such as finding shelter, water, and food, as well as navigating extreme weather conditions and hostile environments. The system includes three main skills: Find/Make Shelter, Locate Water, and Sources of Food, with higher difficulty levels (Pushed) that simulate more extreme and high-stakes situations. The system also includes other skills such as Swim, Throw, and Push, which can be used in various situations to overcome challenges and avoid risks. The consequences of failing a Pushed roll can be severe, and the Keeper has the discretion to award modifiers and consequences based on the situation.",
