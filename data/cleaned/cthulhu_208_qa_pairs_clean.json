  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, the Keeper uses \"pick-up\" non-player characters (NPCs) to create tension and horror in the game. The NPCs are introduced to the investigators, but their true nature and connection to the main plot are not revealed until later, creating a sense of mystery and unease. The Keeper uses the investigators' backstories to inform the scenario, but also corrupts or distorts these entries to create a sense of madness and chaos. This technique can be used to build tension and boost the horror in the game, and can be applied to various aspects of the scenario.",
