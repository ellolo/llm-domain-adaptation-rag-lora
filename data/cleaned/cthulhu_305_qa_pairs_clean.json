  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines the \"Bind\" spell, a summoning and binding ritual used to control and command various supernatural creatures, known as \"monsters.\" The spell requires a caster to know the specific monster they wish to bind, as well as a suitable object (such as a whistle, knife, or dagger) imbued with magical properties. The caster must then succeed in an opposed POW roll to bind the monster, with the success of the binding also dependent on the caster's Sanity points and magic points. Each binding has its own unique requirements and benefits, and a bound creature cannot be re-bound until its current command is completed.",
