  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, players encounter a terrifying and grotesque creature, described as having a mass of wrinkles, sickly brown-green skin, and decaying flesh. To cope with this horror, players must make Sanity rolls, with success resulting in a loss of 1 point and failure resulting in a significant loss of Sanity points (1D10). The Keeper of the game must also manage the Sanity of their investigators, as excessive horror can cause them to faint or become temporarily insane. The game requires players to navigate the horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos, and the Keeper must be prepared to manage the psychological effects of these encounters.",
