  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nAs the Keeper in Call of Cthulhu, you have the responsibility to present the mystery and story during play, while also being the final arbiter of rules and outcomes. To effectively do this, you should have a good understanding of the game and its rules, as well as a familiarity with individual monster and spell descriptions. New Keepers can start with the Quick-Start Rules or Amidst the Ancient Trees scenario, while experienced Keepers can integrate the new rules and modifications into their existing games. The key is to listen to your players and adapt to their actions, and to be prepared to address any rules questions that arise during play.",
