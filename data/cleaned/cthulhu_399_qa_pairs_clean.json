  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, ghosts are a type of supernatural entity that can be crafted by the Keeper to fit the scenario. Ghosts are typically dim, misty forms that haunt specific locations or objects, and may possess special powers such as manipulating the environment or draining the victim's POW. The Keeper can use ghosts to create unique and challenging mysteries, and can determine how a ghost can be laid to rest through various means such as destroying its source of attachment or exorcising it. Ghosts can also be used to create spooky scenarios and entire campaigns can be devoted to their study and exorcism.",
