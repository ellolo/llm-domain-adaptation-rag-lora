  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe body of Professor Charles Leiter has been discovered in the Medical School facilities at Miskatonic University, and Dean Fallon has ordered its cremation. However, the true cause of Leiter's death is unknown, and the death certificate only mentions \"massive and sudden heart failure.\" The body is now in cold storage, and the university is trying to cover up the circumstances surrounding Leiter's death. The university's doctor, Wheatcroft, is anxious to get rid of the body and is reluctant to discuss the matter, but may become more helpful if convinced by investigators.",
