  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document outlines the rules for skill use in a game, specifically for investigators. It explains that investigators can specialize in specific skills, such as Art and Craft, Fighting, and Science, and that some skills have transferable skills and knowledge. The Keeper has the discretion to apply the rules regarding skill use in specific situations, and may allow the use of alternate specializations at increased difficulty levels. The document also provides guidelines for determining the difficulty level of a skill, including the opposition skill and the required difficulty level for a Regular or Hard success.",
