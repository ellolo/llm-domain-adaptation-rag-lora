  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines the rules for firearms attacks in a game, including difficulty levels, modifiers, and resolution procedures. The difficulty level of a firearms attack is determined by the range, with extreme difficulty occurring at very long range. Modifiers include bonus and penalty dice, which can be applied to the difficulty level or attack rolls, and specific conditions such as aiming, point-blank range, and fast-moving targets. The document also provides rules for full auto and burst fire, including the number of bullets fired and the difficulty level of the attack.",
