  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this game, First Aid is a crucial skill that can save a dying character's life, but only if administered by a successful roll. The skill is opposed by Regular difficulty, and pushing examples can make the situation worse, causing additional damage. If the character survives, they must receive a successful Medicine roll to recover fully. Additionally, the game includes other skills such as Hypnosis, which can induce a trancelike state and reduce mental trauma, and History, which can help recall important information.",
