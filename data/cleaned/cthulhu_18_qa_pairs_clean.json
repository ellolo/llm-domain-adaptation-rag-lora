  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nAugust Derleth played a crucial role in keeping the works of H.P. Lovecraft in print after his death, founding Arkham House Publishing and contributing to the expansion of the Cthulhu Mythos. Derleth's additions to the Mythos, such as the character of Hastur, were well-received and helped to cement Lovecraft's legacy. Lovecraft himself was a prolific writer, producing some of his most memorable tales in his later years, despite struggling with health issues and personal difficulties. His unique blend of science, philosophy, and imagination continues to fascinate readers to this day.",
