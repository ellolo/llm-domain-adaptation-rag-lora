  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document appears to be a reference chart for vehicles in a tabletop game, specifically detailing their speed, maneuverability, and strength (or \"build\") ratings. The chart categorizes vehicles into different types, including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and watercraft, and assigns them specific ratings for movement and build. The ratings are used to determine the outcomes of vehicle-to-vehicle collisions in the game, with higher ratings indicating more severe damage. The chart also includes information on vehicles that require specialized skills to operate, such as tanks and aircraft carriers.",
