  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document discusses the concept of an \"Idea roll\" in a game, which allows players to gain a clue regardless of their previous attempts to obtain it. The Keeper sets a difficulty level for the Idea roll based on the importance of the clue, with more obvious clues requiring higher difficulty levels. This approach encourages players to take risks and gamble on the outcome, adding an element of uncertainty and excitement to the game. By incorporating player suggestions and adding complications, the Keeper can create a more dynamic and engaging experience.",
