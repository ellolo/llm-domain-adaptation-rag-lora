  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document appears to be a magical grimoire, detailing various spells and incantations from the Mythos, a fictional universe. The main topic is magical protection and control, with spells such as the Great Ward of Naach-Tith, which creates a barrier to protect against harm, and Dominate, which allows the caster to control a target's actions. Other spells, such as the Dust of Suleiman, create harm to unnatural beings, while the Dread Curse of Azathoth drains a target's POW. The grimoire also includes information on the casting costs, times, and effects of these spells.",
