  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nA Call of Cthulhu campaign can be structured as a series of connected scenarios, each with its own theme and story-arc, linked together by a central horror or mystery. The investigators can explore the edges of the Mythos, gathering clues and knowledge, before working their way inward to uncover the truth. To create a sandbox scenario, the game master can focus on creating a few key locations and non-player characters, rather than detailed descriptions of each setting. This allows the investigators to explore and discover the plot in any order they like, with the goal of ultimately facing the source of the evil.",
