  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Star Vampire and Tcho-Tcho are two supernatural entities from the Cthulhu Mythos. The Star Vampire is a creature that remains visible for six rounds after feeding, allowing it to attack at a normal chance to hit. It has a range of abilities, including talon attacks, bite attacks, and spells, which can drain the life force of its victims. In contrast, the Tcho-Tcho is a hybrid race of humans and amphibians, cursed with half-normal sanity at birth, and are known for their cruelty and worship of dark gods. Both entities are formidable opponents, with the Star Vampire's ability to drain life force and the Tcho-Tcho's savage nature and access to dark magic.",
