  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines the rules for identifying and using languages in a fictional setting, specifically in a game or simulation. To identify a language, investigators can use various skills, including a Know roll for unknown languages, an Archaelogy or History roll for extinct languages, and a Cthulhu Mythos or Occult roll for alien languages. The difficulty level of using a language can range from regular conversation to hard difficulty, with pushing examples that require more time and effort to complete. Failing to use a language correctly can have consequences, such as misinterpreting laws or breaking the law.",
