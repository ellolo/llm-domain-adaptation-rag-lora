The Death Spell causes a victim to burst into flames, while the Deeper Version prolongs the suffering over several days. The Dominate spell bends the will of a target to the caster's commands. These spells are reserved for powerful sorcerers and are designed to harm or control extraterrestrial and other planar beings.",
