  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nGhouls are supernatural humanoids with rubbery skin, canine features, and claws, often found in tunnel systems beneath cities, particularly graveyards and ancient catacombs. They possess a 15% chance of knowing spells and have a unique set of abilities, including the ability to bite and hold victims, causing damage over time. Ghouls are also known to have commerce with witches and those seeking dark pleasures, and are often feared by humans due to their unsettling appearance and deadly attacks. Additionally, ghouls may be the physical manifestation of the myth of the changeling, where humans are replaced by supernatural beings.",
