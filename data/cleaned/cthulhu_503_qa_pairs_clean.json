  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines the rules for vehicular movement and hazards in a Call of Cthulhu game. Players can move their vehicles up to 5 locations per turn, with options to accelerate or decelerate, and can encounter various hazards such as Regular, Hard, and Extreme hazards. The severity of these hazards is determined by a random roll, and the vehicle's movement speed and armor can affect the outcome. Additionally, the document provides rules for handling vehicular collisions, including damage and destruction of vehicles.",
