The investigators must decide whether to try to gain entry or take a more cautious approach. If they gain access, they may be introduced to Carl White, the site foreman, who explains the purpose of the dig site and warns them about the dangers of the site. The investigators' actions will determine the outcome of their encounter with the undead servants and the site's foreman.",
