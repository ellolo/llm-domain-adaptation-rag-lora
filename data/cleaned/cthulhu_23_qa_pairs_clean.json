  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, the Great Old Ones and Outer Gods are depicted as monstrous alien beings that occasionally intervene in human affairs, but their actions are often isolated and neglectful of humanity. The organization, hierarchy, and allegiances of Mythos races should be mysterious and inhuman, rather than being classified into divisions of Servitor and Independent. The document also explores the history of the Earth, including the elder things, the Great Race of Yith, and the star-spawn of Cthulhu, which have all played a role in shaping the planet's evolution. These ancient beings have interacted with other alien species, some of which have been able to hold their own against the Great Old Ones.",
