  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this game, the Keeper (game moderator) plays the role of non-player characters, including NPCs like a maid or a barkeep. The Keeper's role is to reinforce the importance of roleplaying in the game, using voice, gestures, and mannerisms to create a mental image of the character. The Keeper should also try to bring back established NPCs to build consistency and continuity in the game, and may reward strong roleplaying with benefits such as lower difficulty levels or special treatment. The Keeper's goal is to create a immersive experience for the players, who should model their performances on the Keeper's example.",
