  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, investigators can use a skill called \"Occult\" to recognize and understand occult paraphernalia, folklore, and secret knowledge. This skill can be pushed to a higher level, but failing a pushed roll can have disastrous consequences, such as misremembering information or performing a ritual incorrectly. The skill is opposed by other skills like Charm, Fast Talk, and Intimidate, and pushing examples include taking more time to study a site or item, conducting further research, or consulting an expert.",
