  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, three investigators (Brian, Scott, and Harvey) are being pursued by three cultists after fleeing their apartment through a window. The Keeper determines the speed of each character and sets up the chase, with Scott as the fastest pursuer and Harvey as the slowest quarry. The chase takes place in an alleyway, with hazards such as a fence and the window serving as obstacles for both the pursuers and the fleeing characters. The Keeper will guide the players through the chase, determining the outcome based on the characters' speeds and movements.",
