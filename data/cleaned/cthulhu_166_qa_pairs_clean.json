  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the Keeper explains the mechanics of a \"Bout of Madness\" in a horror investigation game. When an investigator experiences a bout of madness, they enter a state of temporary insanity, losing control of their actions and decisions. The Keeper describes the scene and the investigator's actions, while the player is left to roleplay the investigator's behavior during the bout of madness. After the initial bout of madness, the investigator enters a lower-level state of \"underlying insanity,\" where they are still under the player's control but may exhibit erratic behavior.",
