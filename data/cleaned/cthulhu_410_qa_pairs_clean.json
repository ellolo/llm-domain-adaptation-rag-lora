  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document appears to be a stat block for a Gray Wolf creature in a tabletop role-playing game, likely set in a Lovecraftian horror setting. The creature's stats include its damage output, movement speed, and fighting abilities. The document also touches on the broader topic of the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe created by H.P. Lovecraft that explores themes of cosmic horror and the unknown. The Cthulhu Mythos is characterized by its inconsistencies and contradictions, which make it a fertile ground for creative interpretation and storytelling. The document encourages game masters to feel empowered to create their own unique stories within this shared universe.",
