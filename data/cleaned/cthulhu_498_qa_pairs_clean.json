  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, firearms combat is resolved through a combination of a 1D100 roll and the attacker's Firearms skill. The difficulty level is determined by the range and other factors, and a failure never deals damage. Armor can reduce the damage received, with different types of armor providing varying levels of protection. Additionally, characters can use their escape route to flee melee combat on their turn, and some entities can never be outnumbered.",
