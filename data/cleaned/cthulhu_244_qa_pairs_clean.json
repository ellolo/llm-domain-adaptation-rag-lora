  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, non-linear adventures offer players the freedom to explore and discover interconnected plots, allowing the Keeper to accommodate unexpected story developments. This approach creates a collaborative storytelling experience between the Keeper and players, as the players' choices and actions shape the narrative. Non-linear adventures differ from linear ones, where the story is driven by a predetermined sequence of events, and instead, allow for a more flexible and dynamic storytelling experience. The Keeper must be prepared to adapt the timeline and plot elements in response to the players' actions, creating a unique and exciting experience for all involved.",
