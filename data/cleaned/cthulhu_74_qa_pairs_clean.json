  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document discusses the concept of \"Pushing\" in a game or simulation, where the player must manipulate machinery or vehicles to achieve specific tasks, such as landing an aircraft or unearthing delicate objects. Pushing involves using reasoning, debate, and discussion to convince others of a particular idea or concept, and can be employed without reference to truth. The document also outlines the consequences of failing a Pushed roll, which can result in damage to the craft, injury, or even death. Additionally, it introduces the concept of Piloting, which involves understanding and navigating different types of aircraft, including aircraft, boats, and balloons.",
