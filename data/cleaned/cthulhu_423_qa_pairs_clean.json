  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, the investigators are on the hunt for Harris, but stumble upon a dead body with a mysterious connection to the artists' camp. The body's presence may trigger a psychic disturbance caused by Gla'aki's presence, leading to bad dreams and potential Sanity losses. The investigators must decide whether to follow the dead man's tracks or continue their pursuit of Harris, while also navigating the dangers of the forest, including the possibility of encountering a black bear or being mistaken for kidnappers. The Keeper must use their discretion to determine the consequences of the investigators' actions and the unfolding events.",
