  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the role-playing game Call of Cthulhu, investigators' characteristics are generated through rolling dice and multiplying the results by 5. These characteristics, such as Strength (STR), Constitution (CON), Size (SIZ), Dexterity (DEX), Appearance (APP), and Intelligence (INT), determine various aspects of an investigator's abilities and traits. Unlike many other games, low characteristic scores in Call of Cthulhu do not necessarily hinder an investigator's success, and can be incorporated into their backstory to make them more realistic and relatable.",
