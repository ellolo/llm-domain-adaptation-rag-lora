  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the Keeper of a Lovecraftian game explains the rules for studying Mythos Tomes, which are books that contain forbidden knowledge from the Cthulhu Mythos. To study a tome, the player must make an initial reading roll, which can be pushed if they have prior knowledge or preparation. After the initial reading, the player can continue to study the tome, which can take months, and must eventually make a roll to determine the Sanity point loss. The tome's Mythos rating is compared to the player's Cthulhu Mythos skill, and the player gains skill points if they succeed.",
