  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Call of Cthulhu role-playing game is a cooperative game where players work together to achieve a common goal, often thwarting a nefarious plot by a dark cult or secret society. The game's outcome depends on the investigators' success in achieving their goal, with failure resulting in loss and potential death. Players can gain power and advancement as they progress through the game, with the ultimate goal of repelling the cosmic horrors of the universe. The game is typically led by a Keeper, who controls non-player characters and monsters, and the players' investigators can suffer injuries, sanity-shattering experiences, or death.",
