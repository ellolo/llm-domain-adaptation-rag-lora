  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, the effects of poisons are categorized into four bands: very mild, mild, strong, and lethal. Each band has different effects on the victim, including physical damage and symptoms. The speed and severity of the poison's effects depend on the administration method and the Keeper's discretion. Poisons can also cause temporary unconsciousness, and characters may attempt to purge the poison through various methods, such as vomiting or bloodletting. The Keeper's judgment plays a significant role in determining the effects of poisons on the game.",
