  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the \"Chasing the Kidnapper\" scenario, investigators are tasked with tracking down Eugene, who has kidnapped Jane Strong. Eugene's injuries and combat penalties make him a formidable opponent, and he will try to flee or surrender if cornered. If caught, Eugene will claim Harris was involved in the kidnapping and provide directions to the hideout cabin, where Jane is being held. The investigators must then decide whether to follow Eugene's directions or pursue Harris' tracks, all while navigating the dangers of the forest.",
