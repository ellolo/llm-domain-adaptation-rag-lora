  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis chapter of the Call of Cthulhu game provides a selection of monsters, beasts, and alien beings for use in the game. The chapter is divided into four sections, each focusing on a specific type of monster, and includes characteristics such as STR, CON, SIZ, POW, INT, and DEX. The chapter also introduces the concept of \"build\" values, which provide a scale for determining a monster's physical capabilities, such as lifting and throwing objects. Keepers can modify and alter these characteristics to create unique and terrifying monsters.",
