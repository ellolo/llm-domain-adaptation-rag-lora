  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a chase scene, the Keeper should divide the chase into narrative chunks, or \"locations,\" which can be separated by physical barriers or obstacles, rather than being a set physical distance. The Keeper should track the movement of characters, with faster characters moving more locations per round, and use a system to keep track of the chase, such as a grid of dots or miniatures. The order of movement is determined by the characters' DEX scores, with the highest DEX character going first. Each character has a limited number of movement actions per round, which they can use to move from one location to the next.",
