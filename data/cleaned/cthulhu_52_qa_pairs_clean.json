  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the concept of a \"Pushed roll\" is introduced, which refers to a high-risk, high-reward task that requires an investigator to take a significant amount of time and effort to complete successfully. Failing a Pushed roll can have severe consequences, such as being attacked or imprisoned by the people or animals being studied, or destroying valuable artifacts. The document outlines the consequences of failing a Pushed roll in various skills, including archaeology, anthropology, and animal handling. It also highlights the importance of taking the time to study and research the subject matter, as well as consulting with experts, to increase the chances of success.",
