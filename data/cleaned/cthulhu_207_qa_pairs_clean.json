  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game Call of Cthulhu, differentiating between non-player characters (NPCs) can be challenging. To overcome this, Keepers can use portraits or images of NPCs to help players identify them, or create their own characters using online resources. Additionally, Keepers can prepare lists of names for NPCs to make them feel more real and central to the plot. The game also allows players to take on the roles of NPCs, providing a unique perspective and conflict of knowledge that can enhance the roleplaying experience.",
