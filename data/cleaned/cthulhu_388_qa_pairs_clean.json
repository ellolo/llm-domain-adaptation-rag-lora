  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nShub-Niggurath, also known as the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, is a powerful deity in the Cthulhu Mythos. She is often summoned by worshipers to grant them aid, but can also be summoned by non-worshipers to attack them. Shub-Niggurath is a formidable foe, capable of draining the life force of her victims with her tentacles, and can also trample and devour her enemies. Her powers are fueled by the sacrifice of her victims, and she can be hurt or dismissed by those who know her summoning spell.",
