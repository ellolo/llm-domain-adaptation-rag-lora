  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, a bout of madness can occur when an investigator is exposed to a traumatic or disturbing experience, causing them to lose control and become insane for a set period of time, typically 1D10 hours. During this time, the investigator may act rationally but outwardly appear insane, and their actions are influenced by their phobias or manias. The Keeper can adapt the outcome to accommodate the situation, and the player may regain control of the investigator once they recover from their bout of madness. The duration of the insanity can be indefinite or temporary, depending on the scenario.",
