  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Call of Cthulhu document outlines various skills for investigators in a fictional setting, including Dodge, Drive Auto, and Electrical Repair. Dodge allows characters to evade attacks, while Drive Auto enables them to drive vehicles safely and evade pursuers. Electrical Repair, on the other hand, enables characters to repair and reconfigure electrical equipment, including modern explosives. The skills have different difficulty levels, ranging from regular to hard, and can be pushed to increase the challenge.",
