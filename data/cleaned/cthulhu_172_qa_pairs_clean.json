  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the concept of insanity and its effects on characters in a game is explored. Insanity can manifest in various ways, including phobias, manias, and delusions, which can impact a character's actions and decisions. The \"Insanity Side-Effects\" section explains how the Keeper can present an investigator with delusional sensory information, requiring the player to make a \"Reality Check\" to determine what is real. This mechanic allows the Keeper to create a more immersive and unpredictable game world.",
