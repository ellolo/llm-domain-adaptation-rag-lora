  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, two terrifying enemies are the Fire Vampire and the Flying Polyp. The Fire Vampire attacks by touching its victims, causing heat-shock damage and attempting to steal magic points, while the Flying Polyp is an alien entity that can control the winds and phase in and out of visibility, making it a formidable opponent. The Flying Polyp has special abilities, including invisibility and the power to cast spells, which can be used to evade attacks or target its victims. Both enemies have unique weaknesses and resistances, making them challenging to defeat.",
