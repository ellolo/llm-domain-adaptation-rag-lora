  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, the game master (Keeper) must make decisions about how to handle various situations, such as a character drowning or being strangled, and when to introduce custom rules. The game is designed to be flexible and encourage creative use of the core rules, rather than relying on a comprehensive list of every possible scenario. To create custom rules, the Keeper should consider whether a standard rule can handle the situation equally well and whether the custom rule will significantly enhance the game. In some cases, custom rules can be used to emphasize key characteristics, such as CON for dehydration and fatigue in a desert scenario.",
