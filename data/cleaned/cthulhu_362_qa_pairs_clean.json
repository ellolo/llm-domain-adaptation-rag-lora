  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu universe, the Star Spawn of Cthulhu and Star Vampires are powerful, otherworldly beings that serve as minions of the Great Old One, Cthulhu. These entities are capable of immense destruction, with the Star Spawn possessing magical powers and the ability to regenerate from injuries. They are normally invisible, but can be summoned and controlled by powerful wizards, and their presence is often signaled by a ghoulish tittering sound. The Star Spawn are also capable of feeding on human blood, which can reveal their presence and make them visible for a short time.",
