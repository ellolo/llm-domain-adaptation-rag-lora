  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, Credit Rating is a gauge of an investigator's financial wealth and can be used to gauge first impressions. A high Credit Rating can be a useful resource, but it should be earned through skill points. Credit Rating can change over time, influenced by factors such as employment, insanity, and financial decisions. The skill is also tied to the Cthulhu Mythos, where exposure to it can undermine human sanity and lead to loss of employment.",
