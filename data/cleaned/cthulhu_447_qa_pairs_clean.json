  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe theft of the Witch Trial Papers is a significant event in the scenario, and the Keeper has several options to rectify the situation. One possible culprit is Emilia Court, a rival academic with a dark heart, who may have stolen the papers to safeguard them after discovering Leiter's forgery ring. Alternatively, Harland Roach, a paunchy and disheveled academic, may have stolen the papers for himself, but instead uncovered their missing status. The Keeper can choose to pursue either of these suspects, with the option to use the Court's possible forerunner, Keziah Mason, as a character with Cthulhu Mythos skills and spells.",
