  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this combat scenario, a gangster opens fire on a group of investigators, including Harvey, Cecil, and Rodger, in a warehouse. The gangster uses his submachine gun to attack the investigators, with varying degrees of success. Cecil is killed outright, while Harvey takes cover behind a car and later breaks cover to punch the gangster, who is momentarily incapacitated by a malfunctioning gun. The scenario highlights the importance of positioning, cover, and the use of penalty dice to determine the success of attacks.",
