  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Arkham Witch Trial Papers are a collection of personal correspondence between jurist Caleb Hobbhouse and notable authorities in colonial New England, dating back to the 1690s. The letters discuss the Witch Trials, the causes and nature of the witch-panic, and Hobbhouse's fears of the escape of evil instigators. The papers also contain geometric formulae and diagrams, which are believed to be from the possession of convicted witch Keziah Mason. The documents are connected to a larger Cthulhu Mythos story, in which the investigators must uncover the truth behind the Witch Trials and the mysterious formulae.",
