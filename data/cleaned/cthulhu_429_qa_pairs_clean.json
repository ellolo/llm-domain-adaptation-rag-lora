  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe investigators are being stalked by Gla'aki, a powerful undead deity, and its minions, who are attempting to convert them to their cause. The minions, August and Jacob, are cunning and aim to entice the investigators to their master's lake, where they will be imprisoned and eventually converted. The investigators can avoid combat by avoiding the minions during the day, but if they start a fight or try to leave, the minions will attack and try to incapacitate them before imprisoning them in caskets. The caskets are enchanted and require a high STR or POW to open, and the investigators will find various items and clues inside, including a mysterious spine and a diary belonging to one of Gla'aki's servants.",
