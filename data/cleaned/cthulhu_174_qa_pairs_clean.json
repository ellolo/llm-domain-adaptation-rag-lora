  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, a character's sanity can be affected by various stimuli, including non-Mythos-related traumas, Mythos-induced events, and delusions. When a character experiences Mythos-related insanity, their Cthulhu Mythos skill increases, reflecting their growing knowledge of the Mythos. Conversely, delusions caused by Mythos entities can lead to Sanity point loss, which can be mitigated by successful reality checks. The severity of these effects depends on the character's Cthulhu Mythos skill and the nature of the stimulus.",
