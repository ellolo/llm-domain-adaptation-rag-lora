  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu mythos, Hastur and Ithaqua are two of the most feared deities. Hastur, known as \"He Who Is Not to Be Named,\" is a malevolent being who can only be summoned at night and is known for his brutal attacks on those within 20 yards of him. Ithaqua, on the other hand, is a monstrous entity from the far north, known for stalking and devouring travelers, and is often worshiped in the distant world of Borea. Both deities are formidable and feared by many, with Hastur's cult being particularly loathsome.",
