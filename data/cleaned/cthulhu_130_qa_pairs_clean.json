  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, administering successful first aid is crucial for saving characters from death. To do so, players must make a CON (constitution) roll at the end of each round, with failure resulting in death. Major wound healing requires a CON roll at the end of each week, with success healing a set amount of hit points and potentially erasing the wound marker. The game also allows for variations in healing, such as bonus dice for well-cared-for patients or penalty dice for poor conditions.",
