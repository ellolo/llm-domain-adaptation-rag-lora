  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game, the Keeper has the flexibility to control the investigators' actions when they fail a Sanity roll, simulating the loss of self-control and potential harm to themselves or others. This allows the Keeper to create a more horror-themed experience, as the investigators' involuntary actions can lead to unexpected and terrifying consequences. The Keeper can also use this opportunity to provide subtle hints to the players, such as cautioning them against rushing into a potentially deadly situation. This approach enables the Keeper to balance player agency with the need to create a frightening atmosphere.",
