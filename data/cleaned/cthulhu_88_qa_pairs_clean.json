  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, a tabletop role-playing game, failure can be a crucial aspect of gameplay. When a player fails to achieve a goal, the Keeper (game moderator) can describe the consequences of that failure, which can range from minor setbacks to severe outcomes. The Keeper has the discretion to determine the severity of the failure, and the player may be given the opportunity to \"push\" the roll, attempting to overcome the failure with additional effort or risk. Pushing a roll can lead to more severe consequences if the player fails again, and the Keeper should justify the action taken to push the situation.",
