Fungi from Yuggoth are humanoid creatures with crab-like claws, capable of seizing and flying, dealing moderate damage in hand-to-hand combat. Nightgaunts, on the other hand, are faceless, winged creatures that serve Nodens, attacking in groups and using their paws, horns, and tails to overpower victims. Both creatures have unique abilities and characteristics that make them formidable opponents in combat.",
