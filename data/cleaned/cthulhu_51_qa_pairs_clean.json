  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document appears to be a skill list for a tabletop role-playing game, detailing various skills and their corresponding difficulty levels. The skills cover a range of topics, including physics, psychology, anthropology, accounting, and animal handling. Each skill has a regular difficulty level and a \"pushed\" difficulty level, which is increased when the investigator has more time to study or prepare. The document also includes examples of consequences for failing a pushed roll, such as alerting enemies or destroying important documents.",
