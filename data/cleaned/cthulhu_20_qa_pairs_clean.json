  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nH.P. Lovecraft's works, particularly the Cthulhu Mythos, have been widely adapted into films and other media, introducing his Lovecraftian themes and ideas to a mainstream audience. Lovecraft's stories explore the idea that humanity's desire for truth and knowledge can lead to madness and destruction, and that the universe is governed by powerful, alien beings that are often incomprehensible to humans. The Cthulhu Mythos is a complex and multifaceted narrative that encompasses various stories, essays, and ideas, and is characterized by its mysterious and contradictory nature. Key concepts in the Mythos include the existence of gods and Great Old Ones, and the idea that humans are fragile and vulnerable in the face of cosmic forces.",
