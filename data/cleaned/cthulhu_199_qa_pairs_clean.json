  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, creating investigators is a crucial aspect of the game. To create engaging investigators, game masters should provide players with an initial premise, including the date, location, and basic description of the scenario, as well as suggested professions and how the investigators know each other. This information can be used to create motivation for the investigators to follow the story path and become integrated into the plot. Game masters can also use various techniques, such as introducing a family member or friend in jeopardy, to create emotional connections between the investigators and the scenario.",
