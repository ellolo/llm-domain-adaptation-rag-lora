It explains that a number preceding a dice notation indicates the number of dice to be rolled, and that additions or subtractions are shown using a plus or minus sign. The document also touches on the use of investigator sheets, which record player details, and the optional use of miniatures, tokens, and props to enhance gameplay. Additionally, it notes that the Keeper can use graph paper or plain paper to sketch out the game area or encounter.",
