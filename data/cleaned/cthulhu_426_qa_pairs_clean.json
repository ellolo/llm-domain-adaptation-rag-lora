  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this scenario, the investigators are navigating a forest-based terrain, where they must contend with obstacles such as steep slopes, brooks, and dense young trees. They are being pursued by a zombie-like creature, Louis, who will attempt to escape or attack if cornered. The investigators will also encounter a rival group of posse teams, who are fleeing the forest and may be hiding their true intentions. As the investigators progress, they will experience the effects of Gla'aki's Dream Call, which will distort their perception of reality.",
