  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a horror game like Call of Cthulhu, the Keeper's role is to create a terrifying experience for the investigators. When a player describes an action that goes beyond mere color, the Keeper must decide whether to accept, veto, or adapt the description, using judgment and discretion to balance the player's creativity with the game's mechanics and horror theme. Pushed rolls, where a player attempts to overcome an obstacle, should be possible but also come with consequences that escalate the horror and tension. The Keeper's goal is to steer the game towards the theme of horror, using pushed rolls as opportunities to create unsettling and terrifying situations.",
