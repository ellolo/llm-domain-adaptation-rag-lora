The scenario is designed for 2-5 investigators, with a preference for those with an academic or antiquarian background, and requires some preparation and decision-making by the Keeper. The investigation is shrouded in strange events, greed, and obsession, and may lead to charges of misappropriation and theft, as well as uncovering dark secrets about Leiter's double life. The scenario is non-linear and can be played over several sessions, allowing for a more rewarding experience.",
