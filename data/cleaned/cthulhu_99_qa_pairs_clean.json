  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the Keeper explains the rules for skill checks in a game system, specifically when to use sequential skill rolls versus a combined skill roll. The Keeper also outlines the process for the Investigator's Development Phase, where the player earns experience points by successfully using skills in play. The document explains how to track the Investigator's skill levels, including how to improve or maintain them, and provides guidelines for when to call for a Development Phase. Additionally, it clarifies the rules for skills such as Charm, Fast Talk, and Intimidate, and how to determine the difficulty level of a skill check.",
