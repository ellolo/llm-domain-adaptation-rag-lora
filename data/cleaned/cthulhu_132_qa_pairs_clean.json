  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines a system for determining the severity of injuries in a Call of Cthulhu game, with a focus on realistic and detailed descriptions of potential harm. The system categorizes injuries into four levels: Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Deadly, with corresponding damage rolls and potential outcomes. The document also introduces additional factors, such as environmental hazards and poisons, which can further exacerbate injuries. Additionally, it discusses the concept of \"knock-out blows,\" where a character is knocked unconscious due to significant damage.",
