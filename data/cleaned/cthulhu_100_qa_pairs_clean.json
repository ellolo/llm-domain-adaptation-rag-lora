  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, the Investigator Development Phase is a time for players to improve their skills, gain Sanity points, and manage their finances. Skills above 90% can be improved by rolling 1D10, adding points to the skill, and gaining Sanity points. Additionally, players can also gain Sanity points through spending time with aspects from their backstory, check their Credit Rating, and reduce their Sanity limits. The game also allows players to alter their Investigator's backstory and manage their finances, with guidelines provided for these activities.",
