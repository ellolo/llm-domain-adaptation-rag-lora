  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu game, chases can be a thrilling and unpredictable aspect of gameplay. The document outlines optional rules for enhancing and developing chases, including the ability for the quarry to make split-second decisions about their route, and the introduction of random hazards and barriers that can be used to create tension and obstacles. The Keeper can use a random roll to determine the type and severity of these hazards, with higher rolls resulting in more challenging obstacles. This adds an element of unpredictability and excitement to the chase, making it more immersive and engaging for players.",
