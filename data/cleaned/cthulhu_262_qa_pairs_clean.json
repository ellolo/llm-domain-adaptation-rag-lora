The texts include the Necronomicon, a book of dark knowledge, and other volumes such as \"Call of Cthulhu\" and \"Ponape Scripture\", which are said to hold secrets and knowledge of the deep ones. The catalog also mentions the Pnakotic Manuscripts, a precursor volume to the Necronomicon, and the Ponape Scripture, which details a South Sea islander cult that worships and breeds with the deep ones. Each text is described in terms of its condition, rarity, and mythos rating, which indicates its level of connection to the Cthulhu Mythos.",
