  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Hounds of Tindalos are ancient, immortal creatures that dwell in the angles of time, pursuing victims through space and time to obtain something from humanity. They can materialize through any sharp corner and are driven off by their targets, but can be difficult to repel. These creatures are known for their razor-sharp teeth, claws, and pulsating blue-tinged skin, and are capable of inflicting significant damage. They possess magical abilities, including spells that can be cast by each hound, and can leave behind a gout of bluish pus, known as ichor, after attacking their victims.",
