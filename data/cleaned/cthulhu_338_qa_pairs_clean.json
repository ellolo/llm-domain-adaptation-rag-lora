  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nFlying polyps are a type of monster that can attack with their tentacles or use wind-based attacks. They have a 70% chance of knowing spells, which can be used to damage their targets. Polyps can use various wind-based attacks, including Wind Blast, Fixing Attack, and Windstorm Attack, each with its own unique effects and limitations. These attacks can be used to damage and immobilize their targets, and the polyps can also move quickly and chase down their prey. The attacks and abilities of flying polyps are influenced by their physical and magical attributes, such as their strength, magic points, and power.",
