  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe scenario \"The Ticking Bomb\" involves a countdown to a catastrophic event, where a set of papers known as the Witch Trial Papers has unleashed a horror beyond human control. The investigators must navigate the complex web of characters and secrets surrounding the death of Charles Leiter, who was involved in the project to assay and collate the papers. The scenario's outcome is determined by the investigators' actions and decisions, and the Keeper can use a deadline to add an element of urgency. The key to solving the mystery lies in extracting information from non-player characters and employing communication skills such as Fast Talk, Persuade, Charm, Intimidate, and Psychology.",
