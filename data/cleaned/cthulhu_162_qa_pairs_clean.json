  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, the Cthulhu Mythos has a corrupting influence on investigators, lowering their maximum Sanity points. Insanity is induced by traumatic experiences and the ghastly comprehension of the Mythos, leading to three states of insanity: temporary, indefinite, and permanent. The duration of insanity depends on the number of Sanity points lost, with temporary insanity requiring a successful Intelligence (INT) roll to recover. The document outlines the point costs for various Sanity-related events, which can contribute to the development of insanity in investigators.",
