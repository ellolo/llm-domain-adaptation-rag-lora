  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a Lovecraftian horror game, investigators must be motivated to connect with the plot, and their background and backstory can help drive this motivation. The Keeper can use the investigators' backstories to create connections between the character and the Mythos, and can also introduce non-player characters (NPCs) to create conflicts and challenges for the investigators. NPCs can be created through the investigators' suggestions, existing published scenarios, or improvised by the Keeper, and their skills and characteristics can be used to determine the difficulty level of interactions with the investigators. The Keeper's goal is to create an immersive and challenging experience for the players.",
