  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game system, the age of an investigator affects their characteristics and skills. The Keeper determines the modifications to the investigator's characteristics based on their age, with different age ranges resulting in varying deductions and improvements. For example, younger investigators (15-19 years old) may have reduced physical attributes, while older investigators (60+ years old) may have reduced physical attributes and increased mental attributes. The game also uses a system of \"half\" and \"fifth\" values, which are calculated based on the investigator's characteristic values, to determine skill and attribute levels.",
