  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Lovecraftian universe, various alien species and servitors coexist with humans, often interacting with each other in complex ways. These species can be broadly categorized into two groups: servitors, which are often bound to serve specific gods or entities, and independent races, which have their own agendas and motivations. The independent races include various species such as dholes, flying polyps, and shoggoths, which have interacted with humans and other species throughout Earth's history. These interactions have shaped the planet's ecosystem and influenced the development of human civilization. The Lovecraftian universe is characterized by a complex web of relationships between humans, aliens, and supernatural entities.",
