  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe King in Yellow is a monstrous entity from a fictional universe, characterized by a pallid mask and razor-sharp tatters that can cause damage to those around him. He possesses a gaze attack that induces paroxysms of fear, costing the target 1D6 Sanity points per round, and can also use his tattered robes as pseudopodia to attack. The King in Yellow is also associated with the Yellow Sign, a mysterious symbol that holds great power and significance for those learned in the occult, and can cause a loss of Sanity points to those who see it. Those who encounter the King in Yellow are often driven to madness, and the entity is said to be a servant of the alien god Hastur.",
