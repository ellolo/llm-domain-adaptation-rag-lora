  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game system, opposed rolls are used to determine the outcome of events, such as wooing a lady or resolving a conflict. When one player makes an opposed roll, the Keeper may award a bonus die or penalty die to the other player's roll, depending on the circumstances. The use of bonus and penalty dice is intended to add nuance and realism to the game, but should be used sparingly and only when the factor is significant enough to impact the outcome. The Keeper's discretion is key in determining when to award bonus or penalty dice, and the game system emphasizes setting difficulty levels for skill rolls rather than using dice.",
