  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nAs a Keeper in a Call of Cthulhu game, your role is to manage the game and its multiple players, rather than focusing solely on individual players. To achieve this, you must be able to handle conflicts, manage investigator locations, and balance the flow of the game with the needs of all players. Effective communication and attention to detail are crucial, as you must direct the spotlight to different players and ensure that all players are engaged and active throughout the game. By taking control of the game's narrative and structure, you can create a cohesive and engaging experience for all players.",
