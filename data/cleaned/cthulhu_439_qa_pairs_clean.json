  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Miskatonic University has acquired a vast collection of historical documents, diaries, and artifacts from a recently deceased octogenarian bachelor. The collection, which includes papers from the 1690s Arkham Witch Trials, was initially assessed by the university's legal firm, but its true value and significance were soon realized by Leiter, a faculty member. Leiter attempted to sell duplicates of the papers to various parties, but this led to a series of horrific events, including the disappearance of the papers and the madness of his accomplice, Cecil Hunter. As a result, Leiter was forced to flee the university, leaving behind his career and reputation.",
