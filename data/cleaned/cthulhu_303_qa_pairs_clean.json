  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document describes summoning spells in a fantasy setting, which involve binding and commanding supernatural entities, known as \"things\" or \"servitors.\" To cast a summoning spell, a wizard must spend magic points, time, and sanity points, and must also provide a specific command or order for the summoned entity to follow. The success of the spell depends on various factors, including the wizard's skill, the entity's strength, and the conditions under which the spell is cast. Each summoning spell has its own unique characteristics, such as the Summon Byakhee, which requires a whistle and is active only on nights when Aldebaran is above the horizon.",
