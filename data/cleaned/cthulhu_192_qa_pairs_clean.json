  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, investigators who encounter evidence of the cosmic horror can gain knowledge and skills, but also risk losing Sanity points. Becoming a believer in the Mythos requires a direct experience with a deep one or a manifestation of a god, which can cause immediate loss of Sanity points. Investigators can choose to remain nonbelievers until they encounter such evidence, and can even read Mythos books and learn spells without losing Sanity points. However, the loss of Sanity points is a permanent consequence of becoming a believer.",
