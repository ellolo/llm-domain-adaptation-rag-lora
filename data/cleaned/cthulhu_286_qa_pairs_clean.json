  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document outlines various \"Contact\" spells in the Cthulhu Mythos, which allow a caster to establish a connection with supernatural entities, such as servitors, spirits, star-spawn, and deities. These spells require specific conditions and preparations, including the use of magic points, sacrifices, and specific locations. Successful casting of these spells can grant the caster access to the entity's knowledge, powers, or even a spell, but also risks the caster's sanity and well-being. The costs and risks associated with each spell are detailed, with some spells requiring specific materials, locations, or sacrifices.",
