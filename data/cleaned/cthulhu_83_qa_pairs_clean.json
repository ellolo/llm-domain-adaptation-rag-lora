  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the rules for investigative skills in a fictional game are outlined, specifically for Pushed rolls, which involve taking risks or using extra effort to achieve a goal. Failing a Pushed roll can have severe consequences, such as physical harm or getting caught in a trap. The document also introduces the concept of Track, which allows investigators to follow tracks and trails, and provides guidelines for setting difficulty levels and resolving potential consequences. Additionally, it discusses specializations in skills like Fighting, Firearms, and Survival, highlighting transferable benefits and similarities between related specializations.",
