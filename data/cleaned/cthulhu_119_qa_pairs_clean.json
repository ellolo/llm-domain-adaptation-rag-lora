  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document appears to be a ruleset for the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, specifically detailing mechanics for combat and firearms attacks. The document explains how to resolve fighting maneuvers, including the use of armor and the resolution of firearms attacks, which involve rolling a 1D100 and comparing the result to the attacker's relevant skill. The document also outlines modifiers that can be applied to firearms attacks, such as diving for cover, which can grant or impose penalty dice. Additionally, it provides examples of armor and firearms, including their respective difficulty levels and potential modifiers.",
