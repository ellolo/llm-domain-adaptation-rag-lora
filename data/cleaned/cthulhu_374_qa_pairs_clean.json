  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, the Great Old One Cthulhu is known to send terrifying dreams to mortal men, which can drive them to madness. When a person receives these dreams, they must make a Sanity roll to determine the extent of the damage, and the Keeper determines the duration of the dream-sending, typically lasting 1D20 days. Cthulhu's attacks are brutal and devastating, with the ability to scoop up multiple investigators and deal massive damage. The cultists who believe in the power of Cthulhu's dreams often view the recipients as honored and worthy of respect, but the effects of the dreams can be catastrophic.",
