  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document appears to be a ruleset for a tabletop role-playing game, outlining various mechanics and concepts such as skill rolls, difficulty levels, and character attributes. Key concepts include the use of 1D100 rolls to determine success or failure, with specific thresholds for success and failure (e.g. 96-100 for automatic failure, 50 or above for automatic success). The document also defines various terms such as \"Hard success\", \"Extreme success\", and \"Insanity\", which are used to describe different levels of success or failure in the game. Additionally, it outlines rules for character healing, injury, and combat.",
