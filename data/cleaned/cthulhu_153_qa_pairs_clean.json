  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the rules for handling chases and hazards in a game are outlined. When a character is in a chase, they can attempt to navigate through the crowd or environment, using skill rolls to determine their success. The Keeper can use various guidelines to determine the success of these rolls, including the character's abilities, the environment, and the monster's or NPC's abilities. Additionally, rules are provided for handling vehicular collisions, where the damage and casualties can be determined using a table and rolling dice.",
