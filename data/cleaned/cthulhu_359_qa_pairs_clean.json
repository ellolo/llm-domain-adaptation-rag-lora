  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes two terrifying creatures from the Mythos of H.P. Lovecraft: Shantaks, winged elephantine mounts, and Shoggoths, massive, amphibious creatures. Shantaks are known for their ability to form limbs and eyes, and are often found as servants of other races. Shoggoths, on the other hand, are highly intelligent and imitative, with the ability to form appendages and mimic other life forms. Both creatures are formidable opponents, with Shantaks dealing 1D6 + damage bonus damage and Shoggoths dealing 2D6 + 2 damage per round. They are also known for their ability to cause sanity loss and destruction to their victims.",
