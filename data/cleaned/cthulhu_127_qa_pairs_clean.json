  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the effects of damage on a character's health are outlined. Regular damage, which is less than half of the character's maximum hit points, has no significant effect on the character until their hit points reach zero, at which point they become unconscious. In contrast, major wounds, which are equal to or more than half of the character's maximum hit points, can be fatal and require immediate medical attention. The severity of damage also depends on the type of attack, with single punches likely to result in regular damage and single gunshots more likely to inflict major wounds.",
