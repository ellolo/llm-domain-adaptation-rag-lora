  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, investigators gain points by encountering and studying the Mythos, which can lead to increased Cthulhu Mythos skill but also risks to their Sanity. The Cthulhu Mythos skill allows investigators to identify Mythos entities, remember facts, and manifest magical effects, but is often low and requires careful rolls to succeed. The skill has different levels of difficulty, including regular, hard, and pushed rolls, which can lead to consequences such as exposure to harm or activation of summoning spells. The skill also encompasses demolitions, including setting and defusing explosive charges.",
