  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document discusses the concept of \"spells\" in a fantasy setting, specifically how to create variations of a spell, such as the \"Create Zombie\" spell. The idea is to make the spellcasting process more nuanced and unpredictable, similar to a cooking recipe, with different ingredients, methods, and effects. The document provides examples of different versions of the Create Zombie spell, including a \"Grey Binding\" version that is faster and cheaper to cast, and an \"Improved\" version that is more effective but more expensive and time-consuming to cast. These variations allow game masters to tailor the spell to fit their game's needs and create a more immersive experience for players.",
