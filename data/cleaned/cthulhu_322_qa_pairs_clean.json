  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, monsters can pose a significant threat to investigators, requiring a thoughtful and strategic approach to combat. When fighting monsters, it's generally recommended to fight back rather than dodge, using the monster's basic Fighting skill. The Keeper should also consider the monster's POW and INT when determining its magical abilities, and should avoid simplistic death declarations, instead opting for more nuanced and descriptive descriptions of the monster's demise. Additionally, monsters may know spells, particularly those worshiping Outer Gods or Great Old Ones, and the Keeper should encourage creative and deep magic interpretations.",
