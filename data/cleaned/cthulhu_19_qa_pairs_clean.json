  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe created by H.P. Lovecraft, has evolved over time through the contributions of various authors, including Robert Bloch, James Wade, and August Derleth. Derleth's work, particularly his establishment of Arkham House, helped to ensure Lovecraft's stories would not be forgotten. The term \"Cthulhu Mythos\" was coined by Derleth, and fans and scholars have since debated its definition and explored the mythology. The Cthulhu Mythos has also inspired numerous writers, filmmakers, and artists, with many works drawing on Lovecraft's original concepts and expanding upon them.",
