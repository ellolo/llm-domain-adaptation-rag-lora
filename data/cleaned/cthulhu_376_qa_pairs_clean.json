  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nDaoloth, also known as The Render of the Veils, is a powerful, otherworldly being worshipped by cults on alien worlds, particularly Yuggoth. Its presence causes madness and disaster among humans, and if not contained, it can engulf and transport individuals to other dimensions. Daoloth is a shapeless, geometric entity that can move unconventionally, expanding its shape or slipping through dimensions. Its worship is associated with great power and risk, as it can grant its followers the ability to see into other dimensions and travel to other realities.",
