  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nEihort is a monstrous being, known as the God of the Labyrinth, that resides in a network of tunnels beneath England's Severn Valley. It is said to have a cult following in the cities of Brichester and Camside, where it is worshipped by demented humans who are led by a group of smaller, grub-like creatures called the Brood. Eihort's Bargain is a deal made with humans, where they are implanted with Brood, leading to progressively horrible and sanity-wracking dreams, ultimately resulting in the human's death. Eihort is a formidable foe, with high strength, power, and regeneration abilities, making it a powerful entity in the Cthulhu Mythos.",
