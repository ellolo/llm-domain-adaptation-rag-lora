  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Elder Sign is a powerful spell in the Call of Cthulhu and Elder Sign games that can activate a magical seal, protecting the caster from harm. To create an Elder Sign, a caster must sacrifice a varying amount of POW and lose 1D4 Sanity points, and the spell can be used to summon star vampires. The Elder Sign can also be used to create enchanted items, such as the Glass from Leng or the Lamp of Alhazred, which can have unpredictable advantages and disadvantages. Crafting an enchantment or artifact can bring risks, and gamekeepers should carefully consider the implications of introducing such items into the game. The spell requires a significant amount of POW and Sanity points to cast, making it a challenging and potentially hazardous option for investigators.",
