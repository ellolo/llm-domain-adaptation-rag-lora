  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document describes three spells from the Mythos system: \"Dust of Seeing\", \"Sigil of Banishment\", and \"Red Sign of Shudde M'ell\". The \"Dust of Seeing\" spell makes magical invisible things visible, while the \"Sigil of Banishment\" spell creates an ankh that can banish individual Mythos creatures. The \"Red Sign of Shudde M'ell\" spell is a more malevolent spell that causes victims to die horribly. These spells involve the use of magic points, Sanity points, and specific ingredients, and can have significant effects on the game world and its inhabitants.",
