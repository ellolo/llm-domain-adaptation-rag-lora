  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the role-playing game Call of Cthulhu, the use of dice is not always necessary to resolve conflicts or challenges. The Keeper has the final say in determining which skills or characteristics to roll, and the goal of the player should be clearly stated before rolling dice. The game encourages players to negotiate and resolve conflicts without rolling dice, but in situations where tension or drama is required, dice rolls can be used to determine the outcome. The Keeper's decision is final in cases where the rules do not provide a solution, and players should respect the Keeper's decision and move on with the game.",
