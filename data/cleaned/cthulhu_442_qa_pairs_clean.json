  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Arkham Witch Trial Papers, a valuable collection, are stolen from Professor Charles Leiter, who had been hired to sell them. Leiter's attempts to create forgeries and protect himself from those who wanted the papers ultimately lead to his downfall, as he is killed by a mysterious and malevolent force. The incident sets off a chain of events, as the university's Dean Fallon seeks outside help to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Leiter's death. The scenario is designed to be roleplayed through conversations with the characters, allowing the Keeper to flesh out the details and create a unique experience for the players.",
