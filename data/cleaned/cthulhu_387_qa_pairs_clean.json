  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nNyogtha, a minor deity from the Call of Cthulhu universe, is a blob-like entity that inhabits underground caverns and feeds on human sacrifices. It has a few worshipers, mostly witches and ghouls, who offer it sacrifices and POW in exchange for spells and knowledge. Nyogtha is a formidable foe, capable of dealing massive damage and dragging victims into underground pits. In contrast, Rhan-Tegoth, another minor deity, is a hibernating, amphibian-like being that requires blood sacrifices to feed and can be awakened by modern men.",
