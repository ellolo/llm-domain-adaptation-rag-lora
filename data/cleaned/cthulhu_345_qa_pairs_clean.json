  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Great Race, a highly advanced and intelligent species, flourished on Earth from approximately 400 million to 50 million years ago. They were eventually exterminated by the flying polyps, but not before they developed a technology that allowed them to travel through time and space, conquering other planets. The Great Race reproduce by spores and have a long lifespan, and they value intelligence above all else, using it as a criterion for immigration. They possess a unique ability to trade minds with other beings, allowing them to travel through time and acquire knowledge.",
