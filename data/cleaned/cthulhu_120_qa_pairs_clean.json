  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, modifiers are introduced that can grant advantages or disadvantages to characters in a game. These modifiers include \"Diving for Cover\" (penalty die), \"Cover and Concealment\" (penalty die), \"Point-Blank Range\" (bonus die), \"Aiming\" (bonus die), \"Fast-Moving Targets\" (penalty die), \"Target Size\" (bonus or penalty die), and \"Reloading Firearms\" (possible penalty die). These modifiers can affect the difficulty of attacks, the accuracy of shots, and the effectiveness of defensive maneuvers. They provide a way for characters to adapt to different situations and gain an advantage or disadvantage in combat.",
