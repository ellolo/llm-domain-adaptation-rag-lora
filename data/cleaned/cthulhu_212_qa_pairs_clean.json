  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a tabletop role-playing game, the Keeper's role is to facilitate the game by asking questions and guiding the players' actions. To encourage descriptive storytelling, the Keeper should ask players to elaborate on their actions, rather than simply stating the outcome of a roll. This approach allows the Keeper to differentiate between descriptive color and mechanical effect, and to encourage players to create their own narrative. By doing so, the Keeper can create a more immersive and engaging game experience.",
