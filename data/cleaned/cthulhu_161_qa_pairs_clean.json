  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn Call of Cthulhu, Sanity is a critical aspect of the game, representing the investigator's mental stability in the face of eldritch horrors. A failed Sanity roll results in the investigator losing Sanity points, with the amount lost depending on the situation or entity encountered. The Mythos is inherently corrupting and can drive investigators to the brink of insanity, with the threat of complete madness serving as a constant reminder of the horrors they face. Sanity points can fluctuate during play, but never exceed the character's maximum Sanity rating.",
