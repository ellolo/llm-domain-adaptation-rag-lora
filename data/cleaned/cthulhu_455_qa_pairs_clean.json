  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe \"yellowjackets\" are a pair of thugs from Atlantic City who are hired by Charles Leiter's creditors to collect a debt of $11,000. They are tasked with finding Leiter, who is believed to be dead, and are willing to use threats and violence to achieve their goal. The yellowjackets are largely ignorant of the truth and are driven by their desire to collect the debt, making them a potential threat to the investigators. They can be played as a rival to the investigators, a source of physical action, or even an unlikely ally, depending on the Keeper's discretion.",
