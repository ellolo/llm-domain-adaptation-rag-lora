  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nA \"Crawling One\" is a monstrous entity composed of thousands of worms and maggots, each with a collective mind driven by the \"will\" of a dead sorcerer. These creatures possess special powers, including the ability to cast spells, use weapons, and communicate through written messages. They are vulnerable to physical attacks, but can dodge them with a 20% chance. The Crawling Ones are also susceptible to mental attacks, which can drain their magic points and sanity, and can be defeated with a successful opposed roll.",
