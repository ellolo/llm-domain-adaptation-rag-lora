  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a chase scenario, characters and vehicles have a set number of movement actions based on their speed rating relative to the slowest participant. Each character can use their movement actions to move forward, initiate an attack, cast a spell, or perform other actions requiring time and dice rolls. The pursuer's speed and DEX rating determine their movement actions, with faster pursuers having more movement actions. The chase can be resolved quickly if the pursuer is faster, or it can become a stalemate if both characters have the same speed.",
