  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the game of Call of Cthulhu, combat is resolved through a series of rolls and checks, with the attacker and defender making opposed rolls to determine the outcome of an attack. The combat flow chart outlines the order of attack, the resolution of attacks, and the rules for dodging, fighting back, and maneuvering. Additionally, the game includes rules for dealing with damage, including the effects of a Major Wound, which can be healed or worsened over time. The game also includes rules for chases, where fleeing characters or vehicles are pursued by pursuers.",
