  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, a \"Bout of Madness\" is a temporary state of insanity that can befall investigators, lasting anywhere from 1D10 combat rounds to several hours or even indefinitely. During this time, the investigator's backstory, personality, and abilities can be altered by the Keeper, reflecting their descent into madness. The Keeper and player work together to add or revise entries to the investigator's backstory, which can include new traits, phobias, and manias, as well as changes to their possessions, injuries, and arcane abilities.",
