As a result, Harvey is committed to an institution for assessment, where he escapes and heads towards Arkham. The court then decides to appoint a guardian to oversee Harvey's care, which can lead to various outcomes, including commitment to an institution, home care, or therapy. The guardian's authority is general, and Harvey has three ways to leave the institution: convincing the guardian to release him, convincing the staff to report his restored mental balance, or escaping physically.",
