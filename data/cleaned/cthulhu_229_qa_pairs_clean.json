  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a role-playing game, the rules for non-player characters (NPCs) are often more flexible than those for player characters. When an investigator interacts with an NPC, the Keeper can choose to apply the standard damage rules or allow the investigator to describe the outcome without a roll. The Keeper can also use their discretion to determine the NPC's injuries, perception, and recovery from harm. Additionally, the Keeper can use Luck rolls to determine the outcome of a chase, allowing the player to define the next locations and obstacles. This flexibility allows the Keeper to create a dynamic and unpredictable game world.",
