  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines rules for creating dynamic and memorable chase scenes in fiction, particularly in Lovecraftian horror stories. A chase scene should provide drama and excitement, with a string of challenging locations that test the characters' skills and speed. The rules assume a fleeing character has an escape route and provide a system for the Keeper to describe the situation, determine dice rolls, and incorporate the outcome into the story. The rules are presented in five parts, covering establishing the chase, laying out the chase, movement, conflict, and supplementary rules.",
