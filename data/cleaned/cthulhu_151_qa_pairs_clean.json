  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, rules for vehicle chases are outlined, including how characters can use firearms during a chase, target vehicle tires, and deal with vehicle damage. Characters can also choose to interact with a location in an alternative way, such as attempting to open a door instead of running down a street. Additionally, rules are provided for characters joining an ongoing chase, including speed rolls to determine movement rates and positioning on the map. Key concepts include the use of penalty dice, vehicle armor, and the consequences of vehicle damage.",
