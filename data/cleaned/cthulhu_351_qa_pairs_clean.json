  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Mi-go are a pan-dimensional, otherworldly species that resemble fungi, with brain-like heads that can change colors to communicate. They are able to fly through the interstellar aether on their great wings, but are clumsy in Earth's atmosphere. The Mi-go are inquisitive scientists, capable of advanced surgical feats and possessing special powers such as hypnosis, telepathy, and the creation of void light. They worship ancient deities like Nyarlathotep and Shub-Nigggurath, and often hire human agents to simplify their operations on Earth.",
