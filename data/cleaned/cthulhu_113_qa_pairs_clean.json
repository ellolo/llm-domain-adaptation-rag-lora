  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the context of a Call of Cthulhu combat, a \"maneuver\" is a deliberate action taken by a character to achieve a specific goal, such as disarming an opponent or inflicting damage. A successful maneuver allows a character to achieve one goal, which can be a physical action like disarming or restraining an opponent, or a more strategic action like placing an enemy at a disadvantage. The Keeper can also use maneuvers to inflict damage on characters engaged in combat. The document also discusses the concept of \"striking the first blow\" or \"surprise,\" where an attack is made without warning, and the rules for determining whether a character anticipates the attack.",
