  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a role-playing game, the Keeper uses an \"Idea roll\" to determine whether the players receive a crucial clue. The Keeper has complete control over the situation, but the outcome is determined by a dice roll, with the players having a chance to win if they have a high INT score. If the players win the Idea roll, the Keeper provides a strong clue that sets the story in a new direction. Conversely, if the players lose the Idea roll, they find themselves in deep trouble, facing increased danger and challenges. The Keeper must balance the difficulty of the Idea roll with the players' progress and the overall story arc.",
