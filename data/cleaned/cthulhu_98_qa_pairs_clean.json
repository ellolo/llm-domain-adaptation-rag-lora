  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game, the Keeper determines the difficulty level for non-player characters (NPCs) based on their skills and the player's goals. The Keeper can adjust the difficulty level based on the player's actions, such as attempting to intimidate or persuade an NPC, and can also impose penalties or rewards for specific circumstances. The Keeper's decisions can significantly impact the outcome of a scene, and may require the player to make skill rolls to succeed. The Keeper's discretion is key in determining the success or failure of a player's actions.",
