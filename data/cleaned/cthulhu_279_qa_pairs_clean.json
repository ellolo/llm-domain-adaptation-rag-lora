  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe \"Space-Mead\" spell allows a traveler to journey through space, requiring a specific amount of magic points and Sanity points to be expended. The spell's effectiveness depends on the distance traveled, with more points required for longer journeys. The spell also involves a risk of summoning a Mythos deity, which can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the deity's motivations and the traveler's preparedness. The spell's success is determined by a combination of magic points, chanting time, and the caster's Sanity points.",
