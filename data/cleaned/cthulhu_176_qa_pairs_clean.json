  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document outlines a rating system for the severity of insanity, ranging from 3-100 points, with 50 being the average. Investigators who are committed to an asylum or sanitarium for treatment must undergo psychiatric observation and evaluation, and the asylum's report will determine their fate. Treatment within an institution can be successful, with a roll of 01-50* resulting in a success, but can also be unsuccessful, leading to further treatment or rebellion. The document also provides guidelines for the treatment process, including the use of psychiatric medications, therapy, and electroconvulsive treatment.",
