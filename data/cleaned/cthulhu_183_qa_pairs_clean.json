  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nStudying the Cthulhu Mythos, a collection of dark and occult texts, requires dedication and caution. These ancient, often cryptic books hold powerful insights and knowledge, but can also be hazardous to read, as they may contain forbidden knowledge that can drive readers mad or even incinerate them. To access these texts, investigators must first translate the language, if unknown, and then carefully handle the physical book, which may be fragile or even \"living\" and malevolent. The risks of reading these texts are real, and investigators must be prepared to face the consequences.",
