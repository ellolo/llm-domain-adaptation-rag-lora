  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Cthulhu Mythos, Nodens is a powerful deity, often depicted as a grey-bearded human, who serves as the Lord of the Great Abyss. He is known to aid humans in times of need, but typically avoids physical confrontations. Nodens has no cult on Earth, but is served by nightgaunts, and his abilities include summoning nightgaunts, dismissing enemies, and healing himself. In contrast, Nyarlathotep is a dark god with a thousand forms, known for causing madness and insanity, and is often depicted as a messenger, heart, and soul of the gods.",
