  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Union Army has fled to the Canadian border, and the investigators are tasked with gathering information about the whereabouts of the army's commander, Strong. To gather information, the investigators can speak with local townsfolk, hunters, and other individuals, who may share rumors and stories about the forest, including tales of ghosts, Indian burial grounds, and ancient evils. The investigators will also be searching for the army's commander, who is believed to be hiding in the forest, and will be following a north-easterly route to the reservoir site. The investigators will encounter various obstacles and challenges as they search for the commander, including the sound of wood breaking up ahead and the presence of a pair of people with rifles on the trail.",
