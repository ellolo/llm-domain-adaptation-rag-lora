  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document appears to be a section from the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, detailing various spells and incantations that can be used by wizards to manipulate and control others. Three specific spells are described: \"Create Zombie\", which brings a corpse back to life to perform mundane tasks, \"Curse of the Putrid Husk\", which induces terrifying illusions and Sanity loss in a target, and \"Create Barrier of Naach-Tith\", which creates a magical and physical defense barrier that can be used to protect oneself or others. These spells require varying amounts of magic points and Sanity points to cast, and can have significant effects on the caster and their targets.",
