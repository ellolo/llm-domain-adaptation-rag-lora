  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, investigators can experience various levels of insanity, ranging from temporary bouts of madness to indefinite and permanent insanity. Temporary insanity lasts for 1D10 hours, while indefinite insanity can last for months or even years, depending on the situation. Permanent insanity results in the character ceasing to be a player character, with no hope of recovery. The Keeper must determine the end-point of madness for each character, and the effects of insanity can be unpredictable and game-changing.",
