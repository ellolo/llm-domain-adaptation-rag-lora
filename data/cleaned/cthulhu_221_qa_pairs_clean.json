  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nTo create a more engaging and immersive experience in a Call of Cthulhu game, it's essential to leave areas of doubt and uncertainty for the players to fill in. This can be achieved by not explicitly explaining the reasons behind certain events or clues, allowing the players to make their own deductions. Additionally, using the \"Yes, and...\" and \"Yes, but...\" principles can help incorporate the players' ideas and create a more dynamic and creative investigation process. The game master should also be prepared to adapt to the players' unexpected avenues of investigation and consider providing non-player characters with a Luck pool to make them more unpredictable and challenging.",
