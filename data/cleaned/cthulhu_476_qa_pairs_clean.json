  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn 7th Edition of the game, several changes have been made to character creation and gameplay mechanics. Hit points are now calculated by adding CON and SIZ and dividing by 10, rounding down, which may result in some enemies having fewer hit points than in previous editions. The Build system, which is derived from STR and SIZ, is also introduced, and movement rates are scaled values. Additionally, skills have been amalgamated or removed, and points from these changes can be redistributed among skills with the Keeper's permission.",
