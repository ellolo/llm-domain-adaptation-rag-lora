  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines rules for movement and combat in a fictional setting, specifically addressing the use of mounted weapons, movement distances, and shooting through cover. The rules provide guidelines for calculating movement distances, determining when attacks can be made, and applying penalties for shooting through cover or using mounted weapons. The document also introduces a system for determining the effectiveness of shooting through cover, taking into account the size of the hiding space and the type of cover. Additionally, it revises the point-blank bonus die rule to exclude long or cumbersome weapons.",
