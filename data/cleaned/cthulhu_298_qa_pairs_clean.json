  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines various mind control spells in a fictional system, including Domination of the Will, Mindblast, Mind Exchange, and Mind Transfer. These spells allow the caster to influence or control the target's mind, with varying costs in magic points and Sanity points. The effectiveness of these spells depends on the caster's POW roll against the target's, with additional requirements for more extreme suggestions or for casting on investigators. The costs and effects of these spells also vary depending on the target's INT and the caster's own INT.",
