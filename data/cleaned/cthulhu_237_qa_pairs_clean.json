  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn creating a Cthulhu Mythos game, the Keeper should aim to create a sense of atmosphere and transition for the investigators as they come to understand the true nature of the universe. This can involve shifting the tone from one of hope and optimism to one of dread and horror. The Keeper should also know when to end the game, using techniques such as cliffhangers, dramatic moments, or sudden changes in the scene to bring the story to a close. Additionally, the Keeper can use techniques like the \"Idea roll\" to determine the outcome of the final scene and create a sense of tension and uncertainty.",
