  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the rules for handling random hazards and barriers during chases in a game are outlined. When a chase is initiated, the Keeper can call for a \"Sudden Hazards\" roll, which can either hinder the investigators or provide them with an advantage. The Keeper and players can alternate calling for these rolls, and the difficulty level can be adjusted based on the length of the chase. Additionally, a \"Pedal to the Metal\" option allows a vehicle to move multiple locations in a single movement action, adding an extra layer of excitement to the game.",
