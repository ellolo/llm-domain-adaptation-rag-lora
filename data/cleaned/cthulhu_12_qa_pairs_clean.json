  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nTo play the Call of Cthulhu game, players will need a set of roleplaying dice, including percentile dice (D100), and a few other materials such as paper, pencils, and a quiet place to play. The game is based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and players are encouraged to read at least one story before starting the game. The game requires a Keeper and at least two players, and can be played in a relatively short amount of time (three to four hours). The roleplaying dice are used to generate random numbers for various game mechanics, such as hit points, sanity loss, and investigator creation.",
