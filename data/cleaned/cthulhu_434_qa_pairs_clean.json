  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this Call of Cthulhu scenario, investigators must prevent Gla'aki, a malevolent deity, from collecting its undead servants and draining the power from a crystal. To achieve this, the investigators can either free the prisoners, destroy the pulley and/or crystal, or kill the undead workers. The outcome of the scenario can have significant consequences, including the investigators' sanity and reputation, as well as the fate of the prisoners and the progress of Gla'aki's plans for freedom. The scenario is designed to be relatively low-lethality, but can be escalated by introducing Civil War-era weaponry for the undead servants.",
