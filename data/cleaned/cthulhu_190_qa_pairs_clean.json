  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this system, casting a spell requires a casting roll, which determines the success or failure of the spell. The first time a spell is cast, a Hard POW roll is required, and subsequent uses do not require a casting roll. If the casting roll is successful, the spell's outcome is determined by the spell description, but if the roll is failed, the caster must pay the cost of the spell, which can result in negative consequences or even death. The caster can choose to push the casting roll, which can either succeed or fail, but may also incur additional costs or consequences.",
