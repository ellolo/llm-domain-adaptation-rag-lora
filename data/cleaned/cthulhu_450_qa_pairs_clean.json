  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes a malevolent character, Flinders, who is after the Witch Trial Papers and will stop at nothing to obtain them. If chosen as the culprit, Flinders will break into Hunter's apartment and steal the papers, but will soon find himself in grave danger due to the supernatural events surrounding the papers. In contrast, Lucy Stone, a witness to Leiter's life, is a complex character with a troubled past, having worked as a waitress, artist's model, and dealer in rare books. She is emotionally invested in Leiter's life and is trying to pay her respects, but is being denied access to the body.",
