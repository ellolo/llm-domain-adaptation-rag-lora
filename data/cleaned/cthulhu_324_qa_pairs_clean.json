They are highly intelligent and can communicate with each other telepathically, allowing them to control other species and sense other minds. Chthonians are found worldwide, including in the depths of the Earth and in the oceans, and are known to be protective of their young. They have a complex social structure, with different stages of development, and are capable of causing powerful earthquakes. Their powers and abilities make them a formidable and enigmatic species.",
