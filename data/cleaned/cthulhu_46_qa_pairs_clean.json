  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document discusses methods for creating investigators in the Call of Cthulhu tabletop role-playing game. There are five options for allocating characteristic values: using the default method, point-buy, the Quick Fire Method, Reaching the Heights of Human Potential, and an optional rule to cap starting skill values. Each method has its own set of rules and guidelines for allocating characteristic values, occupation skills, and other attributes. The document also provides a quick reference chart for determining half and fifth values for characteristic and skill values.",
