  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Mythos, advanced scientific equipment and magical artifacts often blur together, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. The Mi-Go, a technologically advanced alien species, have brought significant technological advancements to Earth, including mining and war-related equipment. They also possess dark technology, such as the Shining Trapezohedron, and have developed advanced medical and surgical techniques, including the ability to preserve human brains for thousands of years. The Mi-Go guard their technology jealously and will pursue anyone who attempts to steal it. Additionally, the Mi-Go use a bio-web armor, a semi-luminous green slime that provides protection against various attacks, and the Black Lotus Powder, a mind-bending psychedelic used for torture and extraction of information.",
