  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn this document, the rules for character creation and combat in a Lovecraftian setting are outlined. The \"Damage Bonus\" (DB) and \"Build\" are calculated by adding the character's Strength (STR) and Size (SIZ) scores, and then looking up the result on Table 1: Damage Bonus and Build. This value is used to determine the effectiveness of the character's physical attacks, with higher values resulting in increased damage. The document also outlines rules for hit points, movement rate, and occupation, which all contribute to the character's overall abilities and performance in the game.",
