  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThis document outlines the characteristics of investigators in a role-playing game, specifically their Intelligence (INT), Power (POW), Education (EDU), and Sanity (SAN) points. INT determines the investigator's ability to learn and solve complex puzzles, while POW affects their magical abilities and resistance to magic. EDU measures the investigator's formal and factual knowledge, and SAN represents their mental stability. These characteristics are used to create and define investigators, with each characteristic influencing their skills, abilities, and roleplaying opportunities.",
