  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tabletop game, resolving firearm attacks involves rolling dice and applying modifiers to determine the outcome. The difficulty level of the attack, ranging from Normal to Extreme, affects the roll, with Extreme being the most challenging. The type of damage dealt also varies, with Minor, Moderate, Severe, Deadly, Terminal, and Splat categories representing increasing levels of harm. Additionally, malfunctions and poison effects can also impact the outcome of the attack.",
