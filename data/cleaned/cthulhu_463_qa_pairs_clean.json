  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document describes the manifestations of a Horror, a supernatural entity bound in blood and ink, which is unleashed when the Witch Trial Papers are copied. The Horror's effects can be seen in various ways, including disruptions to electrical systems, eerie lights, unexplained disturbances, and possession of individuals who have touched the papers. The document also outlines three principal means of combating the Horror: removing the original papers from harm's way, using the papers to attack the Horror, or creating one's own manifestations to counter its effects. These manifestations can be used by \"Keepers\" to narrow down suspects and searches, and can be used to narrow down the scope of the Horror's influence.",
