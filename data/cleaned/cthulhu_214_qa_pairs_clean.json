  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nIn a role-playing game, the Keeper can use verbal conflicts to create tension and challenge the players' characters. When a non-player character (NPC) is coerced, the Keeper must decide when to use persuasion, intimidation, or other tactics, taking into account the NPC's skills, motivation, and the players' approach. The Keeper can also use verbal conflicts to introduce delusions or madness, as seen in the example of the investigator losing his sanity after being confronted by a seemingly hostile NPC. Effective use of verbal conflicts requires a balance between roleplaying and dice rolling, with the Keeper working within the story's constraints.",
